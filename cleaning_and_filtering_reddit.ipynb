       "array(['Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF GIF: Sam Woolley (Gizmodo)Whether it’s a series of blinking ellipsis or an explicit notification that “someone’s typing,” the messaging feature known as a typing indicator is both a useful tool and a source of anxiety for many people. But knowing more about how it works can at least limit the guessing games that cause us stress.“Hi,” your boss types in the Slack DM, and then appears to type for 10 minutes. What the hell are they typing? What’s happening? Did they just type a sentence and walk away and this damned thing is continuously reassuring you that you’re definitely getting fired? Maybe.AdvertisementOr, your significant other types, “we need to talk,” and the typing indicator keeps popping up and disappearing. Are they adding on to a thought? Are they constantly erasing what they just said, so they can say, “I’m just not into you” with the cleanest execution possible? Probably.Like many people who work in an office these days, my interactions with co-workers are almost entirely relegated to Slack, a popular team messaging app. Outside of work, I use different messaging apps to keep up with friends and loved ones, and I’m allergic to phone calls. Someone is always typing. And like most people, I don’t think much about it unless it’s one of those potentially consequential incidents, at which point I turn into a neurotic basket case.In the interest of limiting my own freak-outs, I reached out to David Auerbach, a software engineer and author who started as an intern at Microsoft when he was 22-years-old and joined the company full time in 1999. He was assigned to the team working on MSN Messenger Service, and he helped build the first typing indicator into a major product. (Auerbach last year became the subject of a controversy involving Breitbart, which he characterized as “obvious bullshit.”)AdvertisementThe first thing I wanted to know was whether Microsoft held a patent on type indicators that everyone else pays to license. Auerbach said that he’s sure there’s some patent out there, but he doubts any other companies are licensing it. “The way tech companies work is that everything gets patented, but it’s rarely enforced—it’s more of a mutually assured destruction mechanism,” he explains. The idea being that if Microsoft went to Facebook demanding it pay up for one patent, Facebook would just counter with one of its own patents that Microsoft is violating. Just last year, Microsoft patented a new “enhanced” typing indicator with some minor cosmetic changes. And there are all sorts of tiny, little patents related to keyboard inputs that would probably grind the tech world to a halt if they were rigorously enforced.When Microsoft’s engineers first elected to add a typing indicator to Microsoft Messenger Service, it was at a time when the protocols of adapting real-world communication were still up in the air and emojis were still years away. But the notification served a more practical purpose than just humanizing communication: It let you know that the person you were speaking to was still on the line. “Back when it was a dial-up connection, someone could appear online that was actually disconnected because the disconnect wouldn’t register for a while,” Auerbach told me. This keep-alive mechanism just gave users another signal that they can rest easy that they weren’t speaking into the void. It was more a source of comfort than nervous anticipation.Of course, the world in which we live today brings an assumption that everyone is connected all the time. We may shrug and give it a pass when someone says, “hey, sorry I just got this,” two days after we sent them a text, but we know they saw it far earlier. Still, more people using chat online means there’s a greater need for a traffic cop, and that’s where typing indicator’s serve their most valuable function today. When 1o people are in a group chat or 100 coworkers are communicating in a single Slack channel, the indicator lets us know that we might want to reconsider interrupting others.AdvertisementIn the case of Microsoft’s early implementation of the feature, Auerbach’s memory is a little fuzzy on how it exactly worked, but he believes the notification that someone was typing would be triggered on the first keystroke and repeat as more keystrokes occurred. If no keystrokes were registered after five or 10 seconds, the indicator would no longer be displayed on the other end. As far as he can remember, that was the only function—a user was either typing or not typing—and the addition of “Jane has entered text” came later.For the most part, notifying users that someone has “entered text”—meaning, they wrote something but might not be actively typing—isn’t as widely used today as it was in the mid-aughts. Which also leads to the question of whether a service is simply saying someone’s typing when they merely entered text and stopped. We can’t say definitively that no service uses such an idiotic system today, but it’s highly unlikely. Not only would that be annoying, but back in Auerbach’s days at Microsoft, the team estimated that 95 percent of the messages flowing through the servers were just that constant repetition that someone was typing. Only 5 percent of the messages were actually the finalized communication being sent to a user.Unfortunately, the fact that every service isn’t jumping off of Microsoft’s template means that everyone tends to tailor their typing indicators a little differently. It would probably take more time to explain the ways in which every messaging service offered by Google handles the feature than anyone would want to read. But just to take one example, Slack sent us a basic rundown of how its particular approach to typing indicators works:Slack sends the typing indicator to you when a user is doing the following: Typing (as soon as they start typing, but not if they have only clicked in the text box)When they are not issuing a slash command (ie. starting their input with /)When they are not issuing keyboard shortcuts (ie. cmd+[ to switch channels or up arrow to edit)If a user stops typing for 5 seconds, Slack removes the indicator that they are typing. Slack shows the following message templates in the indicator:“Jane is typing” (one user)“Jane and John” are typing (two users)“Several people are typing” (three or more users) - fun fact on this, Slack’s blog is named after this indicator.AdvertisementIt’s also worth noting that you can turn typing indicators off in Slack.As for other platforms, they seem to work in much the same way. Facebook wasn’t quite as detailed in their response but Messenger’s typing indicator is pretty simple Hany Barakat, Engineering Manager at Messenger, told us.You will only see the typing indicator when a person is actively typing, so it won’t show up if someone has simply entered the text box and might not actively be engaging with the conversation.It will no longer appear once the person stops typing.Our tests showed that the typing indicator shows up immediately in Messenger as soon as a single character is entered, even if that character is a space, and the indicator disappears 5-1o seconds later if no more characters are entered.AdvertisementApple didn’t respond to our request for info, but our own informal test showed that iMessage’s typing indicator appears as soon as a single character is typed, and spaces without any characters activate it. It takes five seconds to disappear if you clear the text field and 60 seconds to go away if you simply stop typing. It also pops up if you load a picture without sending.Auerbach doesn’t particularly have regrets about the typing indicator but understands that it’s come to have a different place in our stressful multi-tasking lives. He does believe that every service should make it an option that can be shut off, and it definitely shouldn’t be included on every messaging platform. “That’s one thing I can think of that would make Twitter even worse,” he deadpans. For the love of god, Twitter, don’t get any ideas.',\n",
       "       '(CNN) On Monday night, in a CNN town hall in Jackson, Mississippi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren made some news: She supports getting rid of the electoral college as the method by which we elect presidents.\"My view is that every vote matters and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting and that means get rid of the Electoral College -- and every vote counts,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said, to raucous applause from the audience (The Democratic base is very much up in arms over the Electoral College, after Donald Trump won the White House in 2016 despite losing the popular vote by almost 2.9 million votes to Hillary Clinton).How realistic is what Warren is proposing? And how much -- really -- would it change how candidates campaign for the nation\\'s top job? To get some answers, I reached out to Sanford Levinson, a constitutional law expert and professor at the University of Texas Law School (Check out this talk Levinson gave at Harvard in 2016 for more of his thoughts on the Electoral College).Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.Cillizza: Warren said she favors abolishing the Electoral College to make \"every vote matter.\" Is that what getting rid of the Electoral College would do?Read More',\n",

It’s an age so low, it’s almost impossible to think about. But if you want to wrap your head around just how young Jonah is, try this: Consider the youngest child you’ve ever met. Now cut that age in half. Now, you’re in the ballpark of how old Jonah is.Apparently, it’s in the genes, too. Jonah’s brother Elliot is 7, while their sister Rebecca is just 11. The proud parents, Stephen and Molly, are pretty young themselves at 36 and 38, respectively, and family lore holds that when Jonah’s paternal grandmother came to America, she too was 3 years old (never confirmed).Someone might eventually surpass Jonah as the youngest, but for now, no one is even close.

      "Time spent on Facebook. Instead of having participants report their own use, they got the participants permission to monitor their use directly. Link to actual study in comments.\n",
      "A 2-Year Study of More Than 5,000 People Shows This 1 Activity Destroys Your Emotional and Physical Health\n",
      " \n",
      "Want to stay healthy, both emotionally and physically? Researchers from UC San Diego and Yale have some simple advice for you: Limit the amount of time you spend on Facebook. While this may sound like typical anti-social media crankiness from academia, this time they have some impressive research to back up their case. Holly Shakya, assistant professor at UC San Diego, and Yale professor Nicholas Christakis spent two years following 5,208 adults who are part of a Gallup long-term study. After asking permission, they monitored these subjects' Facebook use directly from Facebook, rather than asking subjects to report their own use. (People often don't realize how much time they spend on the social network.) And they checked in with subjects on their emotional and physical well-being, as well as their body-mass index (BMI), three times over the course of two years.\"Overall, our results showed that, while real-world social networks were positively associated with overall well-being, the use of Facebook was negatively associated with overall well-being,\" the researchers wrote in a Harvard Business Review article. \"These results were particularly strong for mental health; most measures of Facebook use in one year predicted a decrease in mental health in a later year.\" Yikes.Why is too much Facebook bad for your emotional health? Previous research has shown that the social network creates a sort of false peer pressure. Since most people are cautious about posting negative or upsetting experiences on Facebook, the social network creates a misleading environment where everyone seems to be doing better and having more fun than you are. As the researchers put it, \"Exposure to the carefully curated images from others' lives leads to negative self-comparison.\"No substitute for the real thing.But what of Facebook's magical ability to connect you to friends and family even when they're far away? To help you find long-lost friends and relatives? To help you keep up on what's going on with all the important people in your life? There's lots of research to show that having a social circle and an active social life and community leads to better health and greater longevity. The researchers wondered if a virtual social life and community would create the same benefits.No, they don't, as these results make clear--in fact they have the opposite effect. In addition to negative self-comparison, the researchers note, increased use of Facebook and other social media tends to take up a lot of people's time and can create an illusion of closeness. To the extent that time spent on Facebook takes you away from real-world social gatherings, you lose the benefit of being in a community, the researchers say. The same is likely true if you're at a gathering in body, but your eyes and mind are locked on your smartphone, checking out your friends' latest posts.\n"

       "'After Republicans lost control of the Senate this week, President-elect Joe Biden on Friday renewed his call for $2,000 stimulus checks. However, at least one Democrat opposes the idea.Democrats have secured control of the upper chamber by winning both Georgia Senate runoff elections, paving the way for the party to deliver the $2,000 direct payments that its leaders have been promising over the past few weeks. With control of both congressional chambers, Biden on Friday demanded that the larger checks be included in the next coronavirus stimulus measure.\"We need more direct relief flowing to families and small businesses, including finishing the job and getting people $2,000 in relief,\" he said in Delaware. \"Six hundred dollars is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table and keeping the lights on.\"With the newly-elected Georgia senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, Democrats will have 50 seats in the upper chamber, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris now has the tiebreaking vote.To ensure the fatter checks are passed, Senate Democrats may need to circumvent the GOP filibuster by securing a simple majority of 51 votes. But at least one Democratic senator has expressed firm opposition to $2,000 stimulus checks.In a Friday interview with The Washington Post, Joe Manchin of West Virginia said \"absolutely not\" to $2,000 direct payments, and stressed that \"getting people vaccinated is job number one.\"\"How is the money that we invest now going to help us best to get jobs back and get people employed? And I can\\'t tell you that sending another check out is gonna do that to a person that\\'s already got a check,\" he said.In a later tweet, Manchin said that the next round of stimulus checks \"should be targeted to those who need it.\"If Manchin opposes the $2,000 checks, incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer would need to find at least one Republican senator for the measure to pass. Several Republicans, including Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have already strongly supported increasing the recently passed $600 checks to $2,000.Newsweek reached out to Biden\\'s transition team for comment.President Donald Trump pushed to fatten the second check to $2,000 before he signed the latest coronavirus relief bill late last year. A measure to boost the payments passed the House, but outgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a standalone vote.Schumer will soon be the lawmaker who decides the bills that reach the Senate floor. After the Georgia runoff elections, the top Democrat said allowing a vote on the checks would be \"one of the first things that I want to do.\"Biden made a last-minute plea to Georgians on the eve of the runoffs by vowing to deliver $2,000 checks if Democrats have control of all three branches of government.\"Georgia, there\\'s no one in America with more power to make that happen than you, the citizens of Atlanta, the citizens of Georgia and that\\'s not an exaggeration. That\\'s literally true,\" he said. \"If you send Jon and the reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people who are struggling right now.\"Both Warnock and Ossoff also campaigned on the promise to deliver $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans.'"

      "As the wall between worlds comes twain, and the spooks and spectres seep on in, our thoughts turn to the graveyard of Linux distributions.For every spirited Ubuntu there’s a spiriting celebrity-based spin; for every Gentoo based success is a gOS shaped abscess, decaying in the mausoleum of popularity.In this fiendishly frightful blog post we’re going to look at three of the most diabolical Linux distributions ever summoned.Hannah Montana LinuxSweeter than a toffee apple bobbing in a bucket of syrup, Hannah Montana Linux is sired after the saccharine Disney poster child turned pop star of the same name.The derided distro lumbered into life back in 2011, based on Kubuntu 3.x and sporting a hellish ‘Hannah Montana theme’.Pitched as ‘fast, stable and powerful’, the OS was billed as being impervious to Windows viruses, and immune to irony.Hannah Montana Linux hasn’t been updated since it was created, and ships with gaping security holes the size of maggot-riddled eye sockets. Yet still the OS shuffles along, snaring handfuls of downloads each and every month.Ubuntu Satanic Edition‘The distro isn’t for actual Satanists, but rather fans of metal music’There are dedicated spins of Ubuntu for Christians. There are dedicated spins of Ubuntu for luddites. So naturally course there is a dedicated spin for your local friendly neighbourhood SatanistsTo be totally fair the distro isn’t aimed at actual Satanists at all, rather fans of metal music as the distro says it “brings together the best free software and free metal music on one [CD]”.Yup, that’s right: it’s a Linux distro that comes pre-installed with a 50-minute album of the best Creative Commons-licensed metal music — rock on!Ubuntu Satanic Edition is based on an ancient version of Ubuntu 10.10, and ships with the antiquated GNOME 2 desktop (albeit one draped, naturally, in gothic clothes). It even calls its LiveCD the ‘Undead CD’.Replete with blood-red-on-black themes, fiery wallpaper choices, and some seriously dead software, Ubuntu Satanic distribution is actually not an awful release. In many ways it’s one that might be of archaeological interest to digital archivists, and while the theme is a battle for the eyes, it’s nowhere near as soul-gouging-ly insipid as the one used in Hannah Montana Linux!Rebecca Black OSThe OS that can only be used by on a Friday, after you get go downstairs, get dressed and have cereal.The developer behind the distro says they were inspired to name it “…my favorite celebrity after I saw some earlier Linux distributions named after celebrities, and also this KDE blog post”.Rather like Ubuntu Satantic Edition, Rebeca Black OS isn’t actually that scary, not unless you’re a huge fan of the X server. The distribution is notable for being one of the first live CDs to ship with a Wayland server (something it not only ships with).Like its namesake, Rebecca Black OS hasn’t faded into obscurity but turned its infamy to good use. The distro is now an actual OS that actual people actually use (albeit one to test Wayland with).Based on its SourceForge stats it has been downloaded 197 this week alone, and was last updated on October 9, 2016.Be sure to share any spooktacular distro spawn in the gaping comments chasm we’ve joyfully carved out for you below…\n"

       "'NintendoNintendo really does ruin everything. Allow me to explain.Two days ago, my 6-year-old son learned a new word, and that word was \"resilience.\"We were in the car. Just 15 minutes earlier his friend from school was visiting. There was an argument over a toy. I won\\'t bore you with the details, but the end result was wild: the visiting child 1 inch away from my own son\\'s face, screaming at the top of his 6-year-old lungs demanding my kid hand over an ooshie or a Beyblade. I can\\'t remember what exactly. Insanity.When I gently intervened, the child bizarrely burst into tears, inconsolable.\"Why was he crying?\" My son later asked innocently, as I was driving.\"He doesn\\'t have resilience,\" I said, immediately regretting it.\"What\\'s resilience?\" he asked.Great. Now I had to explain \"resilience\" to a 6-year-old, driving a car, in traffic. While my youngest son sang the first 10 letters of the alphabet on loop. Honestly, it\\'s a miracle my children are still alive.What is resilience? Good question.But first let\\'s talk about Nintendo and how it ruined my son.Josh Goldman/CNET\\'Minecraft Mario\\'On the day my son learned the meaning of the word \"resilience,\" Nintendo released a downloadable pack of 20 SNES games for the Nintendo Switch, free to anyone subscribing to Nintendo\\'s Online Service.I lost it. In a good way. As a 38-year-old man who enjoys video games there\\'s not a thing on this planet that evokes more nostalgia than SNES games.The SNES, aka the Super Nintendo, is one of the best game consoles made by human hands. It has a game library second to none and the ability to play these games on the Nintendo Switch for free is a real cause for celebration. Some absolute classics are on the list: Super Metroid, The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past, Yoshi\\'s Island.Both my children share my love of video games and I was looking forward to playing the games of my childhood with them. Children who terrifyingly refer to 8-bit and 16-bit Mario games as \"Minecraft Mario.\"No surprise here: they loved them.But one thing did surprise me: The difficulty. My 6-year-old is fairly competent at video games -- most recently he played and completed Super Mario Odyssey by himself on the Nintendo Switch -- but Super Mario World? A game with limited save points, one-hit kills and some fairly tricky platforming? It was a frustrating experience for a child used to the gentle coddling of today\\'s video games.\"Ah,\" I nodded in the most patronizing way possible. \"This is what video games were like when Daddy was little.\"When times were grim up north in my native Scotland, when we got an orange and a lump of coal in our Christmas stocking and we were thankful. When video games didn\\'t have constant checkpoints, or unlimited lives. When we played soccer with potatoes and walked 5 miles barefoot to school, through sleet, snow and hail.Look, I\\'m painfully aware I\\'ve become the worst possible 2019 version of my own grandparents. The absolute worst. I accept this.The MaverickI\\'m also a terrible parent. Terrible. Right now we\\'re driving to school and my son\\'s lunchbox has a handful of Ritz crackers in it. I\\'m lazy. I yell too much. Sometimes I boil two eggs, pour a tin of cold baked beans over them and call it dinner.But the one thing I\\'m obsessed with as a dad is making sure my kids are resilient. To me, resilience is the greatest gift a parent can bestow upon a child.My definition of resilience? The ability to push through difficult times. The ability to fail and keep trying till the job is done. To take pleasure in hard times and revel in the lessons learned. \"Your brain\\'s getting bigger,\" my wife and I tell both of our kids whenever something is pushing their limits physically or mentally.I do a bunch of stupid things in an attempt to build resilience.To earn pocket money, for example, I give my kids challenges. Yep, that\\'s right. I literally pay my children cash-money when they achieve something that pushed their limits. Some of these challenges are educational, some are utterly ridiculous. I once gave my kid $5 to jump in an outdoor swimming pool deep in the heart of winter. When he was 5, I gave him $10 because he taught himself how to front flip on a trampoline. He has $20 waiting for him when he learns his multiplication tables.Parenting is a dark, mysterious black hole that swallows logic instead of light.Does it work? No idea. And if someone says they know, they almost certainly don\\'t. Parenting is a dark, mysterious black hole that swallows logic instead of light. No one understands what works, and if they say they do they\\'re full of shit.All I know is I don\\'t want to pay my kids to do chores or win the science fair because children should do chores and win the science fair BY DEFAULT. I\\'d rather pay them to do flips and jump into swimming pools on really, really cold days.What can I say? I\\'m a maverick.Nintendo/Screenshot by CNETWe both screwed upAnyway. Back to video games. Back to Nintendo. It screwed up. Big time.Actually, you know what, we\\'re both to blame. We both screwed up.The screwup I\\'m referring to: the rewind function Nintendo has added to the SNES games available on the Nintendo Switch.It\\'s a convenience thing. If you die or you missed something important you can press the ZR and ZL buttons together and literally rewind the game, scrubbing your mistake from existence. It\\'s a concession of sorts. Old video games are less forgiving, Nintendo seems to be saying, so here … have a rewind function, you puny kids.I, in a moment of weakness, forgetting all my grand ideas about teaching resilience, showed my 6-year-old the rewind trick after he\\'d spent a good five minutes complaining about a boss battle in Super Mario World. \"Here, just do this,\" I said, grabbing the Switch impatiently.Rewind. Simple. Whoops.And that was that. Teaching moment gone. Having a hard time on that there video game son? Here\\'s how you can completely and utterly cheat your way to victory.So it\\'s Nintendo\\'s fault for making the goddamn rewind feature. But it\\'s my fault for showing my son how to use it. Game over man, game over.Now my son uses the rewind function constantly. He uses it every time he dies. He uses it when he loses a power-up. He uses it just for the hell of it, to the point where his use of the rewind function is almost a game in itself, designed specifically to create the \"perfect\" run, where nothing goes wrong, where everything comes easily.A world where no resilience is required.What the hell Nintendo? And what the hell past me? What were you thinking? Unraveling years of hard work with a feature that robs future Mark of the ability to use video games for convenient teachable moments, steeling my children for real life challenges to come.Now playing: Watch this: Trying out the Nintendo Switch Lite actually surprised...Is my kid gonna be able to use a rewind feature when he gets fired for turning up an hour late for work? Or getting a girl pregnant in high school?Is he gonna be able to push ZR/ZL when he doesn\\'t look twice before crossing the road and gets run over by a garbage truck?Nintendo, please. What are we doing here? What am I supposed to do? Be a better parent? It\\'s too late for that. I\\'m six years deep in this parenting gig and I\\'m a disaster. The worst. That\\'s why I need big corporations -- like Nintendo -- to make my job easier, not harder. Jesus. Nintendo: Delete the rewind function. Do my job for me. Is that too much to ask?I need all the help I can get.Originally published Sept. 12.'"
