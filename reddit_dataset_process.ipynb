    "context = 'As fears over the coronavirus outbreak spread, thousands of Americans are clamoring to buy face masks in an effort to protect themselves, sending prices soaring and leading manufacturers like 3M to ramp up production. However, experts say stocking up on face masks is actually misguided — and there\\'s a much simpler thing you could be doing right now to protect yourself.\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot the general public likely doesn\\'t realize about these masks — namely, that they are not the best way to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\\n\\nWearing a mask is more for people already showing symptoms of coronavirus and their caregivers than for people trying to prevent it\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it \"does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19,\" referring to the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Rather, experts caution that putting on a face mask without proper fitting and training could actually increase your risk.\\n\\n\"If it\\'s not fitted right, you\\'re going to fumble with it,\" explained Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar before a House Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday. \"You\\'re going to be touching your face, which is the No. 1 way you\\'re going to get disease, is unclean hands touching your face.\"\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you are already coughing and showing symptoms of possible coronavirus illness, that\\'s when wearing a mask could be helpful for protecting those around you.\\n\\n\"The data on the effectiveness of masks for preventing respiratory virus infections is not very clear, \" explains Dr. Andrew Stanley Pekosz of Johns Hopkins\\' Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"The best data suggests that if you are ill and showing symptoms, wearing a mask can reduce the chances that you spread the virus to others.\"\\n\\nCloth surgical masks are not helpful at all\\n\\nThe common surgical mask you might be picturing in your head will not help you at all, Pekosz said.\\n\\nA type called an N95 respirator mask, if properly fitted, can block large-particle droplets that may contain germs, but the FDA warns they cannot filter out \"very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs [or] sneezes.\"\\n\\n\"An N95 mask is the one that is most practical,\" Pekosz tells CBS News. \"It stops 95% of particles of a certain size. ... There is a N99 mask, which blocks 99% of particles, but that mask is difficult to wear for long periods of time because it is hard to breathe through it.\"\\n\\nRespirator masks are more expensive. The FDA also notes they are not designed to fit children or people with facial hair.\\n\\nEven a good face mask isn\\'t enough\\n\\n\"Masks shouldn\\'t be considered to be the sole item that can protect you from infection, but it can be one of several things that can help you stay uninfected,\" said Pekosz.\\n\\n\"Wash your hands frequently. Practice social distancing — stay 5 feet away from people to avoid being close enough to be exposed to respiratory droplets from that person. More specific guidance will be given by the CDC soon, but those two things should be practiced by people on a daily basis to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.\"\\n\\nAnd he adds, \"Get a flu shot — influenza has killed over 16,000 Americans this year and is still causing disease across the U.S.\"\\n\\nYou have to change masks every few hours\\n\\nIf you do go the mask route in spite of expert advice, it\\'s important to note that face masks have a very specific lifespan. While there are some with longer lifespans or that have replaceable filters, the most common face masks on the market are disposable and single use. Each one of those is only good for a few hours.\\n\\n\"You want to change masks every few hours to make sure that they are functioning properly and aren\\'t getting contaminated with virus particles on the outside,\" Pekosz tells CBS News. \"It\\'s not like putting one on protects you. One has to follow specific procedures to ensure you are using them effectively.\"\\n\\nBuying face masks for personal use could cause a shortage at hospitals\\n\\n\"There is a limited supply of masks and while companies are increasing their production, demand is increasing at a very high rate,\" cautions Pekosz. \"There will most likely be shortages of personal protective equipment at medical institutions and this may in part be driven by supplies being purchased by the general public. Emergency preparedness efforts will address supply chains, but there really is no reason for the general public to purchase large numbers of N95 masks.\"\\n\\nAmerica\\'s largest face mask manufacturer, Prestige Ameritech, is a small business based in Texas with only 100 employees. And while they have no problem fulfilling America\\'s normal demand for face masks and respirators, they are now struggling to keep up.\\n\\nMike Bowen, the company\\'s executive vice president, told CBS News that they now field orders of up to 100 million face masks and respirators a day. He also noted that while the company does not ship its products internationally, in the last 30 days it has sold between 1 million and 2 million masks to buyers who then sent them to others in China and Hong Kong.\\n\\nThis huge spike in personal orders is precisely what experts fear will cause a dangerous inventory shortage in American hospitals — a shortage that is entirely avoidable, given that there are no proven benefits to the general public wearing masks.\\n\\nThe best way to prevent coronavirus: Wash your hands\\n\\nThe right way to wash your hands\\n\\nExperts say washing your hands is the best way to prevent the spread of infectious illnesses like coronavirus. That\\'s because one of the most common ways infections spread is when people touch a contaminated surface and then touch their mouth or nose.\\n\\nWash your hands frequently and thoroughly. CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook points out that it\\'s especially important to make sure that you scrub the soap into your fingertips because they are simultaneously the part of the hand most often neglected and the part of the hand most likely to touch your face and spread disease.\\n\\nSoap and water is far more effective than hand sanitizer. If you\\'re using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, you should make sure that it contains at least 60% alcohol.\\n\\nBeyond that, the CDC advises that, whenever possible, you should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, avoid contact with sick people, cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze, and disinfect objects and surfaces frequently.'"

       "'<s>Did 60% of Californian\\'s get corona virus in December and mysteriously not die or go to the hosptial?</s></s>SAN FRANCISCO -- It\\'s a story that has been making headlines across the United States: Did Californians develop herd immunity after possibly being exposed to novel coronavirus last year?On Thursday, a fellow at Stanford\\'s Hoover Institute released the theory suggesting that what was perceived to be a nasty and early flu season in California was actually COVID-19 spreading undetected throughout the community.Our sister station KGO-TV in San Francisco sat down with Dr. Alok Pate l for more insight on what herd immunity means and what it would take for it to happen in California and the United States.\"Herd immunity is basically a percentage of the entire community who would need to be immune to an infection so the infection couldn\\'t spread from person to person. And so when we look at coronavirus, we talked about that number around two to three, that\\'s a reproductive number of how many people can be infected from one case. Now, with coronavirus, we\\'re suspecting that we would need about 50% to 60% of the population to be immune to it to achieve that herd immunity so it couldn\\'t spread like wildfire. We would need millions and millions of Americans to actually get either infected or vaccinated to get immune to create herd immunity that\\'s a huge number. And we\\'ll probably have a huge number of casualties and deaths. If you had infections in the millions.\"\"I think the latter is possible. A lot of people have mentioned that you know, we may have had COVID-19 here a few months earlier than we suspected it could have been spreading. But again, I would have to go back to the numbers, and really look at the fact that we\\'ve had so many cases, pop up all over the country, and you know people are dying they\\'re getting hospitalized or getting extremely sick. And before we were actually testing for COVID-19, those would come up as mysterious cases. So I would believe that local public health experts in positions still would have been saying like hey we\\'re having a lot of people hospitalized for something, and none of our tests are coming back positive and so that never came up. Now it\\'s possible in the past somebody may have died and they would have said you know this is pneumonia or respiratory failure, and they weren\\'t exactly calling it COVID-19. But again, if we say that 50 to 60% need to be infected at herd immunity. That\\'s hard for me to believe right now in the United States. We have about 19,000 deaths and 500,000 cases, that\\'s a little bit more than 3%. We\\'re going to be talking about 150 million Americans infected. Or better yet, getting them vaccinated which would actually do this in a safe way, get that herd immunity.\"\"We theorized that with this virus, like many others. You can get infected, you\\'ll build up antibodies, over time, and those antibodies will protect you from reinfection. Now, because this is a novel virus, scientists don\\'t yet know what it is defined as immunity, or even how long it lasts or how long it builds up. Those are the things that we really need to learn, hopefully from these serologic courses antibody test. It was just FDA approved on April 1, we need to see a lot more testing with antibody tests because that\\'ll really tell us how many people may have been exposed in the past, and how widespread this disease is among people who may not have had really serious symptoms or may not have been hospitalized.\"</s>'"

Elizabeth Warren made some news: She supports getting rid of the electoral college as the method by which we elect presidents.\\n\\n\"My view is that every vote matters and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting and that means get rid of the Electoral College -- and every vote counts,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said, to raucous applause from the audience (The Democratic base is very much up in arms over the Electoral College, after Donald Trump won the White House in 2016 despite losing the popular vote by almost 2.9 million votes to Hillary Clinton).\\n\\nHow realistic is what Warren is proposing? And how much -- really -- would it change how candidates campaign for the nation\\'s top job? To get some answers, I reached out to Sanford Levinson, a constitutional law expert and professor at the University of Texas Law School (Check out this talk Levinson gave at Harvard in 2016 for more of his thoughts on the Electoral College).\\n\\nOur conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\\n\\nCillizza: Warren said she favors abolishing the Electoral College to make \"every vote matter.\" Is that what getting rid of the Electoral College would do?\\n\\nRead More'],\n",
