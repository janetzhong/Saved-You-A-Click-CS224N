Millionaire Mocks Poor Woman with 3 Kids on Business Class Flight until Pilot Interrupts Him | The pilot is her husband. Whole story is entirely fictional.....Completely unbelievable writing to boot.,https://archive.is/HSoEb,https://www.reddit.com/r/savedyouaclick/comments/snjls6/millionaire_mocks_poor_woman_with_3_kids_on/,snjls6,2022-02-08,2813,4,TheCannonMan,,"This whole thing is total garbage, even considering it as fiction.
 The ""millionaire"" character is like a cartoon villain entitled prick.
 He assumes this woman is ""poor"" (despite flying with 3 kids in business class....) Because apparently she's dressed simplely which is obviously an indicator of wealth on a flight. 
Then he apparently takes a video call and presents to a business meeting on the flight.... Which is A) more annoying than I could imagine her kids are, and
 B) possible on what airlines crappy wifi exactly? I don't think that's even allowed.
But anyway then this mega prick moneybags shits all over her, tells her she's poor and should book economy next time, and scoffs at her small business cause he apparently runs a designer brand or something. 
But continuing the on the nose and completely unfathomable writing, then her husband turns out to be the pilot, who then *announces this over the intercom specifically thanking her by name*
In classic clickbait fiction this somehow leaves this dude speechless.
**BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE**
Then while apparently still in the air, the pilot makes a long dramatic speech about it being his first day back and appreciation for his wife,  **leaves the cockpit** and comes out to propose (again I guess).
Then everyone stands up (on a moving plane!) and claps cause of course... Then gives shithead money bags a dressing down for being a materialistic shithead. 
Then psych -- the whole story was made up by a ""professional"" writer.

1. Play the character as Zellweger's actual size and have people complain it's inaccurate and fat-shaming?
  
2. Have Zellweger put on the weight for real under the supervision of a nutritionist and then lose the weight in three months with her high-priced trainer so that she shows up at all of the press for the show looking Hollywood thin? That seems a bit fat-shaming, too, doesn't it? (And I don't blame her for not wanting to put weight back on again for a role. Bridget Jones's Diary was 20 years ago. It's a lot harder to lose weight when you're 50 than when you're 30.)
3. Cast an actor who is size-appropriate but has far less recognition than Zellweger and get one-tenth of the audience? People are putting in a lot of hard work on this show. Zellweger's presence will help them find an audience. 
  
4. Have Zellweger wear a fat suit just as she would any other prosthetic to resemble the character she's playing?
5. Play the role in a motion-capture suit and have her body modified using CGI?

I feel like 1 and 4 are the most viable options, but I'm sure some people will say that the studio should choose option 3. But who's going to help the studio make payroll when nobody watches the show?",108
