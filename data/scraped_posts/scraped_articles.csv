An 80-year-old woman was taken hostage in her home this week, and her family was alerted that something was wrong after she didnít read text messages or share her score on the popular word game Wordle.

Denyse Holt woke up in her home in Lincolnwood, Illinois, in the early hours of Sunday morning and saw a naked man holding scissors. The man allegedly threatened to cut her if she screamed and got into bed with her, according to multiple reports.

He later locked her in a bathroom in her basement. Holt told The Washington Post she was cold, hungry and in pain while trapped, as the man allegedly would not bring her food or medicine.

The Lincolnwood Police Department confirmed to USA TODAY that the suspect, identified as James H. Davis III, allegedly discarded his clothing early Sunday during a ìmental health crisisî before breaking into the womanís home. He collected the phones in the home and secured the door to the womanís bathroom with a chair.

USA TODAY has reached out to Holtís daughters for additional information.

While Holt was trapped and worried for her safety, her oldest daughter in California was growing concerned that her mom had not texted her Wordle score, a daily word game that gives players six tries to guess a secret five-letter word, according to multiple reports. Her other daughter, who also lives on the West Coast, noticed her mother had not responded to text messages.

What is Wordle?: The popular word game, explained

ìI didnít send my older daughter a Wordle in the morning. And that was disconcerting to her,î Holt told CBS2, the outlet that first reported Holt's story.

The women eventually asked police to do a wellness check, and officers discovered a broken window on the first floor of Holtís home at approximately 9:40 p.m. on Sunday. They freed her from the bathroom and notified the regional SWAT team. Law enforcement officials apprehended the man at approximately 3 a.m. Monday.

Davis has been charged with home invasion with a dangerous weapon, aggravated kidnapping while armed with a dangerous weapon and two counts of aggravated assault against a peace officer."

From Markets Insider on the impact of Apple's tracking privacy changes in iOS 14:

The earnings results from social media companies on Wednesday highlighted the weakness to investors, resulting in a steep sell-off in their stocks. In Thursday trades, Meta Platforms fell 22%, Snap fell 18%, Twitter fell 8%, and Pinterest fell 11%. Since Apple's privacy update went into effect in late April 2021, these four social media companies have erased a combined $278 billion in market value.

The report notes Meta's value has fallen by $169 billion since April 26, 2021. Similarly, Snap has fallen by $50 billion, Twitter by $26 billion, and Pinterest by $33 billion. For Snap, Twitter, and Pinterest, those losses represent around half of their previous market values, a staggering decline.

It comes after Facebook missed its Q4 earnings targets this week, and announced that it expects changes made by Apple last year to cost the company some $10 billion in revenue, sending shares in freefall on Wednesday, a trend that continued when the markets opened.

Apple made tracking users via an IDFA number an opt-in feature, as the company continues to highlight privacy as one of the best iPhone features on offer."

That's in contrast to most of its tech brethren. During a week where Apple reported that it had the most profitable quarter of any company, ever, and Google reported record numbers of its own, Facebook--for the first time--reported fewer daily active users. The number of overall users stayed mostly flat, but it's the measurement of how many people use the service on a regular basis that matters.

For the three months ending December 31, more people stopped using Facebook than signed up. That sent the company's stock tumbling as much as 25 percent, shaving $230 billion off its market cap. That's the most of any company, ever. The idea that the world's largest social media company has finally started to shrink is a sort of ""come to Jesus"" moment for investors who somehow thought double-digit growth would last forever.

Facebook's primary challenge is that it has so saturated the market of people who might use its service, there's almost nowhere to grow. Well, except the metaverse, of course. That version of the immersive internet, imagined by Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is likely still a decade away, at best.

For now, Facebook is shrinking. Really, that shouldn't come as much of a surprise, however. Sure, it's probably a shock that it's finally here, but it was inevitable that the company would stop growing. There are a finite number of human beings that are willing to sign up for its services, and it appears Facebook has finally reached that number.

That it made active user growth the measuring stick Wall Street would use to gauge its success is entirely of its own making. For years the line continued to grow up as it turned in massive growth in users. More users meant more ads, which meant more revenue, which meant more profits, which meant the stock kept going up.

Again, that's the business Facebook was selling as a success until it wasn't. Now that it's not working, Facebook and its CEO spent a lot of time doing what no business should ever do--blaming others.

It started on the call with analysts. Specifically, Mark Zuckerberg pointed at two tech rivals as the source of its problems: Apple and TikTok.

It's not the first time Facebook, which changed its name to Meta late last year, has complained about Apple's privacy changes in iOS 14.5. In late 2020, it took out full-page ads accusing Apple of harming small businesses and threatening the future of the free internet. Instead, Apple's changes simply require developers to request permission before their apps can track users.

That seems like common sense, but tracking users is the key to Facebook's business. Apple's change will cost the company as much as $10 billion in revenue in 2022, according to Facebook's estimates.

""With Apple's iOS changes and new regulation in Europe, there's a clear trend where less data is available to deliver personalized ads. But people still want to see relevant ads, and businesses still want to reach the right customers.""

To be clear, it wasn't just Zuckerberg that pointed the finger outside the company.

""Like others in our industry, we've faced headwinds as a result of Apple's iOS changes,"" said Sheryl Sandburg, Facebook's COO. ""Q4 was the first holiday season after Apple's iOS changes, which have had an impact on businesses of all sizes, especially small businesses who rely on digital advertising to grow. This will continue to be a factor in 2022.""

As for TikTok, Facebook pointed out that younger users aren't signing up for Facebook, preferring to spend their time elsewhere.

""People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time and apps like

TikTok are growing very quickly,"" Zuckerberg said. ""And this is why our focus on Reels is so important over the long-term. As is our work to make sure that our apps are the best services out there for young adults, ""

Then, Zuckerberg repeated the same finger-pointing at an all-hands meeting on Thursday, which was first reported by Bloomberg. There, he told employees that the company's focus was on its newest video product, Reels. The company first added the short-form video feature to Instagram (which is also owned by Meta), and later to Facebook. It's a direct copy from TikTok.

The thing is, you're never going to be a better version of your competition. If people are spending more time with your competition, they won't change just because you build a copy. It's not the first time Facebook has tried--it previously copied Stories from SnapChat--and it didn't really work there either. So again, the company is trying to pivot."

When McDonald's (MCD) - Get McDonald's Corporation Report veers away from variations on hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, and varying kinds of chicken chunks, it tends to fail.

McSpaghetti still exists in some global markets as does McPizza, but both failed spectacularly in the U.S.

The fast-food giant has some items on its global menus that cater to local tastes but wouldn't make sense for a broad U.S. release. In other cases, McDonald's tries menu items outside the U.S. that play off of how the world views Americans.

That has led to the creation of the Chicago company's newest menu items. These new McTreats borrow from an American culinary tradition that's well-known globally. And while these new items offer direct competition to Yum Brands' (YUM) - Get Yum! Brands, Inc. Report Taco Bell, some of them also offer a uniquely McDonald's take.

McDonald's Goes Southwest

Americans love Tex-Mex food. Nachos and fajitas have become favorite menu items not just at dedicated restaurants for that particular fare but at nearly every sports bar. It's hard to find a basic restaurant in the U.S. that does not offer a take on nachos, and now you can add McDonald's to that list -- but not in the U.S.

The fast-food chain has added nachos and a whole menu built around Tex-Mex favorites to its menu in Spain.

""The amazing Tex-Mex flavor comes to our restaurants with the incredible Grand McExtreme Nachos: delicious sauce of cheddar cheese, tomato, onion, double meat, and nachos inside the burger,"" the company wrote on the McDonald's Spain website (translated from Spanish).

In addition to the nachos-inspired burger, the new menu includes a number of other items, Brand Eating reported.

""McDonald's Nachos are your basic nachos with tortilla chips topped with nacho cheese sauce. It's joined by McShaker Fries and the new Grand McExtreme Nachos burger. McShaker Fries feature McDonald's signature fries served with a packet of cheese seasoning and a bag so you can combine and shake them to distribute the seasoning,"" according to the website.

Might McDonald's Bring Nachos to the U.S.?

McDonald's has tried a variety of burritos on its menu both for breakfast and on its lunch/dinner menu. The company also briefly tried selling fajitas, according to EatThis.com.

""McDonald's sold its own version of the popular dish in 1993. The fajitas included chicken, cheese, red and green bell peppers, and diced onions in a flour tortilla (with mild and spicy Picante sauce packets available upon request). McDonald's commercial claimed one bite of their chicken fajitas was like 'a taste of MexicoÖ without the sunburn,'"" the website said.

That item failed quickly (as do most new items introduced to the McDonald's menu).

Nachos, however, might be a better fit than fajitas because they require fairly little prep and require only two new ingredients: the actual nacho chips and a nacho cheese sauce.

Both of those ingredients, as we have seen on the menu in Spain, are also very versatile. Chips and nacho cheese sauce can go in burgers and the cheese sauce can be used with fries.

This may be McDonald's taking a page out of the Taco Bell playbook. But that's not unprecedented as Taco Bell actually sells fries (at least sometimes).

Nachos might be starting in Spain, but it's not unreasonable to think that these items -- at least some of them -- might eventually make their way to U.S. menus.

http://web.archive.org/web/20220209074319/https://www.yourtango.com/love/psychological-trick-make-someone-think-about-you-nonstop,"One of the most powerful ways to make someone fall in love with you is to program their mind to think of you all the time.

When you do this, it‚Äôs like planting a seed in the person's mind which grows and grows as each day passes ‚Ä¶until eventually the person begins to fall in love with you.

One of the easiest (and most powerful) ways to get someone to think about you is to share personal information with them.

Even when you alone share personal information with someone (even if they don‚Äôt initially share back with you), it can have a powerful effect on how their subconscious views you.

And how the person's subconscious views you is critical to making them fall in love with you.

How does this work?

When someone shares personal information with you, your subconscious mind becomes programmed into thinking that this person must be close to you. This is because only people who are close to each another share vulnerable thoughts and feelings.

And if you can program a person's subconscious mind into thinking the two of you are already close, it can make the person begin to accept this as an already existing fact. The person's subconscious has taken you out of the category of being just another ordinary person in their life ‚Ä¶ and into the category of being one of their close companions.

This is an IMPORTANT first step in the process of making someone fall for you.

The process of sharing personal information and secrets is in-and-of-itself an intimate act. And because the person wasn‚Äôt expecting this from you (until now), this will cause them to think about you more and more over the coming few days. ‚Äã

What kind of information should I share?

Right now, make a list of personal things going on in your life. It may be a family situation, a person situation at work, or an ambition or goal you have in your life. It should be something that not many people know about you.

When you are telling the person this information, it's important that they recognize that this is information which you are only sharing with a select few (and maybe even only them).

You might use lines like:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to keep this quiet, but today at work‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNot many people know this but my Mom is‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a personal situation at the moment at work. I was wondering if I could get your advice on it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou seem like someone who would know what to do in a situation I‚Äôm having at the moment. It has to do with‚Ä¶‚Äù

As you can see, all these lines emphasize the fact that what you are sharing is private and personal information and that the information has a certain level of exclusivity to it. It‚Äôs not something you would share with just anyone.

You are sending the persons subconscious the message that you feel comfortable enough with them to share such personal information with them. You are also displaying to the person's subconscious mind that you value the person's opinion (people love being made feel important) on something which is important to your life.

All of these INCREASE the level of rapport built by sharing the information in the first place.

Final Thoughts

Couples (already in a relationship together) regularly share personal information with one another. So by doing the above, you are helping to indirectly program the person's mind that the both of you might be potential couple material.

The fact that you are already sharing personal information with one another helps program their mind that you have (in some small way) already begun a defacto relationship‚Ä¶ simply by virtue of the fact that private personal information has been shared between you both.

This is one of the first key steps you need to take on the road to not only making someone think about you ‚Ä¶ but in making them fall in love with you.

That has created some challenging logistics for the company as it manages supply chains that supply restaurants all over the world with the ingredients required to offer that unchanging global experience.

For decades, the fast-food giant built its business on that consistency. Since the 1980s, however, McDonald's has also, to varying degrees, embraced the limited-time menu (LTO) offering. That is a selection of items -- some one-offs and some recurring that would entice lapsed fans to visit its restaurants or get regulars to spend more.

One of those Favorites, the Shamrock Shake, has been an annual LTO coming out around the Saint Patrick's Day holiday each year. That's partly due to its green color and partially because it was first promoted in ads by the character Uncle O'Grimacey, who was marketed as Grimace's Irish uncle.

McDonald's Brings Back Two Favorites

This year, the beloved mint-flavored shake makes its return to U.S. menus Feb. 21.

Shamrock Shake will be joined by the Oreo Shamrock McFlurry, according to McDonald's, and while the former has become a McDonald's institution, the latter is a newer but also well-liked.

The Shamrock Shake has been a Springtime standby since 1970. Made with vanilla soft serve, minty flavoring, and a dollop of whipped topping, the shake was introduced by Connecticut McDonald's Owner and Operator Hal Rosen to celebrate St. Patrick's Day, but the drink became so popular it helped fund the creation of the very first Ronald McDonald House, the chain's signature charity initiative.

More than 60 million of the shakes have been sold, in total. And when a product works, a company will always offer more of it. In 1980, it introduced the ""Shamrock Sundae"" for a limited time, which was a sundae with the signature mint-green Shamrock syrup.

In 2020, saw the creation The Oreo Shamrock McFlurry, which adds Oreo cookie pieces blended throughout the Shamrock Shake.

Why Does McDonald's Use LTOs?

The burger chain has, over the past few decades, embraced the idea of rotating items off and on its menus depending on the time of year, and many children grew up with fond memories of holiday-affiliated dipping sauce for their chicken McNuggets at the end of the year. (Introduced in 1987, the Holiday Chicken McNuggets package came with an apple-cinnamon dip and a cranberry-orange dip.)

But in 2012, the company truly embraced the marketing strategy, adding a variety of limited-time offerings after research showed that variety was of top importance to consumers. The company found that introducing new items, including the blueberry banana oatmeal and the Cherry Berry Chiller drink, would give frequent customers new options, which keeps them coming back and also help bring in new business.

Plus, excited fans would Tweet and post when news broke that their favorite items were coming back on the menu, which is always helpful in the online age.

It's an approach that other companies have started following in recent years, most notably with Starbucks (SBUX) - Get Starbucks Corporation Report and its signature Pumpkin Spice lattes.

To celebrate ""Shamrock SZN"" and hopefully get it trending, McDonald's is giving away one if its most closely guarded secrets, #cbf2ac, the hex code for the drinks' signature minty color.

Fans that tweet with the hashtags #cbf2ac and #ShamrockShakeSZN! could possibly get a little something extra, as the company has promised that ""starting Feb. 21, our Shamrock green hex code just might unlock another tasty secret. That is if you know where to look. Be one of the first to figure out the mystery and you could get a little something special from us."""

http://web.archive.org/web/20220216034150/https://qz.com/2127670/how-to-beat-inflation-at-the-grocery-store/,"Inflation continues to hit US grocery stores hard. Prices for groceries were 7.4% higher in January compared to a year before, the fastest year-over-year increase since 2008.

Inflation has not affected all food equally, though. Pantry staples that have stayed below the average increase include potatoes, cheese, tea, tomatoes, pasta, bread, ice cream, and fresh, processed, and frozen vegetables.

On the opposite end, price increases for steak and bacon remain in the double digits. High beef prices, fueled by labor shortages, more expensive feed, and high transportation costs, among other factors, have been one of the most visible aspects of high food prices.

As a category, meat has seen the most substantial increases, from poultry to pork chops, ribs, and bacon saw the highest price increases of any grocery store items. The market may be nudging savvy, or at least price conscious, shoppers toward a vegetarian, or flexitarian diet. Protein-rich beans (which are listed under the ‚Äúother fruits and vegetables including dried‚Äù category), saw an increase of 4.94%, below overall grocery prices.

Price fluctuations

In general, food prices are known to be relatively volatile, influenced by factors like agriculture and energy policy, commodity market speculation, extreme weather, rising demand, and decline of surplus storage‚Äîjust add a pandemic to create a perfect storm.

For instance, the price of flour, is up 10.33%, due to several factors. Last year, a drought across the US Great Plains region reduced the supply of wheat, which is used for all-purpose white flour, coinciding with Americans channeling their energy into baking bread while stuck at home. Meanwhile, coffee prices increased by 8.64%, due to severe weather conditions hitting coffee producers Brazil and Colombia, which reduced the supply of the beans, compounded by supply chain snags, from lack of workers to port congestion. (Hover over or tap any of the lines in the chart below to see the price changes for specific items.)

Another item hit hard by inflation? Citrus fruit, which experienced an increase of 10.61% in January compared to a year ago. Again, the story is about more than just prices. Last month, the US Department of Agriculture forecast that Florida‚Äôs orange harvest would produce the smallest crop since 1945, as the state, which is US‚Äôs biggest orange producer, was hit hard by a bacterial infection called citrus greening disease. The disease is carried by the invasive insect Asian citrus psyllid, and spreads rapidly, resulting in citrus that becomes small, bitter, and never ripens. If Florida‚Äôs crops continue to shrink, high citrus fruit prices could be here to stay."

https://web.archive.org/web/20220205024527/https://bestlifeonline.com/renee-zellweger-fat-suit-pam-hupp-news/,"Ren√©e Zellweger's new TV show doesn't premiere for another month, but it's already facing backlash. On Feb. 3, the trailer for true crime series The Thing About Pam was released, leading to a lot of discussion about how ""unrecognizable"" Zellweger looks. The Oscar-winner is playing Pam Hupp, a convicted murderer who is currently serving a life sentence. For the role, Zellweger wears a fat suit, which caused backlash when photos from the set were published in October and has been rekindled with the released of the trailer.

Zellweger has spoken out about wearing prosthetics for the role but has not directly addressed the backlash. Read on to find out more about the criticism and to see what Zellweger had to say about taking on the role.

RELATED: HBO Fans Hate This Character‚ÄîAnd The Actor Is Fine With That.

The backlash began last fall.

After pictures came out of Zellweger filming the NBC series and a member of production carrying the fat suit on set, the backlash began. Explaining the issue, writer Sarah Alexander told Metro, ""For Zellweger to masquerade as a plus-size person is damaging, fatphobic and potentially triggering to other plus-size people. It seems like she has not considered the effects this will have on fat people, and is unaware and/or naive that she is adding to the stigma fat people already face on a daily basis."" Alexander added, ""Why were [larger actors] overlooked and a fat suit considered a viable option?""

Podcast host Rosey Blair told Cosmopolitan UK of the situation, ""There are so few roles available to actors in larger bodies it's truly insulting to see any successful working actor put on a costume to resemble the bodies Hollywood won't employ. There are so many juicy, nuanced roles available to thin actors‚Äîhow dare they take roles explicitly written as fat?""

The trailer brought on more criticism.

After the trailer was released on Thursday, people took to social media to call the show and its star out. For the most part, critics are arguing that an actor who actually matches the body type of the character should have been cast rather than having a thin actor wear a padded suit and prosthetics.

""It's 2022 and we're still putting people in fat suits instead of hiring fat actresses,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""I like Renee Zellweger, but why didn't they hire an actual overweight person for her new role? That was a good opportunity to bring a new talent in,"" said another. Someone else tweeted, ""how r fat ppl supposed to be cast in anything when they won't even cast us as fat characters.""

Zellweger has talked about her transformation.

While Zellweger has not made any comments about the backlash, she did speak to Vanity Fair about what went into playing the role.

""It was pretty much head to toe. It was prosthetics, it was a [padded] suit, it was the choice of clothing, it was the briskness in her step-step-step, her gait,"" Zellweger said. ""All of those things were really important because all those bits and pieces are what construct the person that we project our own conclusions and presumptions onto.""

The star said of people maybe not realizing it's her right away, ""Oh, gosh, if you don't recognize an actor or an actress in a performance, that's a great compliment. You're not trying to tell your own story.""

Other stars have faced backlash for wearing padded suits in roles.

Zellweger is not the only actor to receive backlash for this issue. For instance, just last year Sarah Paulson said she regretted wearing one when she played Linda Tripp in Impeachment: American Crime Story.

""I think the thing I think about the most is that I regret not thinking about it more fully,"" Paulson told the Los Angeles Times. ""And that is an important thing for me to think about and reflect on. I also know it's a privileged place to be sitting and thinking about it and reflecting on it, having already gotten to do it, and having had an opportunity that someone else didn't have ‚Ä¶ I wouldn't make the same choice going forward.""

Paulson also expressed her belief that the entire responsibility shouldn't fall onto the actor, who is focused on portraying more about the character than their physical appearance. ""I do think to imagine that the only thing any actor called upon to play this part would have to offer is their physical self is a real reduction of the offering the actor has to make,"" she said.

A Bad Day at the Valet

Like other theme parks, Universal Studios Orlando offers guests valet parking. Guests can access the valet service as a premium option.

However, today was a highly unusual day for one guest and the team at the Valet Lot in Universal Studios Orlando. Unfortunately, a car burst into flames as a guest went to use the valet lot.

Due to safety concerns, the team at Universal shut down valet parking access from the road. The fire must be controlled before more guests can safely enter the lot.

Additionally, security prevented guests from exiting to the lot. This likely caused some guests delays while trying to get from here to there. However, safety comes first and foremost.

What We Know So Far

It appears that only one vehicle was involved in the fire. The cause of the fire is unknown so far.

Fortunately, as far as we know, no one was injured in the incident! The team at Universal Studios Orlando should be commended for swift actions to keep theme park guests safe.

Duane Smith and his 11-year-old grandson, Allen Cadwalader, were out on a magnet fishing trip on January 30 in Homestead, a suburb of Miami, Florida, when within five minutes of their arrival, Cadwalader reeled in two sniper rifle receivers and bolt carrier groups wrapped in shrink wrap, Smith told CNN.

This was their first time magnet fishing, Smith said, and he chose a bridge with a canal near where he normally goes hiking.

Magnet fishing uses a strong magnet attached to a thick rope in an attempt to fish out metal objects that have sunk to the bottom of canals, lakes, ponds and rivers.

The double-sided five-pound magnet and rope that was used to reel in the two weapons in Florida.

It's a hobby Smith recently became interested in after watching several YouTube videos about the ins and outs. He figured this would be a more engaging activity for his grandson, who has autism, than traditional fishing.

I was 24 years old, and I loved browsing the internet for clothes that were both on-trend and affordable. Unfortunately, there weren't too many options back then. That's what gave me the idea to start a side hustle selling women's clothing on eBay. At first, it was just a fun hobby. Little did I know, 10 years later, my husband Chris and I would be running Pink Lily full-time. Last year, our online clothing business generated $141 million in gross sales. And today, our social media audience has grown to 3.6 million followers.

From an eBay side hustle to $141 million in sales

To start our eBay store, my husband Chris and I made an initial investment of about $300 to buy clothes and accessories from a wholesale website. Since I wasn't familiar with pricing strategies, I priced items at what I would pay as a customer. We worked out of our living room, so we didn't have much overhead to worry about except for shipping costs. Profits varied during the first few years, but we typically made anywhere from $300 to $1,000 per month. We used that money to pay off student loans and invest back into the business. I'd fly to Los Angeles to meet with vendors and place product orders, and eventually started attending trade shows to expand our line of selections.

Two years later, in 2013, I started a personal Facebook group to market my clothes. We had loyal customers who showed an increasing demand for our products, especially in our local community in Bowling Green, Kentucky. By the end of the year, we had saved around $20,000 from our profits, which we used to launch Pink Lily's official website. That's when business really began booming. In May 2014, we surpassed $100,000 in monthly revenue. After three years of running Pink Lily as a side hustle, I quit my insurance job to work on the business full-time. Chris joined me a few months later to oversee the company's finances and operations. We closed the year with more than $4 million in revenue. In 2019, after achieving $70 million in total sales, we received a minority stake investment to support the business' rapid growth. This helped us expand our product offerings and scale an amazing team. Currently, we sell more than 11,000 products on our site every day, have a brick-and-mortar store and, with 250 full-time employees, are one of the biggest employers in Bowling Green.

While we still visit trade shows, we now have a core group of vendor partners who we work with to create custom designs. Co-founding Pink Lily alongside my husband has been the journey of a lifetime. Here are my best tips for starting a successful business: 1. Find a gap in the market You've probably heard some version of this before, but I can't kick off entrepreneurial advice without hammering this point home: It's so important to find a gap in the existing market. When I started my side hustle, I saw an unmet need for fashion-inclined women who wanted to be able to find a dress for $50 or less. I knew I could help to fill that need in my own small way.

2. Reinvest your profits If you want growth to happen quickly, you need to reinvest all or most of your early profits back into the business. You may be very strapped for cash during the first few years. That was our experience, and it wasn't easy. We worked up to 60 hours per week, lived frugally, and reinvested the money we made back into growing Pink Lilly. 3. Find fun, unique ways to engage your social media followers Being active on social media has been a key part of our success. We regularly ask our 1.4 million Instagram followers what they'd like to see on our site and on our shelves. For example, we'll post photos of items we are considering purchasing or brands we could partner with for Pink Lily. Then we'll use everyone's responses and feedback to make any final decisions. This helps shoppers feel like insiders and part of the family.

But this week, he exchanged glitz and glamour for the staid procedures of a Village Council meeting.

Mr. Chappelle attended the three-hour virtual meeting on Monday to oppose a new housing development that had been set to include affordable housing. His appearance at the meeting has raised questions about why one of the most famous comedians in the world is involved with a small-town zoning battle.

What actually happened on Monday?

The Village Council held a meeting to allow residents to comment on an update to an existing plan for a housing development before the Council voted on the changes.

The revised plan would have included duplexes, townhouses and 1.75 acres of land reserved for affordable housing in a development that was originally going to include only 143 single-family homes, according to a memo from Brian Housh, the Village Council president."

The Dyson Laser Vacuum

The V15 Detect, unveiled last year, is the latest stick vacuum from Dyson. Getting started is simple: You charge the battery, attach a cleaning head to the stick and press a button.

The device comes with seven cleaning heads for sucking up dust and dirt on hardwood floors, carpets and smaller areas like crevices. The roller attachment for hardwood is the one with the laser. It makes night vacuuming a thing ‚Äî the darker it is, the more visible the laser. An attachment for carpet includes a cutter to slice up hair, which reduces the need to do maintenance on the head.

Stick vacuums have been popular because of their lightweight and cordless mobility, which makes cleaning less of a hassle than schlepping an upright corded vacuum around. Generally, though, the sticks have served as a secondary cleaner to a full-size vacuum because of their short battery life and relatively weak suction.

I can confirm that the stick vacuum has come a long way. The V15 Detect has a significantly more powerful motor, with stronger suction, than my Dyson V6 stick vacuum, which was released in 2015. Its battery lasted about 40 minutes before needing a charge, enough time to go through my modestly sized home. (My V6 lasted about 15 minutes.)

Lastly, the Dyson‚Äôs suction was not as strong as my extremely powerful Miele bagged vacuum. But after two weeks of vacuuming hardwood floors and carpets with the stick, I didn‚Äôt feel a need to plug in the full-size vacuum.

The Robots

It takes a while to get accustomed to the Roomba J7+, the $850 robot vacuum, and the Braava Jet M6, the $450 robot mop, both from iRobot. The devices rely on cameras, sensors and artificial intelligence to create a map of your home. Once a map is created, you can label each room and tell the robots to clean specific areas or to clean everywhere."

HAWAII Magazine readers Don and Rosie Eller wrote us with a question about how to visit one of Hawaii‚Äôs least visitable islands:

You mentioned in the story, ‚ÄúNot Quite Niihau,‚Äù from the November/December 2009 issue of HAWAII Magazine that you have visited the island of Kahoolawe. We wanted to know if it‚Äôs possible for us to visit the island.

You ask. We answer.

Yes, you can visit Kahoolawe. But you‚Äôre going to have to work for it.

The smallest of the eight main Hawaiian Islands, Kahoolawe and its surrounding waters are by law off-limits to the public. Your only way ashore is through volunteer work opportunities offered throughout the year.

Considered uninhabitable due to its diminutive size‚Äîa mere 44.6 square miles‚Äîand lack of fresh water, Kahoolawe became a training ground and bombing range for the U.S. military after World War II. In 1990, following decades of protest, these live-fire exercises ended. The military formally transferred control of Kahoolawe to the State of Hawaii in 1994.

In 1993, the Hawaii State Legislature established the Kahoolawe Island Reserve Commission (KIRC), ensuring the island and its surrounding waters would be preserved for future generations. The KIRC relies heavily on the efforts of volunteers to help with the restoration of the island. The group offers weekly work trips to Kahoolawe.

Volunteers meet on Maui on Monday morning, before being ferried over to Kahoolawe where they work from Monday through Thursday. There is a $100 fee that covers transportation from Maui to Kahoolawe, food and boarding costs.

What can you expect to be doing on the island with the KIRC?

‚ÄúLarge-scale restoration work,‚Äù says Mike Nahoopii, KIRC executive director. He explains that the duties vary, but this time of year workers keep busy planting native flora or removing invasive weeds‚Äîbasic, but crucial, work to reestablishing the island‚Äôs once-ravaged ecosystem. It‚Äôs not all work. Volunteers learn the history of Kahoolawe‚Äîboth ancient and contemporary‚Äîand practice Hawaiian chants and other cultural traditions.

KIRC‚Äôs base of operations is set up on the southern end of Kahoolawe and includes buildings with sleeping quarters, kitchen and a dining area. Modern amenities include toilets and electricity.

There is a wait list for the volunteer work trips, as KIRC takes only 20 to 25 volunteers to the island each week. When assigned to a work trip, volunteers are required to complete an orientation. The session informs volunteers of safety tips, environmental hazards and gives a cultural background of the area.

Click here to sign up for volunteer work. Or for specific inquiries, call (808) 243-5020, or email administrator@ kirc.hawaii.gov. You can read all about the KIRC‚Äôs history of restoration efforts by clicking here.

Nonprofit organization Protect Kahoolawe Ohana also offers a similar work trip through a stewardship agreement with KIRC. The trips happen monthly and are based on the north end of the island. As many as 60 volunteers can be accommodated on a single trip.

If you‚Äôre interested in volunteering with the PKO click here. For more information on the PKO‚Äôs restoration work on the island, click here.

Just remember, a stay on Kahoolawe isn‚Äôt a casual trip.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rough work,‚Äù says the KIRC‚Äôs Nahoopii. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the Hilton Hawaiian Village.‚Äù

We‚Äôre already midway through 2021 and still waiting for the book to come out! Will George R.R. Martin‚Äôs Winds of Winter be published shortly, and what can we hope from him?

Martin notified his admirers about a journey he went to the Midwest in the latest issue on his not-blog on July 16, 2021. He returned home in June, however, the post was delayed since there was a bunch of administrative work to be done. The author finished by repeating a well-known poem by Robert Frost:

‚ÄúThe woods were lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep and books to write before I sleep.‚Äù

Is this a reference to his pledge to deliver The Winds of Winter to his fans? After everything, this year might be too much to hope for, but perhaps one day.

George R.R. Martin released an update on Winds of Winter in April 2021. The sixth novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire book series has been postponed significantly, and George has given us even more bad news. Martin acknowledged in his most recent article on George R.R. Martin‚Äôs website Not A Blog that he will not be done with the book anytime shortly.

‚ÄúI am hugely behind right now, and the prospect of trying to catch up is increasingly oppressive‚Äù, Martin wrote.

It appears that the hope of a satisfactory conclusion to the series, along with the toll of Covid-19, has produced an environment unsuitable for finishing the book.

Since about June 2021, the 71-year-old writer has confessed that he desires the books had been published sooner than the Game of Thrones series.

Martin went on to tell fans that he is thrilled to have signed a five-year Game of Thrones contract with HBO and HBO Max for completely original material.

A Song of Ice and Fire was mentioned in a 2019 post. Author George R. R. Martin explicitly authorized his followers to lock him up in a cabin on White Island if he had not completed The Winds of Winter by July 2020, when WorldCon was scheduled to take place.

Despite the in-person event in New Zealand being canceled owing to the continuing epidemic, Martin, who had provided little sign of being closer to finishing the sixth book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, seemed to have avoided that destiny.

We had no idea that the jail he had playfully mentioned would turn out to be more than a hoax. Martin stated in another blog post written on June 23, 2020, that he is no new to the cabin fever that has afflicted many of us since March. In his situation, though, the first part of the phrase is extremely literal.

Could a Cabin Be All That Is Required for the Winds of Winter to Appear on Our Racks?

Several fans have ached for Wind of Winter upgrades throughout the years, asking why Martin is taking longer than expected to complete it. George R. R. Martin notified fans that he had been undergoing quarantine in a real cabin, which they could not have predicted a few months ago‚Ä¶ and it appears that something positive may have sprung from it.

While somewhat sick of living alone, the 71-year-old novelist noted that he maintains a regular, if somewhat monotonous, schedule and strives to remain fit. This appears to be now paying off.

Martin had much time to be spent with his characters now that most hassles had been gone and international travel had been replaced by Zoom calls.

As of June 2020, he was concentrating on Cersei and Tyrion Lannister, Ser Barristan Selmy, Asha Greyjoy (known as Yara in the HBO TV series), and Areo Hotah, the leader of the Martell guard. Arya Stark was also addressed, and she, as usual, aims to murder somebody.

Martin Teased the Release of Winds of Winter in 2021

While Martin has yet to regain his amazing writing rate from the late 1990s when he started on the series‚Äô third installment, A Storm of Swords, generating approximately 150 pages every month, fans can still rejoice.

The author expressed regret over his postponed trip to Wellington. Nonetheless, he stated his plan to return in 2021, when he thinks ‚Äúboth Covid-19 and The Winds of Winter will be completed.‚Äù

Rumors have lately flooded the internet, claiming that The Winds of Winter will be published in November 2023, as allegedly revealed by the writer. But, Martin‚Äôs website makes no mention of such a breach, and there is no authoritative source that does. If the author has made a public comment on a new release date, he should have done so discreetly.

Furthermore, even for well-known authors, predicting a thorough publication timeframe is difficult when the novel isn‚Äôt even near to completion. Edits will almost certainly be required after the manuscript is submitted. Only after the manuscript has been officially finalized can we start the countdown to the book‚Äôs arrival on our shelves."

https://web.archive.org/web/20220216070100/https://www.thestreet.com/investing/classic-las-vegas-area-casino-closed-likely-to-be-demolished,"Not every casino offers glitz and glamour, some offer grit and an old-school Las Vegas Strip feel.

The pandemic hurt the big casino players MGM Resorts International (MGM) - Get MGM Resorts International Report and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) - Get Caesars Entertainment Inc Report, but those companies had deep pockets and the ability to raise money or take on debt.

It wasn't easy seeing Las Vegas and really the entire state of Nevada shut down, but the giants of the field who dominate the iconic Las Vegas Strip had the resources to weather months of closures, over a year of pandemic-related rules, and convention cancellations, as well as a large percentage of Americans being reluctant to travel.

Las Vegas and Nevada aren't just home to the big casino names. For every Caesars Palace or MGM Grand, there are a couple of smaller, funkier properties that offer a different kind of charm, either in Las Vegas or elsewhere in the state.

At these casinos, which sometimes have legendary names and sometimes just ones that seem like they have history, you can still find 99-cent shrimp cocktail, $2 blackjack, and old-school slots instead of the new-fangled electronic one.

One of those half-iconic, half-ironic casinos -- Terrible's Hotel & Casino, located south of Las Vegas in Jean, Nevada -- closed due to the pandemic and some new report suggests it's unlikely it will reopen.

Image Source: Jett Gaming.

A Sad End to a Historic Casino

Terrible's Hotel & Casino used to operate as the Gold Strike, when it was an MGM property, according to Vegas Vantage. It was acquired when MGM bought the Mandalay Bay property before it was ultimately sold to JETT gaming in 2015.

Under MGM, the casino had an old-school feel that may have not been intentional.

""Gold Strike seemed like a dumping ground for old MGM machines during its ownership era. It was mostly coin games. Any game that did not dispense coins required a hand pay,"" the website reported.

The casino closed on March 17, 2020, and did not post anything new on its social media feeds until it posted an ominous post on Nov. 21, 2021 that suggested it would not be reopening.

""Terrible‚Äôs Hotel & Casino will not resume gaming operations for the foreseeable future. Players with active accounts on the day of closure (3/17/2020) will be able to redeem available slot points and Comp Dollars earned during the 18 months prior to closure at select Jett Gaming locations for 90 days following the date of 11/22/2021. Please visit our website at terriblescasinojean.com to learn more.""

Now, a new news report from the Las Vegas Review-Journal makes clear that the closure is permanent.

From a Kitschy Casino to a Warehouse?

""Reno developer Par Tolles‚Äô namesake firm has drawn up plans for a 1.9 million-square-foot warehouse and distribution complex along Interstate 15 in Jean, a remote outpost some 25 miles south of the Strip whose only residents are the inmates at a state prison,"" the paper reported.

The plans include the location that was once Terrible's Hotel and Casino. In the legal notice, the developer asked for zoning changes for both future warehouse development and a potential distribution center.

Clark County's commissioners were expected to consider the plan Feb. 16, but it seems likely to pass given the lack of options for the site.

""Tolles Development Co. is under contract to buy the sprawling project site and hopes to break ground on the first few buildings within the next 12 to 18 months,"" partner Cory Hunt told the Review-Journal.

This means a near-certain end for the casino that, while less than a famous property, was a unique part of the overall Nevada gaming scene. Jett Gaming owns a number of other casino properties, some of which are operating in limited capacities.

According to the Montreal-based trainer, the proven way to fall asleep in under two minutes is a two-step process which involves clearing one‚Äôs thoughts, and then picturing calm scenarios to help relieve the mind of additional stress, both of which Agustin claims serve to help properly shut down the body ahead of rest.

‚ÄúFirst, you need to calm your body and systematically relax and shut down each part of your body from head to toe, literally,‚Äù Agustin says.

In the viral Tik-Tok, Agustin gives two helpful examples to visualize: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying in a canoe on a calm lake with nothing but a clear blue sky above you‚Äù or, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying in a black velvet hammock in a pitch black room.‚Äù

As many experts in mindfulness assert, it‚Äôs natural for one‚Äôs mind to drift off while attempting to redirect one‚Äôs thoughts to the imagination or to the senses. The antidote, Agustin says, is to repeat the phrase ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think‚Äù for 10 seconds in order to help relax and focus on the breath.

This particular trick was developed by military fighter pilots and soldiers who found ways to sleep through distressing or uncomfortable war-time settings in order to avoid slow reflexes caused by sleep deprivation.

https://web.archive.org/web/20220204193952/https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-price-increase-3-days-to-avoid,"It's recently been confirmed that the cost of Amazon Prime would be increasing from $119 to $139 yearly, or from $12.99 to $14.99 monthly. This is the first price hike in around four years for Amazon, with changes going into effect from February 18 for new subscribers.

A lot of us probably don't want to pay any more than we currently are for Prime. Thankfully, there are already a few workarounds to check out. To give you a headstart, here's our top four ways on how to avoid the Amazon Prime price hike of 2022.

1. Sign Up to Amazon Prime Before February 18

Let's kick things off with an easy one. If you don't currently have an Amazon Prime account, but you do want Prime this year, make sure you sign up before the cut off date.

On February 18, 2022, all-new Amazon Prime users will have to pay $14.99/month or $139/year. Sign up before then for a 30-day free trial, and then a yearly membership, and you'll only have to pay $119, the going rate for the past four years. (This also works the same for those who pay monthly. Switch things up, and pay for a year of Prime now to save almost $60 over the course of the year.)

Sign Up Before Feb 18 Amazon Prime 30-day Free Trial + 1-Year Membership. 4 $119.00 See on Amazon

2. Gift Yourself 1-Year of Amazon Prime Right Now

Existing members will start to pay the new prices for Amazon Prime from March 25, 2022. If you are one of the millions currently paying for Amazon Prime in the US, there is a small hack you can do to pay just $119, instead of $139, for at least one more year.

This trick involves gifting yourself one year of Prime for $119 right now while the price is still locked in, and then cancelling your Prime membership before your auto-renewal date. Once your membership has fully expired, simply activate the gifted Prime membership and you're done, another year of Amazon Prime for $119. I've broken these steps down below as well, just to keep things as simple as possible.

Gift Yourself a Prime Membership for $119 now (see here) Set a reminder to cancel your Prime membership Manually cancel your membership a day before it expires (preventing auto-renewal) Important: Wait for your membership to end Redeem your ""gifted"" Prime membership

3. Join Amazon Prime Student

If you're a student, or maybe you've got a generous student living with you who will gracefully share their account, you can save even more on Amazon Prime, with Amazon Prime Student. (Requires .edu email address).

Costing just $59 per year, Prime Student comes with all the benefits of a Prime membership (free two-day shipping, Prime Video, etc), and even throws in a few extra incentives as well. New members can sign up for a 6-month free trial and will only have to pay $6.49/month, or $59/year after the trial expires.

Start Your Free 6-Month Trial New members get six months free. If you've used a free trial before, it's $6.49 per month, half the price of a normal Prime subscription. 5 Free See on Amazon

4. Cancel Amazon Prime Altogether

Rogue choice, I know. Do you need Amazon Prime? If yes, then see my three suggestions above. If no, just cancel it altogether and save $119/$139 a year. Sorted.

https://web.archive.org/web/20210620082405/https://www.purewow.com/wellness/is-subway-healthy,"You‚Äôve seen the commercials with Michael Phelps. You‚Äôve seen contestants on The Biggest Loser eating the sandwiches while on their journey to peak health. But the last time you popped in and saw the foot-long rolls, bacon and deli meats, you may have wondered, Is Subway actually healthy? The answer might surprise you.

Thanks to a commitment to quality and transparency, Subway absolutely can be healthy‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre conscious about how you order and your portion sizes, says nutritionist Lisa Young, Ph.D., author of Finally Full, Finally Slim. Subway lists on the nutrition section of its site that its sandwich ingredients don‚Äôt include any caramel coloring or partially hydrogenated oils and that it has partnered with Compassion in World Farming‚Äî‚Äúa widely recognized global leader in animal welfare‚Äù‚Äîto source its animal products and with local farmers who care about sustainability instead of pesticide use for its fruit and vegetables.

But this doesn‚Äôt mean your diet can‚Äôt go off the rails at the sandwich joint. Below, Young is helping us make the right choices the next time we‚Äôre craving Subway.

1. What should I skip at subway if I‚Äôm trying to eat healthy?

Ingredients to avoid: white bread, pepperoni, salami, roast beef, ham, American cheese, ranch dressing, mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, garlic aioli, bacon, wraps

Luckily, Subway is a chain with tons of options. While the white bread is packed with sodium (that‚Äôs the roasted garlic, ciabatta, Italian,Hearty Italian, Italian Herbs and Cheese, Ultimate Cheesy Garlic Bread and wraps), there are a few whole-wheat and whole-grain options that are much healthier substitutes. (Remember, though, that all the breads are high in carbs and you can forego them entirely if you want‚Äîwe‚Äôll get to that soon.)

Save the sodium and calories of the cured and red meats like pepperoni, salami, ham and bacon, Young suggests. If you want to cut back further, nix American cheese from your order‚Äîit contains 200 milligrams of sodium per serving.

Unfortunately, there‚Äôs not much you can do to make many of the sandwiches on the menu healthy‚ÄîRIP, Ultimate Spicy Italian (730 calories, 52 grams of fat, 1,720 milligrams of sodium), Turkey and Bacon Guacamole (800 calories, 30 grams of fat, 2,070 milligrams of sodium) and Ultimate Meatball Marinara (730 calories, 52 grams of fat, 1,530 milligrams of sodium). Oh, and just to be clear, we‚Äôre talking about six-inch subs, meaning these calorie-bomb totals are at least doubled for foot-longs. Whoa.

There are some sugary and calorie-packed sauces and dressings to avoid at Subway too. Skip the ranch, mayo and sweet onion sauce (it packs in a surprising 7 grams of sugar per serving).

Wraps that are cleverly named ‚Äútomato basil‚Äù or ‚Äúspinach‚Äù might trick you into thinking they‚Äôre healthy, but when you take a closer look, some of them are actually worse than the sandwiches, regardless of which vegetable-adjacent wrap you choose to swap in. The Chicken and Bacon Ranch Melt (the name of this guy doesn‚Äôt help its case) with the tomato basil wrap, for example? It contains a completely absurd 1,590 calories, 78 grams of fat (30 of which are saturated) and 3,930 milligrams of sodium. To put this into context, the American Heart Association recommends the average adult stay under 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, with the ideal target falling around 1,500 milligrams.

2. What should I get if I‚Äôm trying to eat healthy at subway?

Ingredients to order: salads (well, some of them), chicken, turkey, vegetables, multi- and whole-grain breads, artisan breads, red wine vinegar, Subway vinaigrette, honey mustard, chipotle Southwest sauce, guacamole, Swiss cheese

Sure, all of the breads are going to be carb-y, but some, like the 9-Grain Honey Oat (190 calories), 9-Grain Wheat (180 calories) and Artisan Flatbread (220 calories), and their adorable miniature versions, have 330 milligrams of sodium or less per loaf. Aside from the minis, you‚Äôll be hard-pressed to find a six-inch roll with less than 34 grams of carbs‚Äîand don‚Äôt even get us started on the foot-longs. But if you‚Äôre ordering a sandwich and making all the smart choices but you can‚Äôt just not have cheese, we hear you. Choose Swiss‚Äîthe least salty option on the menu.

To avoid the carbs of a sandwich (at least for the most part), skip down the menu to the salad section. The salads at Subway (yes, even the tuna with its mayo) are going to be your healthiest bet, Young says. But beware, a lot of the same rules for the sandwiches apply to the salads. The Spicy Italian Salad is loaded with meat and contains 23 grams of fat and 1,000 milligrams of sodium. The Southwest Chipotle Chicken Club has a whopping 860 calories (this is a salad), 56 grams of fat and 1,750 milligrams of sodium. The Steak Club Salad has 26 grams of fat and 1,970 milligrams of sodium (the meal highest in sodium on the whole menu besides some of the wraps and the Turkey and Bacon Guacamole Sandwich). Instead, opt for the 130-calorie Oven Roasted Chicken Salad, the 310-calorie tuna salad, 60-calorie Veggie Delight or the 110-calorie turkey breast salad. Choose a lighter dressing, too, like the 35-calorie Subway Vinaigrette.

Guac contains extra fat, but the fat from avocados is healthy, essential fat, so go ahead and order it if you‚Äôd like, Young adds. There‚Äôs an entire list of veggies to add to your sandwich or salad at Subway too, like banana peppers, black olives, pickles, bell peppers, tomatoes, red onions and cucumbers. Load up on the veggie menu and you won‚Äôt miss the salt-, fat- and calorie-heavy meat and bread you so wisely passed on.

3. When in doubt, order from Subway‚Äôs healthier menu

Subway tried to help us out by creating a Fresh Fit menu full of sandwiches it says are its healthiest options. This is pretty much true, but there‚Äôs no reason to have a white roll when you can sub it for a nine-grain, ham when you can have chicken, or roast beef when you can go veggie. Eat fresh out there, friends.

One of the best features of the iPhone 13 is MagSafe, which lets you magnetically clip on accessories like cases, wallets, and wireless chargers, but while rumors suggest it could come to more Apple gadgets like the iPad Pro (2022), it seems that the iPhone SE 3 might not get the feature.

This comes from Japanese publication Macotakara, which has previously provided accurate information about upcoming Apple products: apparently the new mid-range iPhone is going to have the same design as the iPhone SE (2020), and will have wireless charging but no MagSafe.

That's not the biggest surprise in the world, as Apple's SE devices typically don't get all the features of their pricier contemporaries, but it's also a shame as it sounds like the new iPhone SE won't have many upgrades over its predecessor.

Instead, it sounds like the one upgrade the next model will get over the 2020 one is 5G connectivity, which, depending on where you live in the world and what the 5G networks are like there, might not actually give you a noticeable boost.

Rumors suggest the iPhone SE 3 will come out at some point in 2022, two years after the last model, though there's no solid information from Apple to believe that's actually the case.

Leaks are pretty sporadic and contradictory at this point too, which either suggests that the next iPhone SE isn't actually coming out in the next few months, or that it's such a minor upgrade over its predecessor that there's nothing really new to report on.

Either way, we'll bring you all the legitimate or believable iPhone SE 3 information as it comes, so stay tuned for that."

And it's incredibly likely you know someone who caught COVID recently‚Äîvaccinated or not, there's also a good chance it wasn't pleasant. But who is most at risk of death? Startling new data presented by CDC Chief Rochelle Walensky sheds some light about just how at-risk those unvaccinated are. Read on for 5 life-saving pieces of insight‚Äîand to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had COVID.

1 Walensky Said ""Unvaccinated Individuals Were 97 Times More Likely to Die"" Compared to Those Boosted

Walensky showed data from 25 US jurisdiction that report cases and deaths linked to vaccination status‚Ä¶Vaccination and booster doses substantially decrease the risk of death from COVID-19. Looking at the data from the weekend, December 4th, the number of average weekly deaths for those who were unvaccinated was 9.7 per hundred thousand people, but only 0.7 per hundred thousand people for those who were vaccinated. This means the risk of dying from COVID-19 was 14 times higher for people who were unvaccinated compared to those who received only a primary series. For those who were boosted, the average of weekly deaths was 0.1 per 100,000 people‚Äîmeaning that unvaccinated individuals were 97 times more likely to die compared to those who were boosted.""

2 Walensky Showed Data Proving Boosters Work

Walensky also showed some ""new data from CDCs COVID net hospital surveillance network to further show how essential vaccination and boosting is in preventing hospitalization from COVID 19."" She showed data ""comparing the percentage of people, age 65 and older, who are unvaccinated and boosted in the general population‚Ä¶. And those who are hospitalized, only12% of those age 65 and over remain unvaccinated in the general population. But when we look at those over the age of 65, who are in the hospital for COVID-19, 54% are unvaccinated in stark contrast. Now let's look at those who have been boosted. 57% of those over age, 65 boosted in the general population and only 8% of those over the age of 65. And in the hospital for COVID-19 have received a booster dose. These same trends are seen across all age groups. These data show us that the percent of people who are currently hospitalized due to COVID 19 are disproportionately unvaccinated, and disproportionately not boosted. Additionally, these data confirm that vaccination and boosting continue to protect against severe illness and hospitalization.""

Walensky said: ""The current seven day daily average of cases is about 446,400 cases per day, a decrease of about 36% over the previous week. The seven day average of hospital admissions is about 17,100 per day, also a decrease of about 14% over the previous week. And the seven day average daily deaths are about 2,300 per day, which is an increase of about 4% over the prior week. While we continue to have large decreases, in average daily case counts across the country, hospitalizations remain high stretching our healthcare capacity and workforce to its limits in some areas of the country and daily deaths also remain quite high."" She wanted to ""reinforce the critical importance of vaccination.""

COVID patients are still strugggling with symptoms that may never go away. At the same briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the President and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked about any progress with Long COVID treatments. ""Yeah, there is a very large study that's been initiated some time ago, the RECOVER study, at the NIH and collaboration with other agencies, looking at the incidents, the prevalence, and hopefully understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of long COVID,"" he said. ""Right now, the data are starting to come in. It's too early to make any definitive statements, but for those individuals,‚Äîand as you know, long COVID means the persistence of signs and symptoms that are not explainable by any readily recognizable pathogenic process following the recovery from the acute infection‚Äîthere have been some suggestions that it is an aberrant inflammatory response, perhaps some element of auto-immunity, perhaps some element of persistence of nucleotide fragments from the virus. All of these now are being actively pursued, but before we can make any definitive statements, we need to learn a lot more about it, but the ultimate goal of figuring out how we might be able to mitigate or prevent some of the symptoms.""

""Even during the Omicron surge.

So follow the public health fundamentals and help end this pandemic, no matter where you live‚Äîget vaccinated or boosted ASAP; if you live in an area with low vaccination rates, wear an N95 face mask, don't travel, social distance, avoid large crowds, don't go indoors with people you're not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don't visit any of these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID."

In 2021, Nasa launched a feature allowing users to find the specific image capture on their birthday. Here‚Äôs how you can find the picture Nasa took on your birthday:

The Nasa birthday picture comes with some info written by an astronomer

It‚Äôs really easy. All you need to do is go on Nasa‚Äôs website and key in your birthday date. Then you‚Äôll see an image of the universe as well as some information about what the image is and why it was taken. This image, taken on July 7th 2010, was used by astronomers to map the distribution of dark matter in a cluster of galaxies.

How were the pictures taken?

All the pictures were taken by the Hubble Space Telescope which Nasa has been using to capture images like these since 1990.

The telescope orbits Earth around 15 times a day and is located 340 miles above Earth. Nasa estimates that the telescope covers five miles every second meaning. At that speed, you could cross the entire USA in around 10 minutes.

https://web.archive.org/web/20220217192625/https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/windows-11-unsupported-message-pc/,"If you‚Äôre running Windows 11 on an unsupported PC, then you might want to keep your eyes open for a new warning in the future. That‚Äôs because Microsoft is internally testing a new message in the Windows 11 Settings app to alert you that your system doesn‚Äôt meet the minimum requirements for the new operating system.

Twitter user and Windows leaker @thebookisclosed was the first to note this, but the good news is that it doesn‚Äôt look as though the messages might get in the way as much as the ‚ÄúWindows isn‚Äôt activated‚Äù warning and watermark might. Per the Twitter user, Microsoft‚Äôs latest preview builds just has an alert in the Windows 11 Settings app as a small ‚Äúhero‚Äù to indicate when system requirements are not met.

The alert shows up under the laptop name with a Learn More link. Clicking that link then sends you out to a Microsoft webpage that explains what happens when you install Windows 11 on devices that don‚Äôt meet minimum system requirements.

Again, this message only shows up in internal preview builds, so not everyone will be seeing it just yet, as Microsoft hasn‚Äôt rolled it out. And while it was always possible to run Windows 11 on unsupported hardware, doing so does have some risks. Microsoft doesn‚Äôt endorse it and warns of compatibility issues, as well as the fact that you won‚Äôt be entitled to receive future updates or new Windows features. This means you could be at risk for security issues like malware, spyware, and other common Windows problems.

Of course, we recently found that you might still get updates, after all, but if your system doesn‚Äôt meet the requirements for Windows 11, you might want to consider buying a new one. Or, you can try to upgrade your device‚Äôs components like the CPU or the TPM 2.0 chip just to be safe. Microsoft still has the right to stop delivering updates to your device at any time.

Windows 11 is only compatible on systems with Intel 8th-generation processors or newer processors, or AMD Ryzen 2000 series processors. This has been the main roadblock and a source of controversy for many people, along with the mandatory requirement for a TPM 2.0 chip. However, Windows 11 is still gaining steam and hit a 16.1% market share in January, per the firm AdDuplex.

Better Call Saul fans proved that this week, deciphering the premiere date for the AMC drama‚Äôs sixth and final season before it was officially announced.

Season 6 will debut Monday, April 18 at 9/8c, just about two years after it last aired, AMC confirmed on Thursday at the Television Critics Association winter press tour. But eagle-eyed viewers already guessed the date, based on a clue in a teaser for the new season released on Monday. In the teaser, the Cousins walk through a crime scene where a worker has laid out evidence tags that read ‚ÄúD‚Äù and ‚ÄúR.‚Äù D is the fourth letter in the alphabet, and April is the fourth month of the year, while R is the 18th letter in the alphabet. Hence: April 18!

AMC has also confirmed that the final 13 episodes will roll out in two parts, with the first seven episodes beginning in April and culminating with the series‚Äô final six episodes beginning Monday, July 11.

In case you forgot where we left off: Jimmy and Kim hatched a plan to frame their nemesis Howard for a crime so the Sandpiper lawsuit would have to be settled and Jimmy would get a $2 million cut of the settlement, and Gus and Nacho conspired to assassinate Lalo, only Lalo survived the ambush ‚Äî and now he knows Nacho tried to have him killed. (Uh-oh.)

https://web.archive.org/web/20220210131414/https://www.themanual.com/culture/super-bowl-halftime-show/,"The Super Bowl is days away, which means we‚Äôre about to be treated to a one-two punch of football and halftime entertainment. Often as good or better than the game itself, the halftime performance is a spectacle all its own. And this year, the lineup will likely bring the house down.

Super Bowl XLI will feature Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, Dr. Dre, Eminem, and Tha Doggfather himself, Snoop Dogg. It‚Äôs a fitting lineup that tips a hat to the L.A. hip-hop scene and it will almost certainly play from the incredible record 2001, originally released in 1999.

This year‚Äôs bill is an interesting mix of rap and R&B royalty. It‚Äôs not too much of a surprise that Snoop would perform, as he‚Äôs been busy in the limelight lately, hocking everything from Corona to his own brand of wine. Kendrick Lamar has been more secretive and it should be pretty special to see him share the stage with his esteemed predecessors. As arguably the best rapper on the planet right now (with a Pulitzer to prove as much), Lamar will more than likely offer some lyrical poetry, not to mention some relatively young energy.

What will the crew do with their precious set time? We‚Äôll have to wait and see, but with this much talent on stage, it‚Äôs likely to be a memorable 12 or so minutes. It‚Äôll be a first if nothing else. While Dr. Dre and Snoop have performed together countless times, this year‚Äôs halftime show will mark the first time these five stars shared the stage simultaneously. We expect some classic snip-its of tracks like Forgot About Dre peppered with shout-outs to the city of angels and the birthplace of west coast rap. An amazing 44 Grammies have been earned by the collective over the years.

It‚Äôs a lauded club to join. The Super Bowl halftime performance has featured everybody from Prince to U2 to The Weeknd. It can involve everything from fireworks and massive choreographed dance routines to infamous wardrobe malfunctions. And while we‚Äôre still dealing with a pandemic that rocked every industry out there, from agriculture to music, it‚Äôll be nice to see a live show again, even if only on television from the comfort of our favorite couch cushion.

Touring has all but stopped over the last couple of years (although it‚Äôs picking up again), but the artists have still kept busy and won‚Äôt be showing any signs of rust on stage. Dr. Dre has been working closely with Snoop and Eminem and released a half-dozen new tracks at the end of last year. Blige is hot off of a new documentary about her Yonkers upbringing as well as a continued role in the second season of Power II: Ghost. Lamar has been teasing a new album for months and we‚Äôre eager to get a taste. Given just how connected these performers are, there‚Äôs a decent chance we‚Äôll get a surprise drop-in from somebody like Anderson .Paak, Busta Rhymes, or SZA.

Sure, most of these cats are going on 50 at this point, but they are aging gracefully. The sheer level of talent on stage will be impressive. And who knows, maybe we‚Äôll even witness some of them getting stage fright for the first time in their lives. Last year‚Äôs game attracted some 96.4 million sets of eyes, quite the audience to say the very least.

Be sure you‚Äôre all set for the football-related festivities, whether it‚Äôs the right appetizers or a friendly wager. Even if you don‚Äôt care much about the Bengals or the Rams, the commercials and halftime performance alone are worth checking in on.

Square hamburgers belong to Wendy's (WEN) - Get Wendy's Company Report.

The company has used that shape as a way to set its hamburgers apart from its rivals to show that it used fresh, never frozen ground beef sourced locally. Wendy's burger patties are square to metaphorically show that the company doesn't cut corners but they have been built on a promise set by company founder Dave Thomas.

""When Dave Thomas founded Wendy‚Äôs he set out to create a great-tasting hamburger, one that he wasn‚Äôt getting at any other restaurant chain. As he created the business plan and menu, he knew his delicious hamburger would need to be made with fresh beef and only fresh beef. And you know what; they actually hand-pattied the beef in-restaurant back in the day,"" Wendy's Senio Vice President Dave Hecker told the company's Square Deal blog back in 2016.

The company has kept the iconic shape and. despite having grown from a handful of restaurants to thousands, it has continued to use fresh, never frozen beef. Now, McDonald's (MCD) - Get McDonald's Corporation Report has decided to copy its rival's signature look for two new hamburgers (albeit without copying the fresh, never frozen beef.

What's a McDonald's New York Burger?

To taste the chain's new square hamburgers, you'll have to take a trip to one of the McDonald's in Japan. That's where these Wendy's-like offerings will hit the menu for a limited time.

Designed to give McDonald's Japan visitors a taste of New York, the ""Itta Ki Ni Naru N.Y. Burgers"" come in square shapes and paper-style packaging inspired by American comic books. The name means ""I Feel Like I Went to N.Y. Burgers.""

First reported by the Tokyo-based news outlet SoraNews24, the new offering includes the Thick Beef Burger Pepper & Cheese (a beef burger with bacon, lettuce, and smoked cheddar) and Grilled Chicken Burger Salt & Lemon (a chicken burger with bacon, salad, onions, and a lemon-garlic sauce). It is a temporary promotion and will be available at McDonald's Japan locations from February 9 to mid-March.

Both burgers will have the square meat and bun shape that is so different from the round one Americans associate with the iconic McDonald's cheeseburger.

McDonald's Varies Its Menu Around the World

Known for tailoring its menus to local tastes, McDonald's restaurants offerings can vary vastly in different countries. McDonald's India has a wide selection of vegetarian options like the McAloo Tikki Burger and the Paneer Wrap while McDonald's Philippines has McSpaghetti with tomato sauce and a side of fried chicken.

Modeled after a somewhat romanticized image of what New York is like, the ""I Feel Like I Went to N.Y. Burgers"" will also be advertised to Japanese viewers through an ad campaign and commercial set to ""Ghostbusters"" theme music.

Along with Restaurant Brands International (QSR) - Get Restaurant Brands International Inc Report-owned Burger King, Wendy's and McDonald's are the three biggest burger chains in the United States. While McDonald's and Wendy's saw in-person traffic to their stores rise by a respective 1.1% and 3.8% following the pandemic, Burger King visits are still down 6.8%, from 2019.

While the three chains are constantly trying to outdo each other with different offerings and options, American McDonald's is known for having the most stable and unchanging menu. While Burger King launched a veggie burger in 2016, the chain behind the iconic Golden Arches is only now testing the McPlant in select US markets.

But as Wendy's square burgers have become its signature feature for American eaters (the fast-food chain claims its founder Dave Thomas invented the square burger), it's easy to see why a product like the ""I Feel Like I Went to N.Y. Burgers"" is limited to menus outside the U.S."

Jeopardy! traveled back to primetime recently with the premiere of Jeopardy! National College Championship, and actress Mayim Bialik tagged back in for game show icon Ken Jennings to resume hosting duties. It seems the Jeopardy! team wanted to have a bit of fun with that return, as one of the clues made a sneaky but great reference to Bialik‚Äôs former hit sitcom , The Big Bang Theory.

The moment came at the start of the second round of gameplay. The categories appeared on the screen, and one of them was a somewhat obscure reference to The Big Bang Theory. Check out the category below, and continue on for the explanation for anyone not in the loop.

(Image credit: Jeopardy!)

For anyone scratching their head right now, ‚ÄúFun With Flags‚Äù is a deep-cut reference to Sheldon's web show in The Big Bang Theory. In the CBS comedy, Sheldon originally started Fun With Flags as his own web series to teach vexillology, or the study of flags. Down the stretch, Sheldon eventually added Amy to the project, and the two hosted the series together. Amy was, of course, played by Mayim Bialik, which brought the reference full-circle during Jeopardy! National College Championship.

Unfortunately, unless audiences watching were big fans of The Big Bang Theory, the moment likely went unnoticed. Mayim Bialik either didn‚Äôt catch the reference while hosting the tournament or just wanted to maintain a professional attitude while in Jeopardy! mode. It is worth noting, however, that Bialik was a bit quirky throughout the evening and even briefly sang DJ Snake and Lil Jon‚Äôs hit song ‚ÄúTurn Down For What‚Äù during the episode.

The Jeopardy! National College Championship wasn‚Äôt devoid of silliness and fun, so I do wonder why more wasn‚Äôt done to reference the category from The Big Bang Theory. For example, what if the entire category featured Jim Parsons in character asking questions about the various flags of the world? That would be a big primetime moment (even if not particularly likely), and a perfect opportunity to generate some positive buzz for Mayim Bialik‚Äôs time on the show. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to see a clip of this in between questions?

Mayim Bialik is currently sharing Jeopardy! hosting duties with Ken Jennings, and it‚Äôs unclear at this time if she‚Äôll get the permanent hosting gig. While Bialik had a positive reception at first and seems happy to be doing it , there were those with the show who expressed concern about her dual television filming schedule on Call Me Kat, and past rumors alleged she‚Äôs difficult to work with . Time will tell if she‚Äôll eventually take on the mantle for good, and if more references from The Big Bang Theory are on the way."

Teen Wolf's Best & Worst Couples

Per the streamer, returning vets include Tyler Posey (Scott McCall), Holland Roden (Lydia Martin), Shelley Hennig (Malia), Crystal Reed (Allison Argent), Orny Adams (Coach Bobby Finstock), Linden Ashby (Sheriff Noah Stilinski), JR Bourne (Chris Argent), Seth Gilliam (Dr. Alan Deaton), Colton Haynes (Jackson Whittemore), Ryan Kelley (Deputy Jordan Parrish), Melissa Ponzio (Melissa McCall) and Dylan Sprayberry (Liam Dunbar).

Notable cast members missing from the list Dylan O‚ÄôBrien (Stiles), Superman and Lois‚Äò Tyler Hoechlin (Derek) and Arden Cho (Kira). Paramount+, however, hints that ‚Äúadditional‚Äù names will be announced in the coming weeks/months.

In Teen Wolf: The Movie, which will be written by franchise creator Jeff Davis,‚Äùa full moon rises in Beacon Hills, and with it a terrifying evil has emerged. The wolves are howling once again, calling for the return of banshees, werecoyotes, hellhounds, kitsunes, and every other shapeshifter in the night. But only a werewolf like Scott McCall (Posey), no longer a teenager yet still an alpha, can gather both new allies and reunite trusted friends to fight back against what could be the most powerful and deadliest enemy they‚Äôve ever faced.‚Äù

TVLine asked Davis about the reunion rumors at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2017, two months before the series finale aired. Here‚Äôs what he told us then: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been having [discussions] with MTV. There‚Äôs a new regime there, headed by Chris McCarthy, who‚Äôs fantastic and has a real vision of how to reestablish the MTV brand. He‚Äôs got a great love for Teen Wolf, so he and I have been talking about doing a podcast, something along the lines of S-Town or Serial or even Homecoming. [It‚Äôs our way of] keeping the franchise going. It‚Äôs just talk now, just the possibility of a reboot. But it seems like if they‚Äôd be into it, we could do a little bit of re-invention.‚Äù

McCarthy later told THR, ‚ÄúWe are talking with Jeff about how do we actually keep that franchise alive. And the beauty of the evolution of media is you can see ‚Ä¶ a resurrection of a new class in a couple years.‚Äù

Teen Wolf aired for six seasons on MTV (2011‚Äì2017). Teen Wolf: The Movie will premiere on Paramount+ later this year."

http://web.archive.org/web/20220203194559/https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/richard-branson-diet-health-tips.html,"If I asked you to close your eyes and picture Richard Branson, what image would come to mind? You might think of him strapped into a Virgin Galactic rocket shooting into space, or performing some wild publicity stunt like trying to fly a hot air balloon around the world. Perhaps you'd picture him kitesurfing with some celebrity on his private Caribbean island.

Whatever came to mind, I'm going to guess it was active and daring. Now I have another question for you: How old exactly is Sir Richard these days? Don't Google it: He's 71.

Take those two paragraphs and put them together and what do you get? A septuagenarian grandfather who, far from being creaky and forgetful, appears to be maintaining incredible levels of energy and fitness. Which is why I didn't click away when I visited Branson's blog recently and saw a post on how he eats for greater health. Entrepreneurs in general may not be the best sources of nutrition advice, but Branson seems like a guy who knows something about aging well.

Meet Richard Branson's diet guru.

The specific disease-fighting diet Branson follows was designed by Harvard-trained cancer doctor William Li, who argues that certain superfoods help the body ward off diseases like cancer and heart disease. Li recently spoke at a Virgin Unite gathering, and Branson reports being inspired by his work to improve his own diet.

""I have long prioritized an all-round healthy lifestyle. I exercise daily in the form of tennis, kitesurfing, swimming, weights, and cycling (sometimes to my detriment!). I go to bed at 9 p.m. when possible, I have an incredible team around me to help manage stress and am blessed with the most incredible friends and family. And diet, according to Dr. Li, is the final pillar to help realize full health potential,"" Branson writes.

Happily, many of the foods recommended by Li are ones you likely already enjoy. Branson apparently indulges in three every day.

""Dr. Li argues that drinking one to three cups of coffee a day lowers the risk of heart failure by 33 percent. And that by eating one kiwi fruit a day you can increase protection of your DNA from oxidative damage by 60 percent,"" Branson reports. ""He also suggests that by sipping five cups per day of green tea you can significantly lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.""

If that sounds intriguing to you, you can pick up Li's book Eat to Beat Disease for lots more information, but here to get you started is a sampling of other foods Li claims help prevent disease. Eating all of them every day is a tall order, but regularly adding as many as you can to your diet should help you stay healthy and avoid disease.

Coffee for disease-fighting flavanols Green tea for polyphenols like EGCG Mango Fresh berries Kiwi fruit for vitamin C and antioxidants Oatmeal Sourdough bread for its effect on the microbiome Hard cheeses such as Gouda, Muenster, and Camembert for vitamin K2 Leafy greens like kale, spinach, arugula, and radicchio Legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and beans for protein, fiber, iron, and vitamins and minerals Small tinned fish like sardines, mackerel, and anchovies for omega-3 fatty acids Tomato sauce for the antioxidant lycopene Extra virgin olive oil Walnuts for omega-3 fats, B vitamins, and magnesium Dark chocolate"
http://web.archive.org/web/20220220072220/https://www.workandmoney.com/s/family-movies-aged-485054d74e5f4a7b,"Family Movies That Haven't Aged Well Think twice before sharing some of these cinematic blunders from your childhood with your kids.

Family Movies That Haven't Aged Well It‚Äôs movie night, and the kids have bestowed upon you the onerous task of picking something out. You wonder if you can stomach ‚ÄúToy Story 3‚Äù for the 13th time before you have what, at first, seems like a moment of clarity as you suggest watching one of your favorite films from childhood. But before you know it, you‚Äôre cursing yourself as you watch the horror unfold before the very eyes of your suddenly curious children. They start asking questions, sparking the very conversations that make you feel awkward and unfit to raise a child. All of this because you thought a movie starring John Travolta was hilarious when you were 8 years old. A word to the wise: Next time this scenario has any chance of becoming reality, remember these family movies and avoid them like the plague.

Free Willy Released: 1993 Box office: $153.7 million ($267 million today) Rated: PG Note: In compiling this list, we used Box Office Mojo, unless otherwise noted, for the gross domestic and international box office totals. And where applicable, we adjusted this figure for inflation to show its value today.

Bottom Line: Free Willy Anyone who‚Äôs seen the documentary ‚ÄúBlackfish‚Äù knows where we‚Äôre going with ‚ÄúFree Willy.‚Äù For those who haven‚Äôt, ‚ÄúBlackfish‚Äù makes a rather convincing case that orcas should never under any circumstances be held in captivity. At its core, ‚ÄúFree Willy‚Äù has good intentions. A boy who vandalized an amusement park is made to work there to repay his debts, and he forms a strong attachment to one of its residents: Willy, the orca. Their bond is so strong in fact that the boy decides what‚Äôs best for the whale is to be freed from captivity to rejoin its family. First off, Willy ends up freeing himself in stunning yet unrealistic fashion by leaping over a barrier at the amusement park. This is simply infeasible, wildly dangerous for both child and animal, and thus the entirely wrong message to send to children, who are the only audience for this movie. Second, it‚Äôs just not that easy ‚Äî the orca can‚Äôt simply return to the wild, and everything will be hunky dory. That became abundantly clear when the real Willy was actually set free and died a horrible death as a result. It‚Äôs best if this movie ‚Äî and the two that followed it ‚Äî find the bottom of history‚Äôs dustbin and stay there.

Polly Tix in Washington Released: 1933 Box office: N/A (shorts such as this played before main attractions) Rated: N/A

Bottom Line: Polly Tix in Washington We‚Äôre going to kick things off with an uncomfortable story about America‚Äôs first true sweetheart: Shirley Temple. With films like ‚ÄúBright Eyes,‚Äù ‚ÄúCurly Top‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeidi,‚Äù she was already an international sensation by the ripe old age of five. But before those children‚Äôs classics, she took part in a series of one-reel shorts as a 3-year-old called ‚ÄúBaby Burlesks‚Äù that at the time were intended to be satirical but are just plain creepy. And in some cases, as Time magazine points out, they were even more offensive than ‚ÄúToddlers in Tiaras.‚Äù Take ‚ÄúPolly Tix in Washington.‚Äù Temple appears at about 2 minutes and 50 seconds as a woman paid to seduce a lawmaker ‚Äî at 3 years old. We‚Äôre not sure how that‚Äôs supposed to be funny in 1932, 2002, 2082 or 2502. Slate wrote that the films used sexuality to drive the jokes and were blatantly racist. Yes, yes they were.

Look Who‚Äôs Talking Released: 1989 Box office: $297 million ($601.4 million today) Rated: PG-13

Bottom Line: Look Who‚Äôs Talking This movie somehow achieved a PG-13 rating, even though it stars John Travolta and a baby who hallucinates off Demerol. It also made oodles of money and spawned a three-part franchise. The plot alone is a case study for the #MeToo movement: older, wealthy married man gets his CPA pregnant, claims he‚Äôll leave his wife for her but obviously doesn‚Äôt follow through. Then, mom meets a cabbie while in labor. They become friends. He wants more, but she wants a successful man because that really worked out the first time. Eventually, they fall in love so Hollywood can tie a really pretty bow around this rather terrible movie. One of the overriding themes of the movie is that women can‚Äôt possibly raise a child without John Travolta around, which meant this was destined to age poorly. Another theme is that you can have an extramarital affair that leads to a baby, and you will be responsible for absolutely nothing. And let‚Äôs not forget a vulgar Bruce Willis voicing baby Mikey and a horribly racist scene involving an Indian baby.

Song of the South Released: 1946 Box office: $63.7 million (IMBD) ($820.2 million today) Rated: G

Bottom Line: Song of the South Unpacking this abomination could fill a master‚Äôs thesis, so we‚Äôll just focus on the song for now. You know it well. ‚ÄúZip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay / My, oh, my, what a wonderful day / Plenty of sunshine headin' my way / Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay!‚Äù But you might not know that it was from ‚ÄúSong of the South.‚Äù And that‚Äôs because Disney wants you to forget about this racist, trope-filled disaster released in 1946 and somehow re-released in the ‚Äô80s due to a major glitch in the matrix. Worse, however, is that Disney still capitalizes on parts of it. Slate points out that the song is synonymous with Disney itself, and the characters still exist on Splash Mountain rides at its theme parks. And in his book ‚ÄúDisney‚Äôs Most Notorious Film,‚Äù author Jason Sperb writes that the film is ‚Äúone of Hollywood‚Äôs most resiliently offensive racist texts.‚Äù What is perhaps most astonishing about ‚ÄúSong of the South‚Äù is that, according to the Slate article, Disney took pains to try to make the movie less racist, even inviting NAACP President Walter White to California to oversee script revisions (though that meeting never occurred and probably should have).

The Flintstones Released: 1994 Box office: $341.6 million ($578.8 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: The Flintstones We can‚Äôt imagine what ‚ÄúThe Simpsons‚Äù would be like with a live-action Bart and Lisa, and that‚Äôs because we‚Äôve spent our entire lives praying to any god who would listen for that nightmare not to come true. Sadly, Hanna-Barbera did not feel the same way about its signature animated family. The human movie version of ‚ÄúThe Flintstones‚Äù packed an all-star cast, and people gobbled it up to the tune of hundreds of millions in worldwide box office earnings. The problem is, the movie was just really bad. Roger Ebert summed it up well in his 1994 review: ‚Äú[T]he story is confusing, not very funny and kind of odd, given the target audience of younger children and their families. Do kids really care much about office politics, embezzlement, marital problems, difficulties with adoption, aptitude exams and mothers-in-law?‚Äù

Peter Pan Released: 1953 Box office: $87.4 million ($822 million today) Rated: G

Bottom Line: Peter Pan This movie is flat-out embarrassing with all-caps and hyphens between the letters. We‚Äôll focus on the Native American stereotypes. Smithsonian magazine writes that there‚Äôs ‚Äúno real reason for a tribe of Native Americans ‚Ä¶ to live on Neverland, where they are impossible to excise from the story. But it's almost as impossible to depict them in a way that's not offensive.‚Äù The magazine also points out that many other children‚Äôs stories were altered after publication when offensive parts faced backlash, but J.M. Barrie‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeter Pan‚Äù never faced that kind of scrutiny or revision. In addition to the sentence structure that makes these characters‚Äô dialogue offensive, there is the wildly inappropriate song ‚ÄúWhat Makes the Red Man Red?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat made the red man red? / Let's go back a million years / To the very first Injun prince / He kissed a maid and start to blush / And we've all been blushin' since‚Äù OMG. Despite Smithsonian magazine‚Äôs assertion, later versions of the story, like the 1991 Robert Zemeckis movie ‚ÄúHook,‚Äù did away with the Native American elements entirely. But the original Disney movie is a reminder of the painful power of racial stereotypes.

Ernest Goes to Africa Released: 1997 Box office: N/A (straight to video) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: Ernest Goes to Africa One could easily make a case for any of the movies in the Ernest franchise being included among this list, but ‚ÄúGoes to Africa‚Äù wins out because of its unbridled racism. Take it from Uproxx, which wrote, ‚ÄúThe relatively gentle racism of ‚ÄòGoes to Camp‚Äô and ‚ÄòSlam Dunk‚Äô was just a warm-up for this deeply embarrassing meltdown.‚Äù (And the author of that article actually likes Ernest movies.) Let‚Äôs recap some of the choice moments: Ernest goes to an Indian palace, in Africa, and calls people ‚Äúsahib.‚Äù A white actor darkens his face to play an Indian character. An African tribe is depicted as cannibals. African dialects are presented as mere gibberish. Japanese ninja weapons are somehow commonplace in Africa. Need we go on?

Space Jam Released: 1996 Box office: $230.4 million ($368.7 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: Space Jam Many people think this is a good movie. And that‚Äôs why it reappears in theaters sometimes, ala ‚ÄúThe Big Lewbowski.‚Äù But where that Coen brothers classic succeeds in its quirkiness and memorable lines, ‚ÄúSpace Jam‚Äù is merely a vehicle for financial gain that exploits a legendary basketball player named Michael Jordan, a bunch of famous actors and one of the most beloved children‚Äôs empires in history: the Looney Tunes. And now it‚Äôs getting a reboot starring LeBron James and helmed by Ryan Coogler. Here‚Äôs what The A.V. Club has to say: ‚ÄúWhen it launched in 1996, anyone over the age of 12 could see ‚ÄòSpace Jam‚Äô for the capitalist perversion of the Looney Tunes franchise it was, the filmic equivalent of tees depicting ‚Äúhip-hop‚Äù Bugs in backwards jeans. Still, the movie seared itself into unblemished brains with a Taz-shaped brand, resulting in a rippling wave of modern-day nostalgia that‚Äôs birthed a Lebron James‚Äìstarring sequel, live readings and encore runs in theaters across the country.‚Äù There‚Äôs also the female cartoon bunny character, Lola, who looks like she stepped out of an adult cosplay convention. And the movie‚Äôs quintessential song is ‚ÄúI Believe I Can Fly‚Äù by none other than the wholesome family man, R. Kelly.

The Cat in the Hat Released: 2003 Box office: $134 million ($182.8 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: The Cat in the Hat This movie was wildly popular the year it was released, although we‚Äôll bet most of those who paid to see it felt bilked. However, it‚Äôs easy to see how anyone could‚Äôve been fooled. The filmmakers were working with phenomenal source material from the Dr. Seuss classic, and Mike Myers is usually affable and easy to digest. But this movie was bad when it debuted, and somehow it‚Äôs worse today. We love what The Guardian did here by compiling memorable bits of reviews of the movie: ‚ÄúAn abomination, impure and simple.‚Äù ‚Äî Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal ‚ÄúLike being run over by a garbage truck that backs up and dumps its load on top of you.‚Äù ‚Äî David Edelstein, Slate ‚ÄúThey might as well have skipped the hassle of securing licensing rights and simply called this mess, 'Mike Myers: Asshole in Fur.'‚Äù ‚Äî Gregory Weinkauf, Dallas Observer ‚ÄúTake someone you hate ... Perhaps the worst holiday movie ever made.‚Äù ‚Äî John Anderson, Newsday

Dumbo Released: 1941 Box office: $1.6 million (IMDB) ($27.3 million today) Rated: G

Bottom Line: Dumbo On the surface, ‚ÄúDumbo‚Äù is a warm-hearted story about perseverance in the face of incessant bullying and the special bond between mother and child. But dig deeper, even just a few inches, and this Disney ‚Äúclassic‚Äù is full of cringe-inducing racism that by any generation‚Äôs standards should‚Äôve been more heavily scrutinized. Let‚Äôs start with the crows. As Complex notes, ‚ÄúJive-talking black crows, smoking while singing, ‚ÄòI‚Äôd be done see‚Äôn about everything, when I see an elephant fly‚Äô is already super offensive. Except it gets worse. The main crow‚Äôs name is Jim Crow, hilariously named after the racial segregation laws. Additionally, the [voice] actors are all white men putting on their best black man voice.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the ‚ÄúSong of the Roustabouts,‚Äù which Decider highlights as the most racist thing about the original ‚ÄúDumbo.‚Äù Just have a look at these lyrics. There‚Äôs also the scene where Dumbo gets so wasted that he trips out in nightmarish fashion, and throughout the film, the circus animals are treated like garbage purely for the sake of human entertainment. ‚ÄúDumbo‚Äù underwent a live-action reboot that debuted in March 2019, and thanks to the storytelling of Tim Burton, handles the balance of good and evil much better.

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Released: 1964 Box office: N/A (made for TV and rerun every year) Rated: G

Bottom Line: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer It‚Äôs the most beloved Christmas movie out there, but it‚Äôs also an example of how easy it is to dismiss someone simply because they are different. ‚ÄúRudolph‚Äù is as much a movie about bullying as it is about redemption. And this bullying was vaulted into the spotlight just this past holiday season thanks to The Huffington Post. Yet, surprisingly, in the face of ample evidence, many folks simply did not understand how HuffPo could draw such a conclusion. While this story has plenty of similarities with another moment of reckoning for a beloved holiday classic, albeit a song, the ‚ÄúRudolph‚Äù criticism seems more clear-cut. It‚Äôs simply not a good lesson in acceptance when Donner, Rudolph‚Äôs father, tries to cover up his son‚Äôs red nose because Donner‚Äôs embarrassed by this unique trait. When the coach tells the other reindeer to not let Rudolph play in any games, that‚Äôs exactly the opposite of what an authority figure should do. And when Hermey, the elf, expresses a desire to follow his dreams of becoming a dentist instead of being forced to make toys his entire life, he is not celebrated and encouraged but rather mocked and ridiculed. Of course, the movie has a happy ending with Rudolph saving Christmas, but the journey to get there is fraught with moral peril.

Problem Child Released: 1990 Box office: $72.2 million ($138.7 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: Problem Child And that brings us to ‚ÄúProblem Child,‚Äù which at its best is simply offensive to the art of filmmaking. It was also so rife with issues, according to Mental Floss, that it‚Äôs a wonder it ever made it to theaters. For one thing, it was supposed to be a dark comedy for adults but tested so poorly that it was revamped into a family movie. Then, it became so popular that the producers made TWO more ‚ÄúProblem Child‚Äù movies. To understand the depth of horrible that is ‚ÄúProblem Child,‚Äù consider that John Ritter couldn‚Äôt even save this disaster, and he‚Äôs the guy who successfully played the randiest heterosexual gay man in television history for eight seasons of ‚ÄúThree‚Äôs Company.‚Äù But that‚Äôs what happens when you try to find humor in the story of a child who is considered so ‚Äúawful‚Äù that his biological parents abandon him, he gets passed between unwitting adoptive family after unwitting adoptive family, before ending up in an ‚Äúorphanage‚Äù ‚Äî in 1990 no less ‚Äî and then landing in this movie. Along the way he destroys everything, and not a single moment of it is funny. For good measure, there‚Äôs also offensive and racist language, bottom-feeding bathroom humor and such ludicrous scenarios that it‚Äôs hard to even imagine this movie as a cartoon.

Freaky Friday Released: 2003 Box office: $110 million ($166.5 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: Freaky Friday There are plenty of diehard ""Freaky Friday"" fans, but there's no way this Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis feature would be produced today. Not with the inclusion of ""oriental mysticism,"" that is. In the movie, a mother accidentally switches places with her teenage daughter thanks to some magical fortune cookies they open at Pei-Pei's Chinese restaurant. The movie is supposed to be about understanding and respect, but the stereotyping of Asian culture didn't exactly align with that. The good news? Disney Channel remade ""Freaky Friday"" in 2018, minus the fortune cookie detail.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Released: 1937 Box office: $185 million ($3.6 billion today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is incredible in terms of animation. For a movie made in the 1930s, it's a work of pure genius and one that launched Walt Disney to stardom. The storyline and execution, however, are questionable. Fairytales aren't exactly known for being politically correct, which is why film adaptations usually take liberties with the plot. Snow White, however, stayed true to the original story. To start, Snow White is a bit of a clueless nincompoop hiding behind a veil of ""innocence."" Who takes an apple from some creepy stranger in the woods? Especially when you know an evil queen is out to get you? To make matters worse, after Snow White is poisoned, a prince she's never met kisses her while she's unconscious. What came off as romantic in the 1930s just seems creepy today.

Back to the Future Released: 1985 Box office: $211 million ($332 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: Back to the Future ""Back to the Future"" was a weird flick, if you think about it. Marty McFly needs to set his parents up with each other in the past to ensure his own existence. Already a little weird, but OK, we can deal with that.



But in the past, Marty's mom seems to find him attractive and hits on him through half the movie. Eww! George also spies on Lorraine while she's getting dressed. As if that's not bad enough, the movie also implies that Marty wrote ""Johnny B. Goode,"" a song by the Black rock 'n' roll pioneer Chuck Berry. Oh, and there's a sexual assault scene that's pretty much glossed over.

Spy Kids Released: 2001 Box office: $112.7 ($177 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: Spy Kids There's a lot to love about ""Spy Kids."" There's plenty of Latinx representation, and the entire movie feels like something straight out of a child's overactive imagination. It does, however, have some creepy notes. Fegan Floop, the host of a children's show, traps kids and turns them into weirdly shaped evil minions. He also sings the following lyrics to the kids watching his show: ""Some mean, nasty people want to have you for their supper ‚Äî but if you follow me, you can all be free."" Sounds more like the start of a cult or a kidnapping than a children's movie.

Ace Ventura: Pet Detective Released: 1994 Box office: $72.2 million ($135.4 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: Ace Ventura: Pet Detective Whether you love or hate Jim Carrey's overacting, there's a good chance you forgot how misguided and tasteless one of his Ace Ventura movies was. As a kid, the finer points probably went over your head. As an adult, we hope you can see what's wrong with a plot that depicts a transgender woman as the villain. The big reveal, in which Lois Einhorn reveals that she was actually former football player Ray Finkle, was supposed to be the ""funniest"" scene. There's nothing funny about demonizing a transgender person, however, especially when so many of them are still the targets of hate crimes and physical violence.

Blank Check Released: 1994 Box office: $30.6 million ($57.4 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: Blank Check ""Home Alone's"" storyline revolves around an 8-year-old being left alone on Christmas Eve, but we can get past the absurdity of that one. The creepiness of ""Blank Check"" is an entirely different matter. It aired on Disney and was marketed as a family movie ‚Äî even though it included a scene in which an adult woman practically made out with an 11-year-old boy. It was made in the 1990s, and the double standards are disturbing. If the roles had been reversed, with an adult man passionately kissing an 11-year-old girl, Disney would have been canceled. But back in 1994, it was somehow fine when the scene involved an underage boy instead. Yikes!

A Christmas Story Released: 1983 Box office: $20.6 million ($57.6 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: A Christmas Story It's completely possible to appreciate an old movie while still recognizing the elements in it that aren't the best. ""A Christmas Story"" is, mostly, a wholesome tale about a little boy named Ralphie who goes on an adventure to acquire a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas. Unfortunately, the movie also included racial humor throughout. At the end, there's even a scene with Asian immigrants at a Chinese restaurant singing ""Deck the Halls,"" with a chorus of ‚Äúfa-ra-ra-ra.‚Äù The movie was set in the 1940s, but it came out in the 1980s. For the time, we feel like they should have known better.

Annie Released: 1982 Box office: $57 million ($164.4 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: Annie The original ""Annie"" film is a classic, and it's better than any of the remakes. For the most part, it's a great story ‚Äî a rags-to-riches tale of a determined, fiery little orphan who inspires a billionaire to adopt every kid in the orphanage. The songs and dance numbers are upbeat and entertaining, and the movie is still worth watching today. The bad part? Daddy Warbucks, the wealthy aristocrat, has a manservant named Punjab, who's portrayed as having mythical powers. It perpetuates the ""magical minority"" stereotype, and to make matters worse, Punjab is played by African American actor Geoffrey Holder instead of an Indian man.

The Bad News Bears Released: 1976 Box office: $32.2 million ($157.4 million today) Rated: PG

Bottom Line: The Bad News Bears Well-loved for its humorous and heartwarming underdog storyline, ""The Bad News Bears"" became a template for all future kids' sports movies. You know how it goes; a rough-around-the-edges, middle-aged coach takes on a group of misfits and leads them to greatness. Cool. Except, in ""The Bad News Bears,"" there's a ton of sexism, plus a light sprinkling of underage drinking. Oh, and rampant, casual racism. The worst moment was when Tanner Boyle spews a long list of racial slurs in response to an African American boy joining the team, followed by, ‚Äúand now a girl?‚Äù Shudder.

Swiss Family Robinson Released: 1960 Box office: $40.4 million ($378.9 million today) Rated: PG"

The chain has been falling behind competitors like McDonald's and Wendy's, grasping at straws to remain relevant to younger, hungrier audiences. Along the way, the chain made some pretty big changes and additions but has most recently announced plans of going back to basics.

For more, check out 8 Secrets Burger King Doesn't Want You to Know.

Just like the Big Mac at McDonald's, the Whopper is Burger King's bread and butter; the signature menu item that's come to be synonymous with the company's flame-grilled ethos. The difference, though, is the fact that Burger King's fourth-quarter sales in the U.S. rose 1.8%, while the Big Mac-slinger outpaced it handily with a 7.5% gain. With sales lagging, Burger King is bringing out the big guns, or in this case, ""reclaiming the flame.""

In a recent earnings call, executives from parent company Restaurant Brands International touted the nostalgic glory of the Whopper as a key focal point for kickstarting Burger King sales in 2022. This includes marketing the sandwich better and making it faster to prepare, thus easier to get in the hands of drive-thru diners‚Äîand alleviating pesky wait times.

As with the Whopper's removal from the value menu, it's all part of a key plan to elevate an iconic product and give it the respect it merits. ""While we always strive to provide excellent value for money on a full menu basis, going forward, we will be purposeful and targeted when we choose to promote this iconic asset,"" said Tom Curtis, President of Burger King for US and Canada.

The chain is also whittling down the menu in general, to streamline preparation processes for workers, speed up orders for customers, and ensure that the Whopper is more front-and-center. By removing other potential menu distractions, the signature sandwich has a better chance to shine.

""For example, we have multiple hamburgers. And we have six ways of putting cheese on hamburgers. Put it on first, last, top, bottom, three slices, two slices. We condensed that. It involves less muscle memory,"" said Curtis.

What this means for diners in the U.S. is that the Burger King Whopper experience might soon look a little different, or at least feel a little faster. Pulling from successful strategies in international markets, where sales have fared far better (a 13.6% increase in 2021), the company promises new extensions and innovations around the Whopper.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

In many ways, it's a back-to-basics approach for Burger King's Whopper revival, to simplify operations and keep the spotlight on the sandwich that made it famous. ""We'll be focusing on our core, on the Whopper, flame-grilling, having it your way,"" Curtis says. ""Those are really the things that made us great, and the things that will make us great going forward."""

In 90 wedstrijden verzamelde Mitrogoal maar liefst 44 doelpunten, geen slecht gemiddelde. Ondertussen speelt de spits nog steeds bij Fulham, in de Championship. En daar gaat het goed. H√©√©l goed. Mitrovic is op weg om h√©t doelpuntenrecord te verpulveren.

Aleksandar Mitrovic

De statistieken van Mitrovic dit seizoen zijn echt verbluffend. Na 27 speeldagen in de Championship, de Engelse tweede klasse, staat de teller al op 30(!) goals. Het all-time record staat op naam van Ivan Toney, die vorig jaar met Brentford 31 keer wist te prikken. Het ziet er dus naar uit dat de voormalige Sportingboy het record gaat verpulveren, want ze zitten nog maar aan speeldag 29 van de 46. Straffe cijfers zijn dat!"

Porzingis now goes to a team that has Bradley Beal (out for the season due to injury) and Kyle Kuzma.

He was the fourth overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft by the New York Knicks, and was an All-Star in 2018.

In the two seasons that he played for the Mavs prior to this season, he averaged over 20 points per game in both seasons.

Buying a new graphics card in 2021 sure isn‚Äôt easy, or for the faint of heart or wallet. Fab-capacity shortages for manufacturing cutting-edge silicon are roiling the tech industry. The resulting supply crunch has hit the graphics card world the hardest.

The result? It's near-impossible for the average person to compete with cryptocurrency miners and scalpers in the race to see who can buy the latest graphics cards the quickest. These days, new cards, sold in limited quantities, sell out in an eyeblink at launch. Soon after, some of those very same cards show up on eBay or Craigslist at multiples of their manufacturer suggested retail prices (MSRPs). Existing cards, meanwhile, go out of stock almost as soon as fresh inventory is posted online or put on retail store shelves.

Sure, there was a run on video cards in 2017-2018, triggered by a crypto-mining craze. But it has relented, and buying a card before the COVID-19 pandemic began used to be as easy as a leisurely Amazon or Newegg order, or a field trip to your local Best Buy or Micro Center: Enter with a credit card, exit with a video card. No more!

The good news, though, is that it‚Äôs not impossible to land the card you want. Some enthusiasts have managed to upgrade their builds with the latest and greatest graphics tech despite these challenges. The bad news: It‚Äôs going to require more time than you might expect, a bit more savvy‚Äîand maybe even some fast action and sly moves.

Let's run through our five top suggested strategies for buying a new graphics card in this, the most challenging of times for GPU shoppers, PC gamers, and content creators.

1. Use Restock Notification Tools for Online Storefronts

You can‚Äôt buy a graphics card if you don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs restocked, and some tools and channels can help you with that. Stock levels are easier to track for digital sellers than it is for brick-and-mortar stores, which we‚Äôll get to in a minute. But actually buying a new GPU using this method will require a fair amount of luck.

Of course, you can park yourself on the product page of a given graphics card at your favorite reseller, and tap the F5 key, all day long, to refresh your browser. But that's tedious and ineffective. After all, each card appears on a discrete page of a site, and you can't keep track of, say, all the GeForce RTX 3070-based cards a seller has in its database, all the time. These are some of the easiest ways to keep track of an online retailer‚Äôs inventory without manually refreshing a web page until you finally score (or snore).

Discord and Telegram

Perhaps the simplest and lowest-commitment way of monitoring online inventory is to use Discord and Telegram. (For anyone who isn‚Äôt in the know: Discord is basically Slack for gamers, and Telegram is a highly automatable messaging service.) Intrepid users of both services have set up a variety of bots and communities dedicated to letting people know when a retailer‚Äôs website finally has graphics cards in stock.

Monitoring a Discord channel can give you instant in-stock alerts. (Image: Discord)

This method has a few upsides: It‚Äôs mostly passive, it‚Äôs free, and it‚Äôs totally legitimate. But there are some downsides, too, the most important among them being the fact that every other person who uses these bots or joins these communities will also be looking for a new graphics card. Anyone who‚Äôs shopped on Black Friday knows how quickly neighbors can become deadly rivals when the most-desired items are in short supply. (Our reporter Michael Kan, who experimented with bots and tried his level best to buy an AMD Radeon card via conventional retailer-stalking, ultimately came up aces thanks to an alert from the Discord channel Fixitfixitfixit Drops & Tech.)

YouTube and Twitch

The graphics card shortage has given rise to a new category of streamer: the restock monitor. Several channels on YouTube and Twitch have taken to monitoring various websites to see when they receive a new shipment of GPUs. When they do, they play a sound to let people who leave the channels running in the background know it‚Äôs time to switch tabs and race other viewers through the checkout process. Game on!

This method is fairly unobtrusive‚Äîall you have to do is listen up for the restock chime‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also less effective than using Discord or Telegram. Those services can notify you on any device when a GPU has been restocked; the YouTube and Twitch channels are only useful on the device being used to stream them. Anyone with a metered connection should also be wary of the data that will get consumed to keep streaming these videos around the clock.

Dedicated Inventory Trackers

Of course, you could always turn to ol‚Äô reliable instead of relying on these newfangled bots and servers and streaming channels. That‚Äôs right‚Äîit‚Äôs email‚Äôs time to shine.

Services like CamelCamelCamel can automatically email you when a graphics card's price drops (which is the service‚Äôs primary function) or comes back in stock. People have been using these services for years to track items they want to buy online.

The old standard (Image: CamelCamelCamel)

Unfortunately, this might be the worst method of trying to nail an in-stock notice on a new GPU. CamelCamelCamel, in particular, is limited to Amazon, where restocked graphics cards sell out almost instantly, and you have to set up alerts for individual products rather than checking for any modern graphics card. Other services, such as HotStock.io and NowInStock.net, might support more storefronts or aggregate multiple versions of a given GPU onto a single page, but the restriction to a specific product is still pretty common.

2. Keep Track of Inventory at Local Retailers

Physical storefronts offer a few advantages over their digital counterparts when it comes to finding a graphics card in stock. The primary one is reduced competition. Everyone can shop on Amazon; not everyone can visit your local Micro Center. (Pro tip: Micro Center, if you live where the chain has stores, is better than most retailers for nailing a GPU in person.) Why compete with cryptocurrency miners, scalpers, bots, and everyone else looking to buy a new graphics card online if you can find the same product on a store shelf?

Here are a few tips for buying a new graphics card at a local electronics store:

Sometimes, ""nice"" works. Be polite to the store‚Äôs employees. They aren‚Äôt responsible for the chip shortage, they don‚Äôt decide when graphics cards are restocked, and, in many cases, they are limited in their ability to help people get the products they want. But they‚Äôre going to be more likely to use what little wiggle room they have if you‚Äôre polite to them, than if you were rude. Exercise the golden rule. Call to ask which days of the week certain products are typically restocked. Stores often receive new shipments of a specific kind of device or gear on a predictable schedule. (Or at least as predictable as it can be, amid today's global supply problems.) Picking up the phone, politely asking when graphics cards are restocked, and planning your visit around that schedule can maximize your chances of landing a new GPU just as it hits the shelves. Use online tools to monitor in-store inventory. Retailers will often say when they have a product in stock at a local store on their websites, and even if they don‚Äôt, services like BrickSeek can often find that information for you. These methods aren‚Äôt foolproof‚Äîwe can‚Äôt think of any stores whose inventory systems offer up-to-the-minute updates‚Äîbut they can be useful.

3. Play the Lottery: Hope to Get Lucky With the Newegg Shuffle

Newegg decided to address the graphics card problem by taking a page from the sneaker industry‚Äôs playbook: raffles. You might be thinking that means you can enter for a chance to win a new GPU, but it‚Äôs not that straightforward. Instead, you enter for a chance to buy a new GPU, in much the same way sneakerheads have been hoping to score the latest drops at retail instead of being forced to pay resale prices.

This method is determined by luck, but so, to an extent, are the others on this list. Newegg is just more transparent about it. Unfortunately, graphics cards have been missing from recent Newegg Shuffles. Now, it‚Äôs just luck the whole way down: You have to hope you‚Äôre lucky enough to participate in a Newegg Shuffle offering graphics cards, and then you have to hope you‚Äôre lucky enough to win. May the odds be ever in your favor.

4. Buy a Pre-Built PC, and Sell the Other Parts

Even system manufacturers are struggling to source new GPUs for their PCs, but most have a more reliable line on finding some than the average consumer does. Much of that hardware is going to be put in a pre-built system out of which you could (at least theoretically) pluck the graphics card before selling the other parts to recoup your costs.

The problem is that finding buyers for components taken from a pre-built system isn‚Äôt as easy as it seems, even during a global chip shortage...especially when one of those components isn't the most-coveted one. Many pre-built systems feature dated hardware, or at least middle-of-the-line components that don‚Äôt compete with the latest and greatest offerings, so potential buyers might prefer to wait for new hardware to come in stock than to settle for parts that you don‚Äôt even want yourself.

Also note that depending on the system and its installed CPU, the PC may not be able to run without a graphics card installed. Some desktop CPUs have an integrated graphics processor (IGP) that you can use to run a display and operate the system even if the video card has been pulled. But other systems (notably those based on most of AMD's Ryzen processors) may rely on the video card for even the most basic graphics output. Some Intel CPUs, too, feature a disabled IGP; in most cases, these chips' model names end in the letter ""F"" (such as ""Core i7-11700KF"") and need a video card installed in the PC to push a signal to your monitor. This is especially common in major-maker prebuilt desktops, in which using an ""F"" chip saves the system maker a few bucks.

Pre-built systems are often expensive, too, especially if they feature modern graphics cards. Even if you do find buyers for some of the hardware you effectively shucked from the graphics card you actually wanted to purchase, you‚Äôre probably going to spend far more than you would have if you waited for that card to come back in stock and bought it at MSRP, or close to it. Don‚Äôt buy a pre-built system for this purpose unless you‚Äôre willing to make that trade, or you happen to need enough of the other bits.

5. Surrender to the Bot, and Become Part of the Problem (Just This Once)

We hesitate to propose this final option. It makes you (and us, by extension) part of the problem. But hey, here goes: In theory, you can either use a bot to buy a graphics card, or purchase the card you want from a scalper, who may well have plucked it from an online seller using one. We don‚Äôt advise either because (a.) it just makes things worse for other people and (b.) there‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôre going to get what you want, even if you fork over a bunch of bucks.

The Rent-a-Bot Route

We rented a bot to buy a graphics card earlier this year. It didn‚Äôt go well.

The process was more complicated than you might expect, required several hundred dollars up-front, and would have required an even greater investment to keep running. It also could have gotten our accounts banned from various online retailers, depending on their policies and the effectiveness of the bot creator‚Äôs anti-tracking technologies.

Our experiment with the Stellar bot got us in hot water...and got us zero video cards. (Image: Stellar)

Even with all that, the experiment was a failure. In the end, we were able to buy a graphics card because of a notification from a Discord community. The bot didn‚Äôt do anything. Others have had more luck‚Äîwhich is why miners and scalpers have been able to buy so many GPUs‚Äîbut the average person probably won‚Äôt be able to configure the bot correctly or afford the costs of running the bot until it finally achieves its goal.

Buying From a Scalper

Buying a new graphics card from a scalper would probably be the easiest method of acquiring one in 2021. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs also fraught with peril.

What if the listing is a scam? What if the graphics card doesn‚Äôt work? What if it's used and seems to work, but is going to be significantly more prone to failure because it was strained to the max to mine cryptocurrency? Video cards don't have odometers like cars, nor software like some SSDs do to track their cumulative usage stats. Platforms like eBay offer some protections for buyers, but most of the time, anyone who decides to buy from a scalper is exposing themselves to these risks.

Don't do it! (Image: eBay)

Note that some of these problems apply to legitimate (or at least seemingly legitimate) buyers on these platforms, as well. Even if someone isn‚Äôt asking for some exorbitant amount of money for a new graphics card, they might be selling a card that doesn‚Äôt perform at its peak or is close to failure. Like the second owner of a user car selling it to a potential third, they may not know all its history. These problems are hard to spot at the time of purchase, too, especially since you probably weren‚Äôt planning to bring your system with you to put the card through its paces before you bought it.

So, What Should I Do?

By now, it probably seems like there isn‚Äôt a single good way to buy a graphics card in 2021. And that perception is pretty accurate. All of these methods require some degree of luck, some kind of time commitment, and some willingness to work harder to buy new hardware than most people would expect. The easiest way to buy a graphics card, at least for now, would be to wait for supply to improve in the indeterminate future. Indeed, right now the r/pcmasterrace subreddit, under the thread ""Comprehensive guide on how to obtain a graphics card in 2021"" recommends the following two-step plan...

A sound strategy, if you ask us... (Image: Reddit)

Otherwise, our advice would be to combine as many of these methods‚Äîbarring the last one‚Äîas you‚Äôre comfortable with. It‚Äôs easier than ever to keep track of online inventory and the stock at local stores. Why not join a few Discord servers and make an acquaintance at the closest electronics store? Maybe, it‚Äôs indeed worth looking into pre-built systems, even if they aren‚Äôt particularly cost-effective. (If you need some of the other parts, after all, the extra cost of the system might work out to the same spend as paying a scalper for the card alone.) And, hey, at least it‚Äôs free to participate in the Newegg Shuffle.

""Take my money!"" has never been so hard as it is right now, but we think using several of these methods at once is the way to go. If you can hold out long enough, we're confident you will land the card you are looking for at a price you are willing to pay."

https://www.inc.com/kelly-main/amazon-primes-20-price-increase-comes-with-1-strange-perk-now-im-saving-over-1000-a-year.html,"Amazon announced surging profits of $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter, and it's costing Prime members. The trillion-dollar company is raising eyebrows as it's raising the price of Prime membership. Unlike its $10 delivery fee that comes with one major perk that can help the environment, the additional $20 per year should prompt a wakeup call to Amazon business-to-business and retail customers: Take a close look at what you're really spending on Amazon. If you do, you will realize that comparison shopping can put hundreds -- or even thousands -- back in your pocket.

As new and existing members learned that they will now have to pay $139 per year for membership, I learned how to save big time. No coupons or black-hat tactics required.

Like millions of other Prime members, I depend on Amazon for nearly every everyday item, from toothpaste to pet supplies. But while Amazon enables us to shop in our pajamas without schlepping to the store, it isn't the only modern-day mall where you can find just about anything in one location online.

So as Amazon makes the short-sighted mistake of thinking it is, I found myself forced to do something I admittedly don't love to do: I went shopping. But not on Amazon.

I went back to the first place you would go just a decade ago when you wanted the simplicity of knowing you were getting the lowest price: Walmart. Being the adult that I am, I took off my pajamas and put on my yoga pants for the event. And I was amazed.

Complacency and the Competition

After years of shopping on Amazon, I knew that, while Amazon was convenient, it wasn't the cheapest. But I didn't realize how much more expensive it is for a number of everyday products I purchase frequently.

For example, I could save $65 per year on shampoo alone. And I'm not talking about buying fancy, salon-quality products, but my late dad's favorite (and very pragmatic) pick, Pert Plus. At Amazon, one bottle costs $8.30 -- a price my dad would have thought outrageous. But over at Walmart, it's a practical price of $2.88.

It wasn't just some strange difference in shampoo prices. There are dozens of common items that add up to savings between $20 to $100 or more per year each. From paper towels, which cost over $16 on Amazon, and just $4.92 at Walmart (for a two-pack of Bounty Select-a-Size), to toothpaste, deodorant, and surge protectors. Never mind things like home goods, plants, toys, clothing, or electronics.

What I also didn't realize is that I didn't need to put on pants to shop at Walmart.

Not because Walmart gives shoppers a pretty loose dress code, but because it gives you other ways to shop beyond in-store. In addition to curbside pickup, it offers free two-day shipping for orders over $35. And to directly compete with Amazon Prime, there's Walmart Plus, which offers free, same-day shipping.

Business-Supply Bargains

Of course, Walmart probably isn't even the cheapest option. Especially when it comes to business supplies. You can expand your comparison shopping to Costco Business Center, Sam's Club business membership and the old standbys, Staples and Office Depot/OfficeMax. They are happy to compete on price and convenience when it comes to your business purchases, including candy and snacks, disposable items, janitorial products, and a range of other necessities.

But while Amazon has become something of a necessary evil -- just as Walmart once was (and for many, still is)--it's making a mistake that no company should: It's getting so comfortable that it's getting complacent.

The reality is that while the $20-per-year price increase is nominal at just $1.67 per month, the higher price isn't what will end up pushing customers away. It's the lower-priced competitors that might lure them in. Because it's not just that Amazon isn't paying enough attention to its customers -- it isn't paying enough attention to its competition. And though your competitors shouldn't run your business, you also don't want your customers running to your competitors.

For me, the price of Prime is still worth its value between its unique and hard-to-find products, extensive product reviews, extras like Prime Video, and its game-changing features. And of course, there are a number of items there that are priced below the competition. But moving forward, I am going to save more money with the same income by being a more conscious consumer and taking advantage of competitors who offer the same products at cheaper prices."

https://cnbc.netblogpro.com/2022/02/07/treasury-yields-slip-back-after-strong-surge-on-us-jobs-data.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note retreated 1 basis point to 1.919%. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond ticked down a basis point to 2.222%. Yields move inversely to prices and 1 basis point is equal to 0.01%.

Treasury yields were little changed on Monday, cooling after a strong surge in the previous session, as investors digested economic data and looked ahead to the new trading week.

Yields have jumped in the opening weeks of 2022 as the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will hike rates multiple times this year. The 10-year yield was trading near 1.5% at the end of December.

""Once you get the story and you get some legs behind the bond market, a lot of times it sort of overdoes itself as people over-position one way or the other,"" said John Luke Tyner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. ""So I wouldn't be surprised if we push up to [2.25% on the 10-year] by say mid-summer, and really I think it is going to come down to how does the market view, once the Fed finally hikes, what that prompts for future growth.""

Yields have risen as investors weigh high inflation and strong economic growth.

The Labor Department said Friday that the economy added 467,000 jobs in January. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected an addition of just 150,000 jobs, with some Wall Street pros projecting net jobs losses for the month due to the omicron variant surge. After the news on Friday, the 10-year yield hit its highest level since December 2019.

Claims for the week ended Jan. 29 totaled 238,000, a touch lower than the 245,000 Dow Jones estimate, the Labor Department reported Thursday."

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/08/35-year-old-mom-quit-job-to-work-on-ebay-side-hustle-and-made-141-million-in-one-year.html,"In 2011, when I wasn't working my $25,000-per-year insurance job or spending time with my family, you could find me shopping online. I was 24 years old, and I loved browsing the internet for clothes that were both on-trend and affordable. Unfortunately, there weren't too many options back then. That's what gave me the idea to start a side hustle selling women's clothing on eBay. At first, it was just a fun hobby. Little did I know, 10 years later, my husband Chris and I would be running Pink Lily full-time. Last year, our online clothing business generated $141 million in gross sales. And today, our social media audience has grown to 3.6 million followers.

From an eBay side hustle to $141 million in sales

To start our eBay store, my husband Chris and I made an initial investment of about $300 to buy clothes and accessories from a wholesale website. Since I wasn't familiar with pricing strategies, I priced items at what I would pay as a customer. We worked out of our living room, so we didn't have much overhead to worry about except for shipping costs. Profits varied during the first few years, but we typically made anywhere from $300 to $1,000 per month. We used that money to pay off student loans and invest back into the business. I'd fly to Los Angeles to meet with vendors and place product orders, and eventually started attending trade shows to expand our line of selections.

Two years later, in 2013, I started a personal Facebook group to market my clothes. We had loyal customers who showed an increasing demand for our products, especially in our local community in Bowling Green, Kentucky. By the end of the year, we had saved around $20,000 from our profits, which we used to launch Pink Lily's official website. That's when business really began booming. In May 2014, we surpassed $100,000 in monthly revenue. After three years of running Pink Lily as a side hustle, I quit my insurance job to work on the business full-time. Chris joined me a few months later to oversee the company's finances and operations. We closed the year with more than $4 million in revenue. In 2019, after achieving $70 million in total sales, we received a minority stake investment to support the business' rapid growth. This helped us expand our product offerings and scale an amazing team. Currently, we sell more than 11,000 products on our site every day, have a brick-and-mortar store and, with 250 full-time employees, are one of the biggest employers in Bowling Green.

While we still visit trade shows, we now have a core group of vendor partners who we work with to create custom designs. Co-founding Pink Lily alongside my husband has been the journey of a lifetime. Here are my best tips for starting a successful business: 1. Find a gap in the market You've probably heard some version of this before, but I can't kick off entrepreneurial advice without hammering this point home: It's so important to find a gap in the existing market. When I started my side hustle, I saw an unmet need for fashion-inclined women who wanted to be able to find a dress for $50 or less. I knew I could help to fill that need in my own small way.

2. Reinvest your profits If you want growth to happen quickly, you need to reinvest all or most of your early profits back into the business. You may be very strapped for cash during the first few years. That was our experience, and it wasn't easy. We worked up to 60 hours per week, lived frugally, and reinvested the money we made back into growing Pink Lilly. 3. Find fun, unique ways to engage your social media followers Being active on social media has been a key part of our success. We regularly ask our 1.4 million Instagram followers what they'd like to see on our site and on our shelves. For example, we'll post photos of items we are considering purchasing or brands we could partner with for Pink Lily. Then we'll use everyone's responses and feedback to make any final decisions. This helps shoppers feel like insiders and part of the family.

Vin Diesel Teases Major Fast & Furious 10 Production News

At this point, it seems that each new installment of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise is destined to upstage the action from the previous film, no matter how absurd, unbelievable, or downright excessive these action sequences might be. What started as a film franchise about illegal street racing has transformed fully into a series focused on massive action set pieces, complex heists, and plenty of overly-elaborate fight sequences. Over the years, we have watched the ""Fast and Furious"" team drive their cars off skyscrapers, parachute their cars out of an airplane, and (in the series' most recent installment) they even brought their cars into space.

At this point, the films play more like superhero movies than anything else, though perhaps that's the point. Each one is still incredibly entertaining, and the franchise is beloved by legions of fans worldwide.

Those fans recently got some fantastic news regarding the series' next installment, ""Fast & Furious 10,"" courtesy of Vin Diesel himself."

But if you took to the sky in 2021, JetBlue might have let you down ‚Äî with large numbers of brutal, hours-long delays and frustrating cancellations, according to a new study.

The Long Island City, New York-based airline recently dropped to the lowest spot on The Wall Street Journal's annual ranking of U.S. airlines, falling behind both Spirit and Frontier. American Airlines almost incurred a similar fate, tying with Frontier for third-to-last.

Delta Air Lines claimed the top spot on the list, followed by Alaska Airlines and Southwest Airlines.

The list, released on Jan. 28, ranked the nine largest U.S. airlines based on their performance in 2021 across seven categories: on-time arrivals, cancelled flights, extreme delays, tarmac waits longer than two hours, mishandled baggage, passengers being involuntary bumped from flights and customer complaints.

It relies on data from the U.S. Department and Transportation and aviation analysis software firm masFlight.

Here are the overall rankings:

1. Delta Air Lines

2. Alaska Airlines

3. Southwest Airlines

4. United Airlines

5. Allegiant Air

Tie-6. American Airlines

Tie-6. Frontier Airlines

8. Spirit Airlines

9. JetBlue Airways

The analysis found that JetBlue had the highest rate of extreme delays and incidents where passengers had to wait on the tarmac for at least two hours. JetBlue also had the second-fewest on-time arrivals, behind only Allegiant Air, and the second-most customer complaints behind Spirit, according to the ranking.

It wasn't all bad news for JetBlue: The carrier had the fourth-fewest involuntary bumpings and cancellations. JetBlue did end the year by cancelling about 1,280 flights from Dec. 30 through Jan. 13 after a surge in Covid-19 infections, but most of those cancellations didn't appear in the analysis, which was restricted to 2021 data."

To date, The Beatles are the most successful music artists in the history of the world and remain as popular as ever over 60 years since they formed. Last night, Sir Paul McCartney was a talking head on BBC One‚Äôs The Queen: 70 Glorious Years, looking back at the band‚Äôs impact during the monarch‚Äôs reign, including the big changes in youth culture during the 1960s. And at one point the 79-year-old made a huge claim during the programme concerning the Fab Four‚Äôs formation.

McCartney was reflecting on the UK‚Äôs National Service, which had come into force in January 1949.

It meant that all physically fit young men aged between 17-21 had to serve in one of the British armed forces for 18 months.

The peacetime call-up after World War II ended in 1960, and The Beatles‚Äô legend reckons this was extraordinarily significant for his band.

He said: ‚ÄúWe were the generation that grew up fully expecting to go in the National Service. And then the second we qualified, it was as if God came down and sort of parted the waters and said, ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt have to go in.‚Äô It was like, ‚ÄòOh thanks!‚Äô And I say, without that, there wouldn‚Äôt have been The Beatles. [The Sixties youth culture] was such an awakening. You were part of a cultural revolution. You wouldn‚Äôt call it that, it was just having fun.‚Äù"

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-covid-death-rate-in-the-u-s-is-so-much-higher-than-other-wealthy-nations,"Geoff Bennett:

Judy, those troubling statistics have been persistent since COVID first spread.

And, today, an analysis by The New York Times underscores just how deep these problems are. It compared the U.S. death rate for COVID to other wealthy industrialized countries. America had the highest rates. And, as you can see on this simplified chart of The Times' data, the U.S. rate was higher than Britain, Germany, Canada, and Japan, just to name a few.

And the disparity has been even worse during the spread of Omicron.

So, why are we continuing to struggle?

We dig into that now with Jennifer Nuzzo, who studies epidemiology and global health at the Johns Hopkins Center For Health.

It's good to have you with us. And we will start there.

What accounts for this high death rate, the U.S., as compared to its peer nations?

Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security: I mean, first of all, we have to acknowledge that it's a complete and utter tragedy, because the vast majority of the deaths have been preventable, because many of them have occurred, in fact, most of them have occurred since the development of the COVID-19 vaccines.

But what we're really seeing is the effect of the United States not making enough progress in vaccinating adults against the virus . And people who are not protected from severe illness by vaccine are, unfortunately, the ones most likely to die."

https://screenrant.com/wookiees-buttholes-teeth-star-wars-canon-peacemaker/,"Warning! Spoilers ahead for Peacemaker episode 3.

Thanks to a joke made by John Cena in HBO's new DC series Peacemaker, people are actually wondering if Star Wars Wookiees have teeth in their buttholes. While the Star Wars canon certainly has a wealth of trivia and odd layers to its expansive continuity, this would definitely be one of the strangest. However disturbing of a concept it may be, it's already become a leading search question on Google after Peacemaker episode 3, so viewers clearly want to get to the bottom of whether or not Wookiees such as Chewbacca or Black Krrsantan are secretly horrifying.

SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY

In Peacemaker episode 3, John Cena's Peacemaker is working with his team to eliminate a hidden threat known as Project Butterfly, revealed to be actual alien butterflies controlling humans inside their heads. When Peacemaker and his friend/partner Vigilante (Freddie Stroma) are captured by the butterflies, they're tied up and guarded by Judo Master (Nhut Le) before being tortured. Being his obnoxious self, Peacemaker begins trashing talking with Judo Master, making digs at his small stature and short height, which is how Wookiees eventually get brought into the conversation.

Related: Peacemaker Just Confirmed ANOTHER Joker Exists In The DCEU

Comparing Judo Master to one of his old action figures, Peacemaker says he wants to put him with all of his G.I Joes while warning him not to go near or have sex with Chewbacca due to a disturbing Star Wars ""fact"": ""Wookiees have teeth on their a**holes. That's canon!"" Thankfully, it can be confirmed that they most certainly do not, as there is nothing that has ever been produced or published in the Star Wars franchise that would ever make that true or canonical. However, Peacemaker's director James Gunn seems to be enjoying the cultural impact his show is having given his post on Twitter about the trending Google search: ""Just #Peacemaker influencing the cultural conversation with his usual grace,"" Gunn tweeted before sharing a screenshot of the trending (and misspelled) Google search query ""do wookies have teeth on their buttholes.""

In terms of why Peacemaker would claim this disturbing Star Wars concept as truth, it's because he's largely an idiot who also thinks ""butt-babies"" are real (see the same episode). In just a few episodes, the show has quickly established that Peacemaker's gullible nature and complete absence of critical thinking skills leads to him believing just about anything he sees on the internet. However, the closest canonical thing in Star Wars that resembles anything remotely like Wookiees having teeth in their buttholes is perhaps a creature known as a Verkle, the animals used as bait by the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, resulting in the Rebels being captured when Chewbacca was drawn to them (made using the back half of a taxidermied deer with teeth added). It's possible Peacemaker heard elements of this as a rumor and began claiming the disturbing untruth about Wookiees as fact, believing it to be canon to the Star Wars galaxy.

While Peacemaker is wrong about Wookiees and their buttholes (because of course he is), it's quite the hilarious study on cultural influences and the impact a series like Peacemaker can make from one simple joke. It also helps that John Cena's character thew out the word ""canon,"" a term held in near-sacred reverence by fans when it comes to franchises such as Star Wars. In any case, people can rest easy knowing that Chewbacca and Black Krrsantan aren't hiding a disturbing anatomical horror under their pelts.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-05/inside-us-raid-on-isis-leader-months-of-preparation/100805902,"US forces rehearsed the helicopter raid over and over, hoping to capture Islamic State's leader on the third floor of a residential building in a Syrian town on the Turkish border, where he was holed up with his family.

Key points: Planning for the capture operation began in early December, when US officials believed they knew the whereabouts of the Islamic State leader

Planning for the capture operation began in early December, when US officials believed they knew the whereabouts of the Islamic State leader Al-Quraishi rarely left his residence to avoid US capture, having relied on couriers to interact with the outside world

Al-Quraishi rarely left his residence to avoid US capture, having relied on couriers to interact with the outside world Syrian rescue workers say at least 13 people died, most of them women and children

But before they could reach him, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi detonated a suicide bomb, triggering a large explosion that blew mangled bodies ‚Äî including his own ‚Äî out of the building into the streets outside.

US President Joe Biden, who monitored the raid from the White House's Situation Room, called al-Qurayshi's suicide a ""final act of desperate cowardice"".

""With no regard to the lives of his own family or others in the building, he chose to blow himself up,"" he said.

It echoed the self-detonation of a bomb by his predecessor, Islamic State founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, during a US raid in 2019 in Syria.

Locals were told to leave the area by US forces on loudspeakers, Atmeh reisdent Saddam al-Osman said. ( ABC )

Locals terrified during lengthy raid

For residents in the town of Atmeh, the events were terrifying, as US forces swept in aboard helicopters before trying to evacuate civilians from the cinder-block building, using loudspeakers to tell them to leave.

""For more than two and a half hours they were in the air, and we heard the sound of machine guns and air strikes,"" said local resident Saddam al-Osman.

""Men, women and children raise your hands. You are in safety of the American coalition that is surrounding the area. You will die if you don't get out,"" said one woman recounting the US warnings.

Impact of blast 'ejects' people from building

Marine General Frank McKenzie, who oversees US forces in the region and was providing updates to Mr Biden, said US troops got six civilians, including four children, to leave the first floor of the building before the blast ripped apart the top floor.

""The explosion, which was more massive than would be expected from a suicide vest, killed everyone on the third floor and, in fact, ejected multiple people from the building,"" General McKenzie said, adding that al-Qurayshi, his wife and two children died.

A second US official later said two of al-Qurayshi's wives and one child were killed.

As US troops advanced to the second floor, one of al-Qurayshi's lieutenants and his wife started firing on the Americans and were killed.

One child was found dead there, General McKenzie said, and three other children and an infant were brought to safety from the second floor.

Syrian rescue workers said at least 13 people died, most of them women and children.

The Pentagon said at least two armed members of a local Al Qaeda affiliate were killed by gunfire from a US helicopter after they approached the scene of the raid while US troops were still at the site.

Recluse rarely left compound

US officials said al-Qurayshi's death was another setback for a group that once ruled a self-proclaimed caliphate stretching across territory in Syria and Iraq.

It is now waging insurgent attacks.

Planning for the operation began in early December, when officials became convinced the Islamic State leader was living in the building, the officials said.

Mr Biden received a detailed briefing on options for capturing al-Qurayshi alive on December 20, a senior White House official said.

One official said the operation was complicated by the fact al-Qurayshi rarely left his residence on the building's third floor and relied on couriers to interact with the outside world.

Islamic State leaders prefer death to capture, even if it means losing family members. ( ABC )

Bruce Hoffman, senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations, said this kind of self-isolation was to avoid the fate of his predecessor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

""He deliberately kept a low profile in hopes precisely of avoiding this outcome,"" he said.

""And that I think has become something of a fashion with terrorist leaders now and in the future.""

Raid 'designed to preserve innocent life'

The number of children seen in the area and families believed to be living on the first floor led US officials to try to craft a mission aiming to safeguard civilians, officials said.

That ultimately required putting US forces at risk in a raid, instead of launching a remote strike, the officials said.

""The plan was for two hours on site. And it speaks to the level of care that US special operations forces used in this mission, which was designed to preserve innocent life,"" said Pentagon spokesman Joe Kirby.

US military procedures to guard against civilian casualties are under scrutiny following a high-profile mistaken drone strike in Kabul during the US evacuation of civilians from Afghanistan that the Pentagon initially hailed a success.

The Pentagon said it would review all the information from the Atmeh raid to ensure no civilians were harmed by US forces, but stressed all indications so far were that civilian deaths were caused by Islamic State fighters themselves.

US officials say al-Quraishi's death was another setback for the militant group. ( Reuters: The White House )

Observing from the Situation Room

Mr Biden gave final approvals for the mission on Tuesday during an Oval Office meeting with Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the top American military officer, US officials said.

Mr Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and other administration officials received real-time updates from Mr Austin, General Milley and General McKenzie as they watched the operation unfold on several screens from the Situation Room, the officials said.

The President joined the group in the Situation Room around 5pm local time on Wednesday after finishing a call with French President Emmanuel Macron on an unrelated topic, the White House official said.

US forces destroyed one of their helicopters which had suffered mechanical problems. ( Reuters )

At one point, a helicopter involved in the raid suffered a mechanical failure and had to be destroyed rather than left behind, the Pentagon said.

Mr Biden said ""God bless our troops"" once US forces were wheels up after the operation and kept tabs on them during the night as they flew to safety, officials said.

Once US forces were in safety, Mr Biden reflected on an air strike carried out in 2015 ‚Äî when he was serving as vice-president ‚Äî that killed another ISIS leader and injured al-Qurayshi, costing him a leg, the White House official said.

DNA test to confirm death

Mr Milley told Mr Biden that US forces hit ""a visual ID jackpot"" when they viewed al-Qurayshi's body and confirmed his identity using biometric data taken from a fingerprint during the flight back, the official said.

They waited to announce his death until after a DNA test was completed, the official added.

""He was on our target list from the earliest days of the campaign. He was al-Baghdadi's right-hand man, and ‚Ä¶ was personally responsible for some of the most vicious ISIS atrocities,"" the official.

We all want women to look beautiful. No matter how beautiful your face is, if you do not have a shapely body, the look you bring will not be so attractive. Obesity completely changes the shape of a woman's body and is one of the major causes of anxiety in women. On the other hand, body shape, however, is an essential factor for a healthy life.

Even though Westerners use more fatty foods than we do, they are constantly engaged in fat burning exercises. It has become an integral part of their lives. But the Sri Lankan diet is an increase in obesity and a reluctance to exercise. Obesity increases in women, especially after marriage, but they are less interested in controlling the condition. Being overworked can cause it. However, it is important to set aside an hour and a half a day for exercise. It is not difficult to get up in the morning and exercise, or to get some exercise after work or homework.

Fitness is the most important thing in life. Today, due to our eating habits and habits, not only diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol but also the prevalence of deadly diseases like heart disease and cancer have increased. A healthy body and mind adds lightness to our lives.

Physically fit people are less likely to have heart and other health problems as they are healthier and control their body weight properly. A person needs to be physically active in order to maintain a relaxed mood. A person who is physically and mentally strong will have enough strength to cope with life's setbacks and life will not change drastically.

Lifestyle changes are needed to get fit. You will need to exercise regularly in your life as well as get accustomed to a healthy diet. By giving up bad habits like smoking and alcohol and getting adequate rest you will be able to stay physically and mentally strong.

We all want women to look beautiful. No matter how beautiful your face is, if you do not have a shapely body, the look you bring will not be so attractive. Obesity completely changes the shape of a woman's body and is one of the major causes of anxiety in women. On the other hand, body shape, however, is an essential factor for a healthy life.

Even though Westerners use more fatty foods than we do, they are constantly engaged in fat burning exercises. It has become an integral part of their lives. But the Sri Lankan diet is an increase in obesity and a reluctance to exercise. Obesity increases in women, especially after marriage, but they are less interested in controlling the condition. Being overworked can cause it. However, it is important to set aside an hour and a half a day for exercise. It is not difficult to get up in the morning and exercise, or to get some exercise after work or homework.

Fitness is the most important thing in life. Today, due to our eating habits and habits, not only diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol but also the prevalence of deadly diseases like heart disease and cancer have increased. A healthy body and mind adds lightness to our lives.

Physically fit people are less likely to have heart and other health problems as they are healthier and control their body weight properly. A person needs to be physically active in order to maintain a relaxed mood. A person who is physically and mentally strong will have enough strength to cope with life's setbacks and life will not change drastically.

Lifestyle changes are needed to get fit. You will need to exercise regularly in your life as well as get accustomed to a healthy diet. By giving up bad habits like smoking and alcohol and getting adequate rest you will be able to stay physically and mentally strong. Temporary removal of all food particles that are harmful to the body allows the unwanted parts to be flushed out and strengthened. Be sure to spend more time outdoors with sunlight and engage in healthy activities that provide fresh air. Running, cycling, swimming, walking and playing soccer with your children should be part of your lifestyle."
https://www.imore.com/apple-privacy-changes-wipe-278-billion-market-value-4-companies,"A new report has revealed that four social media companies have lost some $278 billion in market value since Apple announced changes to privacy on iPhone last year.

From Markets Insider on the impact of Apple's tracking privacy changes in iOS 14:

The earnings results from social media companies on Wednesday highlighted the weakness to investors, resulting in a steep sell-off in their stocks. In Thursday trades, Meta Platforms fell 22%, Snap fell 18%, Twitter fell 8%, and Pinterest fell 11%. Since Apple's privacy update went into effect in late April 2021, these four social media companies have erased a combined $278 billion in market value.

The report notes Meta's value has fallen by $169 billion since April 26, 2021. Similarly, Snap has fallen by $50 billion, Twitter by $26 billion, and Pinterest by $33 billion. For Snap, Twitter, and Pinterest, those losses represent around half of their previous market values, a staggering decline.

It comes after Facebook missed its Q4 earnings targets this week, and announced that it expects changes made by Apple last year to cost the company some $10 billion in revenue, sending shares in freefall on Wednesday, a trend that continued when the markets opened.

Apple made tracking users via an IDFA number an opt-in feature, as the company continues to highlight privacy as one of the best iPhone features on offer."

The desire of a healthy average person for the subject of sex and sexuality is extremely reasonable and natural. But the path that man seeks for the satisfaction of sexual feelings must adapt to the culture of a country and not go beyond the boundaries of social morality. It is on this basis that the society respectfully accepts the space for sexual intercourse in a legal relationship called marriage. But today the family corporation is in deep turmoil. The bond and integrity that should exist within a family in economic, social, and political matters has been damaged. The occurrence of casual relationships is one of the main factors here. Sometimes married men have relationships with girls as young as their own daughter. The basis of these casual relationships is direct sex. There are many instances in society today where corruption and murder are the end result of these ties.

Today, women are more inclined to use cosmetics. With these beauty treatments, you will be able to retain your youth and beauty for a long time.

Also, in the increasing trend towards fashion, short dresses and feminine features have become popular today.

Google has recently revealed that Sri Lanka is the second most searched country for the word 'sex' on the internet.

Today, people from school children to the elderly are addicted to building friendships through Facebook. In many cases, these relationships, which go around and out of bounds, end in casual relationships. There have been many recent reports of young women, especially young girls, developing such relationships without any credibility being adversely affected by their future.

A young woman who was stripped naked in front of a Facebook boyfriend via Skype has finally committed suicide after receiving threats that her nude would be released online.

Attitudinal transformation of society, religious leaders' zeal in the subject, building an open support base on the family, not using technology for destruction but for the betterment, respect for religious teachings, and a better understanding of social reality through socialization help women not to fall prey to men. Is.

The solutions are to use fashion in a way that is not a prostitute but a girl, to dress in a way that does not unnecessarily expose the body parts and to develop self-discipline, to shape the male mindset to look at women with respect from an early age, and to prevent rape."

https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/richard-branson-diet-health-tips.html,"If I asked you to close your eyes and picture Richard Branson, what image would come to mind? You might think of him strapped into a Virgin Galactic rocket shooting into space, or performing some wild publicity stunt like trying to fly a hot air balloon around the world. Perhaps you'd picture him kitesurfing with some celebrity on his private Caribbean island.

Whatever came to mind, I'm going to guess it was active and daring. Now I have another question for you: How old exactly is Sir Richard these days? Don't Google it: He's 71.

Take those two paragraphs and put them together and what do you get? A septuagenarian grandfather who, far from being creaky and forgetful, appears to be maintaining incredible levels of energy and fitness. Which is why I didn't click away when I visited Branson's blog recently and saw a post on how he eats for greater health. Entrepreneurs in general may not be the best sources of nutrition advice, but Branson seems like a guy who knows something about aging well.

Meet Richard Branson's diet guru.

The specific disease-fighting diet Branson follows was designed by Harvard-trained cancer doctor William Li, who argues that certain superfoods help the body ward off diseases like cancer and heart disease. Li recently spoke at a Virgin Unite gathering, and Branson reports being inspired by his work to improve his own diet.

""I have long prioritized an all-round healthy lifestyle. I exercise daily in the form of tennis, kitesurfing, swimming, weights, and cycling (sometimes to my detriment!). I go to bed at 9 p.m. when possible, I have an incredible team around me to help manage stress and am blessed with the most incredible friends and family. And diet, according to Dr. Li, is the final pillar to help realize full health potential,"" Branson writes.

Happily, many of the foods recommended by Li are ones you likely already enjoy. Branson apparently indulges in three every day.

""Dr. Li argues that drinking one to three cups of coffee a day lowers the risk of heart failure by 33 percent. And that by eating one kiwi fruit a day you can increase protection of your DNA from oxidative damage by 60 percent,"" Branson reports. ""He also suggests that by sipping five cups per day of green tea you can significantly lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.""

If that sounds intriguing to you, you can pick up Li's book Eat to Beat Disease for lots more information, but here to get you started is a sampling of other foods Li claims help prevent disease. Eating all of them every day is a tall order, but regularly adding as many as you can to your diet should help you stay healthy and avoid disease.

Coffee for disease-fighting flavanols Green tea for polyphenols like EGCG Mango Fresh berries Kiwi fruit for vitamin C and antioxidants Oatmeal Sourdough bread for its effect on the microbiome Hard cheeses such as Gouda, Muenster, and Camembert for vitamin K2 Leafy greens like kale, spinach, arugula, and radicchio Legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and beans for protein, fiber, iron, and vitamins and minerals Small tinned fish like sardines, mackerel, and anchovies for omega-3 fatty acids Tomato sauce for the antioxidant lycopene Extra virgin olive oil Walnuts for omega-3 fats, B vitamins, and magnesium Dark chocolate"

As new and existing members learned that they will now have to pay $139 per year for membership, I learned how to save big time. No coupons or black-hat tactics required.

Like millions of other Prime members, I depend on Amazon for nearly every everyday item, from toothpaste to pet supplies. But while Amazon enables us to shop in our pajamas without schlepping to the store, it isn't the only modern-day mall where you can find just about anything in one location online.

So as Amazon makes the short-sighted mistake of thinking it is, I found myself forced to do something I admittedly don't love to do: I went shopping. But not on Amazon.

I went back to the first place you would go just a decade ago when you wanted the simplicity of knowing you were getting the lowest price: Walmart. Being the adult that I am, I took off my pajamas and put on my yoga pants for the event. And I was amazed.

Complacency and the Competition

After years of shopping on Amazon, I knew that, while Amazon was convenient, it wasn't the cheapest. But I didn't realize how much more expensive it is for a number of everyday products I purchase frequently.

For example, I could save $65 per year on shampoo alone. And I'm not talking about buying fancy, salon-quality products, but my late dad's favorite (and very pragmatic) pick, Pert Plus. At Amazon, one bottle costs $8.30 -- a price my dad would have thought outrageous. But over at Walmart, it's a practical price of $2.88.

It wasn't just some strange difference in shampoo prices. There are dozens of common items that add up to savings between $20 to $100 or more per year each. From paper towels, which cost over $16 on Amazon, and just $4.92 at Walmart (for a two-pack of Bounty Select-a-Size), to toothpaste, deodorant, and surge protectors. Never mind things like home goods, plants, toys, clothing, or electronics.

What I also didn't realize is that I didn't need to put on pants to shop at Walmart.

Not because Walmart gives shoppers a pretty loose dress code, but because it gives you other ways to shop beyond in-store. In addition to curbside pickup, it offers free two-day shipping for orders over $35. And to directly compete with Amazon Prime, there's Walmart Plus, which offers free, same-day shipping.

Business-Supply Bargains

Of course, Walmart probably isn't even the cheapest option. Especially when it comes to business supplies. You can expand your comparison shopping to Costco Business Center, Sam's Club business membership and the old standbys, Staples and Office Depot/OfficeMax. They are happy to compete on price and convenience when it comes to your business purchases, including candy and snacks, disposable items, janitorial products, and a range of other necessities.

But while Amazon has become something of a necessary evil -- just as Walmart once was (and for many, still is)--it's making a mistake that no company should: It's getting so comfortable that it's getting complacent.

The reality is that while the $20-per-year price increase is nominal at just $1.67 per month, the higher price isn't what will end up pushing customers away. It's the lower-priced competitors that might lure them in. Because it's not just that Amazon isn't paying enough attention to its customers -- it isn't paying enough attention to its competition. And though your competitors shouldn't run your business, you also don't want your customers running to your competitors.

For me, the price of Prime is still worth its value between its unique and hard-to-find products, extensive product reviews, extras like Prime Video, and its game-changing features. And of course, there are a number of items there that are priced below the competition. But moving forward, I am going to save more money with the same income by being a more conscious consumer and taking advantage of competitors who offer the same products at cheaper prices."

The Internet is the basis of this revolutionary transformation in the traditional media. The impact of internet communication on social and personal lives is not insignificant. In particular, online journalism, also known as academia, has helped to create a new human being who has subjugated cultural man and transcended culture. Simple technology, ease of use, and low cost have been found to be the primary factors in the spread of the new media community, replacing radio and television, which are the most widely used mediums of traditional communication with a very complex and large capital investment.

It has now created the ability for anyone to socialize a message of their choice through the new media using the Internet at minimal cost, which has also overshadowed the role of the traditional and professional journalist. Through this, anyone has the ability to socialize a media message of their choice using their new media tool. This can be called Citizen Journalism.

But today, new media trends have seriously contributed to the reversal of these issues. The main reason for this is that a large range of time and space has been created to be selected at the discretion of the receiver. This unique quality of the new media has strongly influenced the adaptation of traditional media and their gradual adaptation to new media trends. For example, although television and radio in the general sense are traditional media (PEO TV), television is now being transformed into a new medium through the ability to watch the program of one's choice at any time. Radio, a traditional medium, is also emerging as a new medium, allowing people to listen to their favorite program on the Internet whenever they want.

The most important work to consider through all of this is the cultural impact that new media trends have had on individuals and social lives. The use of new media without regulation or oversight has enabled technology to reveal identities in individuals' lives as well as to conceal identities. It has also affected various social issues, concealing individual identities as well as creating false identities and thereby influencing socio-cultural relations. The impact of Facebook, a social media stream that is a popular trend in the new media, on the lives of certain individuals, has become an important theme for case studies as well as research topics. In this way new media trends and their social impact can be discussed."

https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/richard-branson-diet-health-tips.html,"If I asked you to close your eyes and picture Richard Branson, what image would come to mind? You might think of him strapped into a Virgin Galactic rocket shooting into space, or performing some wild publicity stunt like trying to fly a hot air balloon around the world. Perhaps you'd picture him kitesurfing with some celebrity on his private Caribbean island.

Whatever came to mind, I'm going to guess it was active and daring. Now I have another question for you: How old exactly is Sir Richard these days? Don't Google it: He's 71.

Take those two paragraphs and put them together and what do you get? A septuagenarian grandfather who, far from being creaky and forgetful, appears to be maintaining incredible levels of energy and fitness. Which is why I didn't click away when I visited Branson's blog recently and saw a post on how he eats for greater health. Entrepreneurs in general may not be the best sources of nutrition advice, but Branson seems like a guy who knows something about aging well.

Meet Richard Branson's diet guru.

The specific disease-fighting diet Branson follows was designed by Harvard-trained cancer doctor William Li, who argues that certain superfoods help the body ward off diseases like cancer and heart disease. Li recently spoke at a Virgin Unite gathering, and Branson reports being inspired by his work to improve his own diet.

""I have long prioritized an all-round healthy lifestyle. I exercise daily in the form of tennis, kitesurfing, swimming, weights, and cycling (sometimes to my detriment!). I go to bed at 9 p.m. when possible, I have an incredible team around me to help manage stress and am blessed with the most incredible friends and family. And diet, according to Dr. Li, is the final pillar to help realize full health potential,"" Branson writes.

Happily, many of the foods recommended by Li are ones you likely already enjoy. Branson apparently indulges in three every day.

""Dr. Li argues that drinking one to three cups of coffee a day lowers the risk of heart failure by 33 percent. And that by eating one kiwi fruit a day you can increase protection of your DNA from oxidative damage by 60 percent,"" Branson reports. ""He also suggests that by sipping five cups per day of green tea you can significantly lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.""

If that sounds intriguing to you, you can pick up Li's book Eat to Beat Disease for lots more information, but here to get you started is a sampling of other foods Li claims help prevent disease. Eating all of them every day is a tall order, but regularly adding as many as you can to your diet should help you stay healthy and avoid disease.

Coffee for disease-fighting flavanols Green tea for polyphenols like EGCG Mango Fresh berries Kiwi fruit for vitamin C and antioxidants Oatmeal Sourdough bread for its effect on the microbiome Hard cheeses such as Gouda, Muenster, and Camembert for vitamin K2 Leafy greens like kale, spinach, arugula, and radicchio Legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and beans for protein, fiber, iron, and vitamins and minerals Small tinned fish like sardines, mackerel, and anchovies for omega-3 fatty acids Tomato sauce for the antioxidant lycopene Extra virgin olive oil Walnuts for omega-3 fats, B vitamins, and magnesium Dark chocolate"

https://www.tomsguide.com/news/spider-man-no-way-homes-first-streaming-service-confirmed-and-its-not-disney-plus,"You can't say we didn't warn you. Spider-Man: No Way Home's streaming future has been a constant source of chatter online. It's probably the first movie in ages where digital rentals and purchases were a topic of conversation, as evidenced by the potential Spider-Man: No Way Home digital release date leak (which has yet to be confirmed).

So, to answer the question people asking about Spider-Man: No Way Home on Disney Plus? Much like ... plot points I won't spoil here, I've got some bad news. Spider-Man: No Way Home, per Deadline, is going exactly where Sony Pictures' old contracts said it would: Starz.

Yep, we're gonna have to wait a while before we can watch all the Marvel movies in order on Disney Plus.

People don't really care about contractual rights, especially when Disney and Marvel have convinced us that Disney Plus is the destination for watching all the MCU.

Yes, Starz, the app and pay cable channel that is U.S. only and not as popular as the likes of Netflix and Disney Plus. Also, before you ask, Starz is not the Star channel on Disney Plus in the U.K. and in other territories. And, oh yeah, we've got to wait longer, as it's not arriving soon, but ""sometime over the next six months."" Starz will hold it for 18 months, too.

Streaming vs Digital explained Confused about how streaming vs digital? Well, after a reader question on this topic came in over the weekend, I can say you're not alone. Digital releases (which typically come first) are the ala carte purchase/rental of a show or movie, on services such as Apple TV/iTunes and Amazon. Streaming service news refers to where a title lives inside of a regular subscription, such as Netflix, Hulu or Disney Plus.

This news makes sense considering Starz was the first streaming platform for Sony Pictures releases that dropped between from 2017 to 2021, per an older deal (and No Way Home did come out in Dec. 2021). Sony signed two deals for streaming rights in 2021, with Netflix getting films first before Disney Plus gets them afterwards.

Starz CEO Jeffrey Hirsch told Deadline about how the movie will be a boon to promoting Starz shows, saying ""you put the right shows and content around it so you can move customers that watch Spider-Man into one of your originals.""

In other Spider-Man news, a new interview has revealed that Tom Holland saw Spider-Man: No Way Home as a way to right a regret and the movie found a place in the Oscar nominations 2022.

Analysis: Disappointing but predictable

People being unaware of Starz' deal with Sony, combined with public's want to consolidate all MCU movies (and the Tom Holland-led Spider-Man movies are some of the best) into the same service, is going to lead to some upset fans. This includes Twitter user Geeks, Opinionated, which claimed that No Way Home would be going to Netflix and not Starz.

Pringus McDingus had tweeted last month that they only ""gotta wait months to see it on Disney Plus/BluRay."" And since Starz is expected to have No Way Home into 2023? That won't just be a months-long wait.

And since this was clear before this news, some users have been ready with the emotional reaction GIF of their choice, such as Courtney Lanning:

When I see No Way Home is going to Starz instead of Disney+: pic.twitter.com/ASW8MbJEa7January 7, 2022 See more

People don't really care about contractual rights, especially when Disney and Marvel have convinced us that Disney Plus is the destination for watching all the MCU.

When to expect No Way Home on Disney Plus

So if No Way Home will be on Starz in the next six months, and then spent 18 months there before going to Disney Plus?

At the earliest, this would see No Way Home on Disney Plus in the summer of 2023, if not early 2024.

And at this point, we're guessing people are going to just buy Spider-Man: No Way Home on Amazon to own it for themselves, rather than wait.

In other streaming news, the canceled TV series Criminal Minds is actually getting its reportedly-canceled revival on Paramount Plus. Plus, Super Bowl 2022 commercials are already dropping. Plus, an anticipated TV show revival is canceled at HBO Max."

https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/05/business/costco-kirkland-signature/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Costco's Kirkland Signature brand is perhaps America's weirdest private label. You can put Kirkland Signature AA batteries alongside Kirkland Signature cashews in your shopping cart.

It's also shockingly successful.

Kirkland raked in $58 billion in sales during Costco's latest fiscal year, making up around a quarter of the company's total revenue. Kirkland is America's biggest consumer packaged goods' brand measured by sales. It's larger thanor

But it wasn't always this way. It took Costco a couple decades to get its Kirkland strategy right.

If you shopped at Costco in the United States three decades ago, you'd find about 30 different Costco private-label brands alongside the big-name food and household staples' lines.

There was Simply Soda. Chelsea toilet paper. Ballantrae wine. Clout detergent. Nutra Nuggets dog food. These brands were sold only at Costco, which was called PriceCostco at the time after Price Club and Costco merged in 1993 (Costco dropped 'Price' from its name four years later).

Costco introduced the Kirkland Signature brand in 1995.

But Jim Sinegal, Costco's co-founder and CEO at the time, decided these brand names were forgettable. He sensed a major opportunity to overhaul the company's private-label strategy.

Sinegal was inspired by a 1991 article in Forbes about rising profit margins for leading consumer goods' companies at the time like General Foods, H.J. Heinz and Nabisco and the emerging growth of private-label brands. Consumers are ""starting to switch to house brands...The trend so far is only a trickle but it shows signs of growing fairly rapidly,"" the article said. Sinegal underlined key passages from the article and sent it around to Costco's top merchants.

Costco at the time was also expanding internationally, including in the United Kingdom and Canada, where stores' private-label brands were better quality and more popular with shoppers than in the United States. Most US chains' private brands had been boring, knockoff brands with white labels.

""We found that there was a resurgence of private-label product, and that was driven an awful lot by the fact that the prices of brand-name products were growing so rapidly,"" Sinegal said at a talk in 2019 at Georgetown University. Rising prices for big-name brands ""created an umbrella"" for Costco to develop its own brands at 15% to 20% below branded alternatives, he said.

Sinegal told Costco's merchants that he wanted the quality of Costco's private labels to replicate those found overseas. And he had an unusual request ‚Äî one name for all of them.

""The conventional wisdom said that you had to have a different name for every class of product that you had ‚Äî a la Sears Roebuck with the Kenmore appliances and the DieHard batteries and the Craftsman tools,"" Sinegal said in 2019. ""We looked at it and we said, you know, we're in so many countries and we have such a wide array of products we'll have a room full of attorneys that are doing nothing but trying to clear these names.""

JUST WATCHED In 2019, a Costco opened in Shanghai, China. See the chaos that ensued Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH In 2019, a Costco opened in Shanghai, China. See the chaos that ensued 01:43

Sinegal asked staff for suggestions for a name and someone floated Kirkland Signature, a spin on the location of the company's Washington State headquarters, and came to executives with a design. ( ""Seattle Signature"" was also considered , but Costco couldn't trademark the name.)

""We liked it,"" Sinegal said. ""We cleared it for every country and every product category that we would have. That made it simple.""

So in 1995, all those private brand names disappeared at Costco and were replaced by a new logo with a simple black, white and red design reading Kirkland Signature.

Although Costco soon moved its headquarters to nearby Issaquah, the Kirkland name stuck: ""Nobody could spell Issaquah, so we kept it.""

'KS'

Kirkland Signature, known as ""KS"" at Costco, would soon be slapped on everything from diapers to tires to golf clubs.

Last year, Costco introduced a 24-pack of 12oz Kirkland hard seltzer and a 750ml Prosecco ros√©. This year, Costco is adding Kirkland cauliflower pizza, furnace filters and a set of saute pans, among other items.

The sole private-label brand at Costco is an essential part of the retailer's positioning with customers and a way for Costco to stand out against competitors.

Kirkland, which is exclusive to Costco, draws members into warehouses and leads them to renew their $60 and $120 annual memberships every year. Perhaps more important to the company, Kirkland helps Costco solidify its image as a value store with quality products, say analysts.

""Kirkland is a proxy brand for Costco. It really means Costco,"" said Christopher Durham, president of Retail Brands Institute, a trade group representing the private brand industry. Kirkland is designed to appeal across demographic groups, he said, unlike many other retailers' array of private labels that are each targeted at a specific segment of shoppers.

Having one name signals consistency to shoppers ‚Äî exactly Costco's goal ‚Äî and also creates cost efficiencies for the no-frills retailer. Costco doesn't have to pay for different packaging and can put all of its buying power with suppliers behind Kirkland. A single private brand is emblematic of Costco's broader approach to merchandise at warehouses: Less choice is better.

""Kirkland has a one-note strategy and it's really good at that one note,"" Durham said. ""It creates a reason and a point of differentiation for people to shop there.""

'Don't get it wrong'

Many retailers have made developing their own brands a priority in recent years. Store products carry higher profit margins than national brand products and don't incur the same advertising costs.

But Costco's approach is novel. It's still one of the only large retail chains to carry all of its private brands under a single banner. Costco rival Sam's Club in 2017 streamlined its 21 private brands into its Member's Mark brand.

Kroger KR says in filings that it produces and sells its private brands in three ""tiers"" ‚Äî premium mainly under the Private Selection label, a middle brand called Kroger, and value brands such as Big K and Heritage Farm. Kroger also produces a natural and organic brand called Simple Truth.

Costco is unusual in its approach to developing private-label brands.

Most supermarkets take a similar tiered strategy, known as ""good, better, best,"" said Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at R5 Capital. But Costco has ""positioned Kirkland as a premium brand at value prices.""

Other retailers also sell a wider variety of labels in an effort to target different types of consumers for various products.

Walmart WMT Target TGT Amazon AMZN has more than a dozen private brands, such as Great Value household staples and George men's clothing.has dozens like Cat & Jack kids' clothing and Good & Gather food.has more than 400 different private brands , according to estimates.

Going all in on the Kirkland label remains a risk for Costco.

""Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability"" of Kirkland products is ""essential"" to keeping members loyal to Costco, the company says in its annual filings. If Kirkland ""experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence,"" sales and profit margins may suffer.

""If you get 99 things right and one thing wrong, people are going to remember the one thing. So you don't get it wrong,"" said Costco finance chief Richard Galanti. ""From an opportunity standpoint, Kirkland is known. It's a brand."""

What is Nanotechnology?





Nanotechnology is the process of understanding the unique properties of matter between 1 and 100 nanometers in size and controlling those properties and applying them to new inventions and applications. The concept of nanotechnology includes the subjects of nanotechnology, engineering and technology. Nanotechnology is important for modeling, drawing, calculating and measuring nanoscale matter. The properties of a nanoscale substance are different from those of a normal case. Increased chemical reactivity, high conductivity, and toughness play a key role. At the nanoscale, surface tension and Vanwall force are more important than gravity. Newton, proposed by Isaac Newton in the 17th century, is not valid for real nanoscale particles. The nature of nanoparticles can be explained by kwonmi theory of the 20th century. This argument discusses the wavelength and molecular number of atomic and subatomic particles.

Researchers researching these unique properties, which depend on the nanoscale, call it nanoscience, and the effective application of these features to technology is called nanotechnology.





When is Nanotechnology being used today?





Nanotechnology is widely used in commercial products and processes. Nanomaterials are used in the manufacture of lightweight tennis sticks, baseball bats, and bicycles to enhance their durability. Nanostructured crystals are used to increase the efficiency of chemical manufacturing processes, to save energy, and to prevent null side effects. Some pharmaceuticals have introduced new chemical formulas that blend nanoparticles to enhance their absorption capacity and facilitate their administration. In the manufacture of spectacles, nanoparticles are used to make the glass easier to clean and resistant to abrasion. Nano-material coatings can be applied to fabrics to produce stains that are resistant to staining.





Nano ceramics are used in dentistry to fill teeth and to fill cavities after bone marrow removal. It can be used in such a way that nanoceramic particles can adapt to the characteristics of the surrounding tissue. Nanomaterials have been used in most of the electronics manufactured over the past decade. With the widespread use of nanotechnology in 2007 and 2008, new transistors and interconnectors were developed for faster and more advanced computer chips.





How can Nanotechnology be used in the future?





Nanotechnology drugs that can achieve amazing results are currently in clinical trials. The toxins, which are needed to destroy the abnormally growing tumors in the tissues, are sent directly to the site by the nanoparticles. This can reduce the risk of damage to healthy cells. It is also used to make medical devices more secure and accurate, such as MRI and CAT scanners. Nanotechnology can produce new fuels, dry cells and solar cells to make more efficient use of energy for homes, vehicles and businesses. Scientists are trying to find nanotechnology applications to purify drinking water and to test the purity of water and to dispose of it during waste disposal.





The use of Nano-sensors in packaging will soon enable the detection of food-borne pathogens. Nano materials that are stronger, lighter and more durable than the materials currently used to make buildings, bridges and vehicles will be identified in the future.





Scientists are conducting research on the production of light refractory fabrics, which could lead to an ""invisibility cloak"" in the future.





It can be assumed that with the increase in interest in nanotechnology, innovations will be made indefinitely and in the future it will greatly affect the advancement of the world and science.





How many Nanotechnology researchers are there today?





The American National Science Foundation estimates that the nanotechnology industry worldwide will need about 2 million manpower over the next 15 years.





As in other fields of science, nanotechnology is based primarily on the processes that exist in nature. Compared to the nanotechnology applications that exist in nature, man-made inventions are still in their infancy. The energy efficiency of systems in nature is extremely high. They also minimize side effects and provide only the specific targeted product as needed. By understanding the concept of Nano, we will one day be able to create at least some of the wonders of nature and adapt it to everyday use."

https://tvline.com/2022/02/11/daredevil-jessica-jones-marvel-series-removed-from-netflix-march-2022/,"Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Netflix‚Äòs other street-level Marvel heroes are moving to a new neighborhood.

On Friday morning, the Internet took notice of the fact that a sash noting ‚ÄúThis show is available until March 1st‚Äù had been affixed to the Marvel title card of the streamer‚Äôs Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, The Defenders and The Punisher series. Oh and Iron Fist, too. Streaming TV Renewal/ Cancellation Scorecard

There is no official word yet about to where the six series‚Äô collective libraries will be moving; TVLine has inquires into Disney+ and Hulu, both of which are owned in whole or in part by Marvel owner Disney.

A source confirms that the license for Netflix has ended and the rights have reverted to Disney, which will announced its plans at a later date.

Marvel‚Äôs Daredevil ‚Äî the first of the ‚Äústreet-level heroes‚Äù to be brought to live-action, small-screen life by Netflix (and produced by the now-defunct Marvel TV) ‚Äî premiered in April 2015 and was cancelled after three seasons, in November 2018.

As our sister site Variety reported back in the day, Netflix‚Äôs deal with its four original Marvel shows (Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage included) had a clause that prevented the title characters from appearing ‚Äúin any non-Netflix series or film for at least two years after cancellation.‚Äù Sure enough, this past December ‚Äî three years after Daredevil got the axe ‚Äî series star Charlie Cox reprised his role as Matt Murdock on the big screen in Spider-Man: No Way From Home, the same week that Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio made his first ‚Äúencore‚Äù appearance on Disney+‚Äôs Hawkeye as Wilson Fisk aka Kingpin.

Jessica Jones‚Äò third season was the final batch of Netflix/Marvel episodes to premiere, in June 2019; months prior, in February 2019, Jessica Jones and The Punisher (which lasted two seasons) were the last of the bunch to get cancelled.

Where do you suspect Jessica, Luke, Matt, Danny and Frank will next call home?"
https://www.eatthis.com/best-drink-inflammation/,"From fighting off viruses and infections to repairing injuries, inflammation plays a critical role in the body's natural healing process. However, like many other things, too much of it can be harmful to your health, with chronic inflammation being linked to a range of diseases like arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes.

While eating anti-inflammatory foods is one tried-and-true way to protect your body, what you choose to drink is just as vital. Luckily, you don't need to purchase anything fancy to fend off inflammation-related health conditions. According to our medical expert board member Sydney Greene, MS, RD, the best drink for inflammation is good ol' H2O.

Read on to discover why water is the best drink for reducing inflammation. And for more healthy drinking tips, don't forget to check out The #1 Best Juice to Drink Every Day, Says Science.

How does water lower inflammation?

Inflammation can occur when the body experiences a deficiency in waste removal. That's where drinking plenty of water can help.

""One of [water's] main roles is to help the body in the natural process of detoxification,"" says Greene. ""Detoxifying and eliminating waste by going to the bathroom is one of the most fundamental ways to decrease inflammation in the body.""

Staying hydrated also helps maintain the body's fluid balance. According to Medical News Today, 80% of cartilage‚Äîwhich is tissue found in the joints and discs of the spine‚Äîis composed of water. Drinking water plays an integral role in the production of synovial fluid, which lubricates and protects the joints. Without adequate water supply, the joints lose their shock-absorbing ability, which can ultimately trigger joint friction and pain.

How much water should I drink?

You've probably heard the ""expert recommendation"" that you should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. But how much truth is there to this guideline? It depends.

How much water a person needs is dependent on multiple factors, including their diet, where they live, the weather and what season it is, how frequently they exercise, and their condition of health.

According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, men should consume approximately 15.5 cups (or 3.7 liters) of fluid per day, while women should drink 11.5 cups (or 2.7 liters) of fluid per day. However, it's important to note that this recommendation includes other beverages‚Äîsuch as juice and tea‚Äîand about 20% of one's daily fluid intake usually comes from food.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

If you're looking to take your water up a notch, Greene suggests adding citrus fruits and berries. The fruit will not only enhance the taste, but it will add a boost of antioxidants, which are celebrated for their anti-inflammatory properties.

What are some other anti-inflammatory drinks?

While water is Greene's go-to drink for lowering inflammation, green vegetable juice and turmeric tea are two beverages worth noting.

Green juice boasts a nutrient profile that's rich in vitamins, minerals, polyphenols, and antioxidants.

Similarly, turmeric is highly regarded for its inflammation-fighting antioxidants, which is why it's often nicknamed a ""superfood.""

""Curcumin, the polyphenol found in turmeric root, has been widely studied for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,"" says Greene. ""One way [curcumin fights inflammation] is by scavenging free radicals in the body."""

https://web.archive.org/web/20220217192625/https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/windows-11-unsupported-message-pc/,"If you‚Äôre running Windows 11 on an unsupported PC, then you might want to keep your eyes open for a new warning in the future. That‚Äôs because Microsoft is internally testing a new message in the Windows 11 Settings app to alert you that your system doesn‚Äôt meet the minimum requirements for the new operating system.

Twitter user and Windows leaker @thebookisclosed was the first to note this, but the good news is that it doesn‚Äôt look as though the messages might get in the way as much as the ‚ÄúWindows isn‚Äôt activated‚Äù warning and watermark might. Per the Twitter user, Microsoft‚Äôs latest preview builds just has an alert in the Windows 11 Settings app as a small ‚Äúhero‚Äù to indicate when system requirements are not met.

The alert shows up under the laptop name with a Learn More link. Clicking that link then sends you out to a Microsoft webpage that explains what happens when you install Windows 11 on devices that don‚Äôt meet minimum system requirements.

Again, this message only shows up in internal preview builds, so not everyone will be seeing it just yet, as Microsoft hasn‚Äôt rolled it out. And while it was always possible to run Windows 11 on unsupported hardware, doing so does have some risks. Microsoft doesn‚Äôt endorse it and warns of compatibility issues, as well as the fact that you won‚Äôt be entitled to receive future updates or new Windows features. This means you could be at risk for security issues like malware, spyware, and other common Windows problems.

Of course, we recently found that you might still get updates, after all, but if your system doesn‚Äôt meet the requirements for Windows 11, you might want to consider buying a new one. Or, you can try to upgrade your device‚Äôs components like the CPU or the TPM 2.0 chip just to be safe. Microsoft still has the right to stop delivering updates to your device at any time.

Windows 11 is only compatible on systems with Intel 8th-generation processors or newer processors, or AMD Ryzen 2000 series processors. This has been the main roadblock and a source of controversy for many people, along with the mandatory requirement for a TPM 2.0 chip. However, Windows 11 is still gaining steam and hit a 16.1% market share in January, per the firm AdDuplex.

A PlayStation exclusive RPG from yesteryear has been re-released, but not via the PS4 or the PS5. The PS1 was above all an RPG machine. The first PlayStation console saw the release of Final Fantasy VII, Suikoden, Chrono Trigger, and countless other classic RPGs. Of course, subsequent PlayStation machines have had their fair share of great role-playing games, but no PlayStation console is defined more by the RPGs it played than the PS1. Not every RPG on the PS1 populates the ""Top 100 RPGs of All Time"" list though. There was plenty of filler. One example of this filler was 1999's Shadow Madness, which was a PS1 exclusive when it was released and was a PS1 exclusive until yesterday when it came to PC, via Steam.

It's unclear what upgrades developer Crave Entertainment and publishers Piko Interactive and Bleem are making with the PC port, if any. It's also unclear how much it will cost, and there's no word if the game will come to other platforms.

As you may remember, Crave Entertainment was actually the publisher of the original game, with Craveyard Studios the original developer. Upon release, the game garnered mixed reviews, earning a 65 on GameRankings. In 2022, you won't find many talking about the PS1 exclusive, but perhaps the PC port will change this. And who knows, depending on how the PC port does, maybe a sequel will be made.

""All is definitely not well in the world of Arkose. The islands are falling into chaos caused by 'shadow madness,' a plague of unknown origin and dire consequence,"" reads an official pitch of the game. ""Who can possibly help before it's too late? The disease has no known cure and has no warning symptoms, making the result particularly fearsome. It turns its victims into hideous creatures that bear no resemblance to their former selves. You are the only chance that Arkose has. With intricate battle scenarios involving magic, six heroes to choose from, and many hours of engrossing gameplay, you can't help but want to fight.""

https://leedaily.com/2022/02/15/winds-of-winter-release-date-is-finally-confirmed-after-several-leaks/amp/,"Fans have gotten impatient as they await the publication date of The Winds of Winter! We‚Äôre already midway through 2021 and still waiting for the book to come out! Will George R.R. Martin‚Äôs Winds of Winter be published shortly, and what can we hope from him?

Martin notified his admirers about a journey he went to the Midwest in the latest issue on his not-blog on July 16, 2021. He returned home in June, however, the post was delayed since there was a bunch of administrative work to be done. The author finished by repeating a well-known poem by Robert Frost:

‚ÄúThe woods were lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep and books to write before I sleep.‚Äù

Is this a reference to his pledge to deliver The Winds of Winter to his fans? After everything, this year might be too much to hope for, but perhaps one day.

George R.R. Martin released an update on Winds of Winter in April 2021. The sixth novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire book series has been postponed significantly, and George has given us even more bad news. Martin acknowledged in his most recent article on George R.R. Martin‚Äôs website Not A Blog that he will not be done with the book anytime shortly.

‚ÄúI am hugely behind right now, and the prospect of trying to catch up is increasingly oppressive‚Äù, Martin wrote.

It appears that the hope of a satisfactory conclusion to the series, along with the toll of Covid-19, has produced an environment unsuitable for finishing the book.

Since about June 2021, the 71-year-old writer has confessed that he desires the books had been published sooner than the Game of Thrones series.

Martin went on to tell fans that he is thrilled to have signed a five-year Game of Thrones contract with HBO and HBO Max for completely original material.

A Song of Ice and Fire was mentioned in a 2019 post. Author George R. R. Martin explicitly authorized his followers to lock him up in a cabin on White Island if he had not completed The Winds of Winter by July 2020, when WorldCon was scheduled to take place.

Despite the in-person event in New Zealand being canceled owing to the continuing epidemic, Martin, who had provided little sign of being closer to finishing the sixth book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, seemed to have avoided that destiny.

We had no idea that the jail he had playfully mentioned would turn out to be more than a hoax. Martin stated in another blog post written on June 23, 2020, that he is no new to the cabin fever that has afflicted many of us since March. In his situation, though, the first part of the phrase is extremely literal.

Could a Cabin Be All That Is Required for the Winds of Winter to Appear on Our Racks?

Several fans have ached for Wind of Winter upgrades throughout the years, asking why Martin is taking longer than expected to complete it. George R. R. Martin notified fans that he had been undergoing quarantine in a real cabin, which they could not have predicted a few months ago‚Ä¶ and it appears that something positive may have sprung from it.

While somewhat sick of living alone, the 71-year-old novelist noted that he maintains a regular, if somewhat monotonous, schedule and strives to remain fit. This appears to be now paying off.

Martin had much time to be spent with his characters now that most hassles had been gone and international travel had been replaced by Zoom calls.

As of June 2020, he was concentrating on Cersei and Tyrion Lannister, Ser Barristan Selmy, Asha Greyjoy (known as Yara in the HBO TV series), and Areo Hotah, the leader of the Martell guard. Arya Stark was also addressed, and she, as usual, aims to murder somebody.

Martin Teased the Release of Winds of Winter in 2021

While Martin has yet to regain his amazing writing rate from the late 1990s when he started on the series‚Äô third installment, A Storm of Swords, generating approximately 150 pages every month, fans can still rejoice.

The author expressed regret over his postponed trip to Wellington. Nonetheless, he stated his plan to return in 2021, when he thinks ‚Äúboth Covid-19 and The Winds of Winter will be completed.‚Äù

Rumors have lately flooded the internet, claiming that The Winds of Winter will be published in November 2023, as allegedly revealed by the writer. But, Martin‚Äôs website makes no mention of such a breach, and there is no authoritative source that does. If the author has made a public comment on a new release date, he should have done so discreetly.

Furthermore, even for well-known authors, predicting a thorough publication timeframe is difficult when the novel isn‚Äôt even near to completion. Edits will almost certainly be required after the manuscript is submitted. Only after the manuscript has been officially finalized can we start the countdown to the book‚Äôs arrival on our shelves."

https://healthclubfinder.org/woman-cured-of-hiv/,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is still one of the world‚Äôs most serious public health challenges. Caused by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), it spreads through blood. The virus mainly attacks the white blood cells and weakens the immune system of the human body.

If HIV is not treated, it can lead to an advanced stage of HIV infection: AIDS. The weak immune system becomes susceptible to opportunistic infections‚Äîwhich can lead to death.

According to the WHO (World Health Organization), there are about 37.9 million people globally living with HIV in 2018.

In 2020, we all know many people died from the global pandemic Coronavirus, but apart from this, do you know that thousands of people suffered from HIV.

As per WHO data, ‚Äú680 000 [480 000‚àí1.0 million] people died of HIV-related illnesses worldwide in 2020.‚Äù

Though HIV is incurable, recently, a woman has been cured of this virus completely!

How‚Äôs even that possible?

Yes, a Woman cured of HIV!

A middle-aged woman of mixed race who is currently a US resident has become the first woman and the third person in the world to be cured of HIV to date!

She is treated with a stem cell transplant which was donated by a person with natural resistance to the virus that causes AIDS.

In a presentation at Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in the US on Tuesday, the researchers confirmed that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 14 months, and she is now free from the virus!‚Äù

Despite the cessation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the woman hasn‚Äôt reported any detectable levels of HIV to date.

According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ‚ÄúThe woman was actually a part of a study that began in 2015 designed to monitor outcomes of 25 people with HIV in the U.S. who underwent a transplant.‚Äù

In 2013, she was diagnosed with HIV, and ever since, she had been on antiretroviral drugs. In March 2017, she was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukaemia. Later in the year, around August, she was treated with a mutation-containing cord blood transplant, also known as Cold Cord Treatment.

Marshall Glesby, an infectious diseases expert at Weill Cornell Medicine, who was also a part of the team, told in an interview with New York Times, ‚ÄúThe transplant from the relative is like a bridge that got her through to the point of the cord blood being able to take over,‚Äù

Source: thequint.com

However, that‚Äôs not the first case of this. Other than this woman, two other people, both men, are also known to have been cured of HIV. The first person is known as the ‚ÄúBerlin patient,‚Äù who lived virus-free for 12 years. However, later in September 2020, he died of leukaemia. Another person was from the UK, who had received a bone-marrow transplant, and since 2016 he is also living virus-free.

With Antiretroviral therapy (ART), people with HIV can live a near-normal life. However, it‚Äôs still not widely available to the public.

According to UNAIDS, ‚Äú37.7 million people were living with HIV in 2020 worldwide. Only 28.2 million of them had access to antiretroviral therapy.‚Äù

With this new approach of stem transplant, researchers want to find a cure in the form of a vaccine or drug that can kick the virus out of the body. According to researchers, if the success rates increase with this new approach, this treatment will be available to more people.

During an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday, March 9, the Knives Out star, 71, revealed his daughter‚Äôs reaction to being removed from his ‚Äúpayroll.‚Äù

Don explained to host Seth Meyers, ‚ÄúWe have a rule in the family that, you know, if you stay in school, you get to stay on the payroll. So, you go to college, you get to stay on the payroll. Toward the end of high school, I went to [Dakota] and I said, ‚ÄòSo, do you want to go visit some colleges?‚Äô Or something like that. And she was like, ‚ÄòOh, no. I‚Äôm not going to college.'‚Äù

The Django Unchained star continued, ‚ÄúI went, ‚ÄòOK, you know what that means? You don‚Äôt be on the payroll anymore,'‚Äù noting that he asked the Fifty Shades of Gray star how she was ‚Äúgoing to manage‚Äù without him supporting her. She replied with, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù and declined to offer up any details about her plans.

According to Don, three weeks after that conversation, Dakota, 31, was cast in The Social Network.

‚ÄúAnd the rest is, shall we say, cinema history,‚Äù he said.

Don told Meyers, 47, that Dakota has found her own way in Hollywood. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt really call me for advice,‚Äù he shared. ‚ÄúShe calls me to say, ‚ÄòGosh, I would see you, but I‚Äôve got three pictures that I‚Äôm shooting at the same time.'‚Äù

While the Missouri native had strict rules for his kids and their finances, Dakota‚Äôs mom, Melanie Griffith, focused more on fun. In January, Dakota revealed during an appearance on The Late Late Show With James Corden that her mom took her to get her belly button pierced when she was 14.

Griffith, 63, also brought her daughter to get her first tattoo ‚Äî even after Don told Dakota he would disown her if she got one. ‚ÄúNow I didn‚Äôt know this, and I was surprised to find this out today, that you are a big fan of tattoos. I mean I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm surprised,‚Äù James Corden said during the show.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre surprised either,‚Äù Johnson replied before revealing that she has 11 or 12 different tattoos, which she called ‚Äúconservative.‚Äù

Don and Griffith were married for six months in 1976. Dakota is the only child they share, though both have kids from other relationships. The Miami Vice alum is father to Jesse, 38, Grace, 21, Jasper, 18, and Deacon, 14. Griffith, meanwhile, is a mom to Alexander, 35, and Stella, 24. She shares Stella with ex-husband Antonio Banderas, whom she was married to from 1996 to 2015.

Meanwhile, new games in series like Final Fantasy and Metal Gear Solid were exclusive to the console. In fact, the best-selling game on the console, GTA San Andreas, was exclusive to the PS2 when it was first released. Not everything that released during this era was legendary though. There were also games like Bloodrayne and Bloodrayne 2, which had their fans, but not to the same extent. That said, it's this pair of games that were stealth-released on the PS5 today.

More specifically, remasters of the pair games -- which were released on PS4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One back on November 18 -- are now available on PS5 natively. Previously, they were only available to play on PS5 via backward compatibility. Developed by Big Boat Interactive and published by Ziggurat Interactive, the remasters boost the resolution of the game, upscale the cinematics, make engine improvements, and more.

As for the original games, the series began in 2002 -- via developer Terminal Reality and publisher Majesco Entertainment -- with the release of the eponymous game (Bloodrayne). Upon release, the game received Metacritic scores ranging in the 70s across all platforms minus PC. In other words, the game wasn't a huge critical success nor a huge commercial success, but it did get a sequel in 2004, Bloodrayne 2. The sequel had a similar critical and commercial performance.

At the moment of publishing, there's no word of the pair of games coming to Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, making the pair of games a current-gen exclusive for the PS5, at least for the moment.

https://www.otgnewz.com/2022/02/with-enzyme-therapy-organs-can-now-be.html,"OTTAWA: If a healthy person donates an organ to a patient, there are a number of complications in which one person cannot be donated to another due to different blood groups. Now, thanks to enzyme therapy, even complex organs can be implanted in people with different blood groups.

After many years of hard work by scientists in Canada, an enzyme treatment has been devised that will allow a single organ to be safely transplanted to patients of a worldwide blood type.

Now whether it is a blood transfusion or a transplant, if the blood type is not the same, the matter can be complicated. If an organ belonging to a different group is implanted in this way, then the body first becomes its enemy and rejects it.

To solve this, a team of scientists used enzymes to remove antigen from a donated organ. In this way the condition of the organ becomes 'Universal O Group'. Two enzymes for therapy are taken from the human intestine, namely, FPGEL, NACD, ACE Tiles, and FPGalactozamide.

Scientists placed two lungs inside the X-Wave Ling Perfusion system. In this system, the lungs are kept alive in blood and essential components before transplantation. Now both enzymes have been added to it.

The experiment involved a type A donor lung that was already damaged and had been rejected by doctors for treatment. When two enzymes were inserted into the EVLP system, the antigen (blood group) and its effects disappeared by 97% from the whole organ shortly after. Now that it has been placed in blood of the opposite blood group, the lung-rejecting ingredients have not been found.

The experiment showed that enzyme therapy could sooner or later help transplant organs from people of different blood groups."

https://www.engadget.com/qanon-machine-learning-205618665.html,"With help from machine learning software, computer scientists may have unmasked the identity of Q, the founder of the QAnon movement. In a sprawling report published on Saturday, The New York Times shared the findings of two independent teams of forensic linguists who claim they‚Äôve identified Paul Furber, a South African software developer who was one of the first to draw attention to the conspiracy theory, as the original writer behind Q. They say Arizona congressional candidate Ron Watkins also wrote under the pseudonym, first by collaborating with Furber and then later taking over the account when it eventually moved to post on his father‚Äôs 8chan message board.

The two teams of Swiss and French researchers used different methodologies to come to the same conclusion. The Swiss one, made up of two researchers from startup OrphAnalytics , used software to break down Q‚Äôs missives into patterns of three-character sequences. They then tracked how often those sequences repeated. The French team, meanwhile, trained an AI to look for patterns in Q‚Äôs writing. Both techniques broadly fall under an approach known as stylometry that looks to analyze writing in a way that is measurable, consistent and replicable. To avoid the possibility of confusing their respective programs, the teams limited their analysis to social media posts. Among all the other possible authors they put through the test, they say the writing of Furber and Watkins stood out the most for how similar it was that of Q‚Äôs.

And they‚Äôre confident in that identification. The French team made of computational linguists Florian Cafiero and Jean-Baptiste Camps told The Times their software correctly identified Furber‚Äôs writing in 98 percent of tests and Watkins‚Äô in 99 percent. ‚ÄúAt first most of the text is by Furber,‚Äù said Cafiero. ‚ÄúBut the signature of Ron Watkins increased during the first few months as Paul Furber decreased and then dropped completely.‚Äù

People have previously used machine learning software to identify Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling as the secret writer of Cuckoo‚Äôs Calling, a 2013 crime fiction novel Rowling wrote under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. More broadly, law enforcement agencies have successfully used stylometry in a variety of criminal cases, including by the FBI to show that Ted Kaczynski was the Unabomber.

Experts The Times spoke to ‚Äì including Professor Patrick Juola, the computer scientist who identified Rowling as the author of Cuckoo‚Äôs Calling ‚Äì told they found the findings credible and persuasive. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs really powerful is the fact that both of the two independent analyses showed the same overall pattern,‚Äù Juola said.

Both Furber and Watkins deny they wrote any of Q‚Äôs messages. ‚ÄúI am not Q,‚Äù the latter told The Times. Furber, meanwhile, said he was influenced by Q‚Äôs posts to change the style of his prose, a claim linguistic experts told the outlet was ‚Äúimplausible.‚Äù Also worth mentioning is the fact the analysis included tweets from Furber that date from the earliest days of Q‚Äôs existence.

What happens next is unclear. The researchers who worked on the identification told The Times they hope unmasking Q will loosen QAnon‚Äôs hold on people. Spreading like wildfire on social media, the conspiracy theory has had a profound effect on politics in the US and other parts of the world. And while Q hasn‚Äôt posted a new message since the end of 2020, that hasn‚Äôt dampened people‚Äôs enthusiasm for conspiracies about the ""deep state"" and its involvement in their lives."

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-lab-leak-hypothesis-made-it-harder-for-scientists-to-seek-the-truth/,"Whenever scientific findings threaten people‚Äôs sense of control over their lives, conspiracy theories are never far behind. The emergence of novel viruses is no exception. New pathogens have always been accompanied by conspiracy theories about their origin. These claims are often exploited and amplified‚Äîand sometimes even created‚Äîby political actors. In the 1980s the Soviet KGB mounted a massive disinformation campaign about AIDS, claiming that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had created HIV as part of a biological weapons research program. This campaign benefited from a ‚Äúscientific‚Äù article written by two East German scientists that ostensibly ruled out a natural, African origin of the virus, an explanation favored by Western scientists that has since been unambiguously established. In African countries, where many scientists and politicians considered the hypothesis of an African origin of AIDS to be racist, the disinformation campaign fell on fertile ground. Ultimately the conspiracy theory was picked up by Western media and became firmly entrenched in the U.S. Similarly, when the Zika virus was spreading in 2016 and 2017, social media was awash in claims that it had been designed as a bioweapon.

From the beginning, the genomic evidence led most virologists who were investigating SARS-CoV-2 to favor a zoonotic origin involving a jump of the virus from bats to humans, possibly with the help of an intermediate host animal. But considering the anxiety-provoking upheavals of the pandemic, it came as no surprise that the virus inspired conspiratorial thinking. Some of these theories‚Äîsuch as the idea that 5G broadband rather than a virus causes COVID or that the pandemic is a hoax‚Äîare so absurd that they are easily dismissed. But some theories came with a patina of plausibility. Speculation that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was engineered in the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China was facilitated by the physical location of the institute: it is right across the Yangtze River from the Huanan market where many of the earliest cases of COVID were detected. The Chinese government‚Äôs denial that markets sold live wild animals also roused suspicion, even though such wares were always suspected and have since been confirmed.

The so-called lab-leak hypothesis gained sufficient rhetorical and political force that President Joe Biden instructed the U.S. intelligence services to investigate it. Although the interagency intelligence report update, declassified in October 2021, dismissed several popular laboratory-origin claims‚Äîincluding that the virus was a bioweapon and that the Chinese government knew about the virus before the pandemic‚Äîit was unable to unequivocally resolve the origin question.

Does this mean that proponents of the lab-leak hypothesis uncovered a genuine conspiracy that will be revealed by persistent examination? Or is the lab-leak rhetoric rooted in conspiracy theories fueled by anxiety over China‚Äôs increasing prominence on the world stage or in preexisting hostility to biotechnology and fear over biosecurity? And what is it about the conditions of the past two years that made it so difficult to know?

Zoonotic Origins

The ostensible lab-leak hypothesis is not a single identifiable theory but a loose constellation of diverse possibilities held together by the common theme that Chinese science institutions‚Äîbe it the WIV or some other arm of the Chinese government‚Äîare to blame for the pandemic. At one end is the straightforward possibility of WIV lab personnel being infected during fieldwork or while culturing viruses in the lab. Scientifically, this possibility is challenging to disentangle from a zoonotic origin that followed other pathways and is therefore difficult to rule out or confirm. At the other extreme are the assertions that SARS-CoV-2 was designed and engineered by the WIV, perhaps as a bioweapon, and was released either accidentally or as a biological attack. This possibility necessarily entails a conspiracy among WIV scientists‚Äîand potentially many others‚Äîto first engineer a virus and then cover up its release. Scientific investigation of the genomic and phylogenetic evidence can help us determine whether SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of a subgenus of the betacoronaviruses called the sarbecoviruses, named after their prototype member, SARS-CoV-1, which caused the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. The zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-1 has been firmly established by research that also showed that the bat sarbecoviruses pose a clear and present danger of pandemic overspill from bats to humans.

One key feature of sarbecoviruses is that they undergo extensive amounts of recombination. Parts of their genomes are being regularly swapped at a rate that implies a vast ecosystem of these viruses is circulating, most of which have not been discovered. The area of the genome that is most likely to recombine is also the area that encodes the ‚Äúspike‚Äù proteins‚Äîthe very proteins that play a crucial role in initiating an infection. Many sarbecoviruses encode spike proteins that can bind to a wide range of mammalian cells, suggesting that these viruses can easily move back and forth between different species of mammals, including humans.

SARS-CoV-2 is not as virulent as SARS-CoV-1, but it is transmitted far more easily between people. Two of the most prominent features of the SARS-CoV-2 spike are its receptor-binding domain (RBD), which binds very tightly to human ACE2, the protein that allows it to enter lung cells, and the so-called furin cleavage site (FCS). This site divides the spike protein into subunits. The FCS is present in many other coronaviruses, but so far SARS-CoV-2 is the only sarbecovirus known to include it. It allows the viral spike protein to be cut in half during its release from an infected cell, priming the virus to spread to new cells more efficiently.

The RBD and FCS are central to initial virological arguments by expert proponents of the lab-leak hypothesis. Such arguments are based on the supposition that neither the RBD nor the FCS ‚Äúappears natural‚Äù and therefore that they can only be the product of lab-based engineering or selection. Nobel laureate David Baltimore, an early proponent of the lab-leak hypothesis, referred to the FCS as a ‚Äúsmoking gun‚Äù that points to a lab origin.

Although an unusual feature of a virus can legitimately stimulate further inquiry, this argument is reminiscent of the creationist claim that humans must have been ‚Äúintelligently designed‚Äù because we are seemingly too complex to have evolved by natural selection alone. This logic is fundamentally flawed because complexity does not license dismissal of the overwhelming evidence for natural selection and, by itself, does not mandate any design, intelligent or otherwise. Likewise, labeling the RBD or the FCS ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù does not mandate lab-based engineering, and, critically, it does not license the dismissal of the growing evidence for a zoonotic origin.

Recently, for example, bat colonies on the border between Laos and China were discovered to carry sarbecoviruses that have RBDs almost identical to those of SARS-CoV-2 in both sequence and ability to enter human cells. This finding refutes the claim that SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs binding affinity in humans is unlikely to have a natural origin.

Similarly, although some lab-leak proponents contend that the lack of an FCS in the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 is indicative of its manual insertion in a lab, very recent evidence from SARS-CoV-2 population sequencing suggests that the insertion of new sequences from human genes next to the FCS can be detected. Moreover, the closest relative of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in the Laotian bat viruses would require the addition of only a single amino acid to generate a putative FCS. Thus, in a species where it would have a major selective advantage, it would probably be very easy for some of these bat coronaviruses to rapidly evolve an FCS.

This research sketches a clear zoonotic path to the emergence of the RBD and FCS. Although some evolutionary gaps along this path persist, their number and size have been dwindling. A detailed analysis in late 2021 further strengthened the link to the Huanan markets as the point of origin of the virus and the initial source of community transmission. This rapidly growing body of evidence for a zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 creates increasing difficulties for the lab-engineering hypothesis.

Conspiratorial Cognition

In normal scientific inquiry, as evidence emerges, the remaining space for plausible hypotheses narrows. Some facets continue to be supported, and others are contradicted and eventually precluded altogether. Some of the strongest advocates for a lab origin for SARS-CoV-2 changed their views as they learned more. Baltimore, for instance, withdrew his ‚Äúsmoking gun‚Äù comment when challenged by additional evidence, conceding that a natural origin was also possible. Revising or rejecting failed hypotheses in light of refuting evidence is central to the scientific process. Not so with conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. One of their hallmarks is that they are self-sealing: as more evidence against the conspiracy emerges, adherents keep the theory alive by dismissing contrary evidence as further proof of the conspiracy, creating an ever more elaborate and complicated theory.

There is perhaps no better example of self-sealing cognition than the contortions of climate change denial that erupted after the 2009 ‚ÄúClimategate‚Äù controversy. At that time thousands of documents and e-mails were stolen from the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia in England and made public right before the United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen. The e-mails were cherry-picked by deniers for sound bites that, when taken out of context, seemed to point to malfeasance by scientists. Ultimately nine independent inquiries around the world cleared the scientists of misconduct, and nine of the warmest years ever measured have occurred in the 11 years since Climategate.

Undeterred by the exonerations, climate deniers‚Äîincluding at least one U.S. congressperson‚Äîbranded the inquiries as a ‚Äúwhitewash.‚Äù The volume of activity on skeptics‚Äô Web sites relating to the hacked e-mails continued to increase for at least four years, long after the public had lost all interest in the confected scandal. It was only in late 2021 that one of the principals making unfounded accusations against the scientists apologized for his role.

The e-mails were publicly misrepresented as a result of an unsolved hack, but top scientists and health officials also have seen their correspondence become public through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by groups with long histories of attacking scientists. The organization U.S. Right to Know honed its FOIA tactics against food scientists before turning its sights on virologists.* Despite e-mails clearly showing virologists considering but ultimately rejecting various claims about SARS-CoV-2 being engineered, lab-leak proponents tend to selectively quote messages. They cast virologists as either never having given lab scenarios fair consideration or‚Äîon the other extreme‚Äîbelieving in a lab origin all along and deliberately lying about it. People who push conspiracy theories often toggle between opposing claims as the rhetorical need arises.

Another e-mail-centered theory turned on the idea that the WIV had originally housed viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, presumably including the natural virus from which it had been engineered. The theory further held that the WIV suspiciously delayed publication of a paper that had been submitted in October 2019 until 2020. At some point after the paper‚Äôs submission with the ‚Äútrue‚Äù sequences, the argument went, the WIV halted its publication and altered the sequence information in furtherance of the cover-up.

Another FOIA effort was marshaled to reveal the discrepancy between the ‚Äúreal‚Äù sequences submitted to the journal and those that were pawned off on the unsuspecting public. Unfortunately for this conspiracy claim, the FOIA results revealed that the submitted paper‚Äôs sequences were exactly what the scientists publicly said they were. The self-sealing nature of conspiratorial reasoning being what it is, however, some proponents of the lab-leak hypothesis remain undeterred and believe the ‚Äúreal‚Äù sequences must exist in some as yet undocumented draft created before the submitted version.

The self-sealing dynamic can produce even more elaborate epicycles to resist falsification. Until earlier this year, the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 was a virus called RaTG13, which is known to have been held by the WIV in a collection of bat swab samples. RaTG13 is more than 96 percent identical to SARS-CoV-2. It is likely that this virus genome was sequenced from a swab taken in 2013 from bats in an abandoned mine shaft in Mojiang, a county in China‚Äôs Yunnan province. RaTG13‚Äôs centrality to many lab-leak claims stemmed from its putative role as the ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù from which SARS-CoV-2 was allegedly engineered.

Being closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and being present in the lab at the WIV made RaTG13 a perfect candidate for a precursor that was engineered into SARS-CoV-2. In the short time since the pandemic took hold, however, several related viruses have been discovered that are closer in sequence to SARS-CoV-2 over much of the genome. Moreover, despite being related to SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 has been found to occupy a separate phylogenetic branch. SARS-CoV-2 is not descended from RaTG13; rather the viruses share a common ancestor from which they diverged an estimated 40 to 70 years ago, meaning it could not have served as a backbone for an engineered SARS-CoV-2.

Rather than accepting this contrary evidence, some lab-leak advocates resorted to self-sealing reasoning that deviates from standard scientific practice: They began to argue that RaTG13 was not a natural virus itself but rather had been edited or in some way fabricated in an effort to hide the ‚Äútrue‚Äù backbone of SARS-CoV-2 and thus its engineered nature. The virus from Laos showing that SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs RBD and the efficiency of its binding to human receptors are not unique‚Äîproviding strong support for a zoonotic origin‚Äîis thus reinterpreted to mean that the WIV obtained and used a similar but so far secret virus from Laos to design SARS-CoV-2. This ad hoc hypothesis is accompanied by the expectation that the burden is on the WIV to prove it did not have that secret virus‚Äîa reversal of the expected burden of proof that runs counter to conventional scientific reasoning.

Such pivots are potentially immune to further evidence. Just as there are effectively unlimited ‚Äúgaps‚Äù between transitional fossils that are exploited by creationists, so, too, are there effectively unlimited potential natural viruses from which SARS-CoV-2 must have been engineered that have been kept hidden by the WIV. Or else unnatural viruses the WIV might have engineered to make SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs features seem naturally evolved.

More and more relatives and antecedents of SARS-CoV-2 are bound to be discovered, and adherents of the lab-leak hypothesis will face a stark choice. They can abandon, or at least qualify, their belief in genetic engineering, or they must generate an ever increasing number of claims that these relatives and antecedents, too, have been fabricated or engineered. It is likely that at least some people will follow the latter path of motivated reasoning, insisting that secretive Chinese machinations or an unnatural manipulation of biology is responsible for the virus‚Äôs origin.

Motivated reasoning based on blaming an ‚Äúother‚Äù is a powerful force against scientific evidence. Some politicians‚Äîmost notably former President Donald Trump and his entourage‚Äîstill push the lab-leak hypothesis and blame China in broad daylight. When Trump baldly pointed the finger at China in the earliest days of the pandemic, unfortunate consequences followed. The proliferation of xenophobic rhetoric has been linked to a striking increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. It has also led to a vilification of the WIV and some of its Western collaborators, as well as partisan attempts to defund certain types of research (such as ‚Äúgain of function‚Äù research) that are linked with the presumed engineering of SARS-CoV-2. There are legitimate arguments about the regulation, acceptability and safety of doing gain-of-function research with pathogens. But conflating these concerns with the fevered discussion of the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is unhelpful. These examples show how a relatively narrow conspiracy theory can expand to endanger entire groups of people and categories of scientific research‚Äîjeopardizing both lives and lifesaving science.

A Long Tail

Scientists no longer debate the fact that greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are changing Earth‚Äôs climate. Although this scientific consensus on climate change was established 20 years ago, it has never stopped influential politicians from calling climate change a hoax. Climate denial is a well-organized disinformation campaign to confuse the public in pursuit of a clear policy goal‚Äînamely, to delay climate mitigation.

The markers of conspiratorial cognition are universal, whether the subject is climate denial, antivaccination propaganda or conspiracies surrounding the origin of SARS-CoV-2. It is critical to help the media and the public identify those markers. Unlike the overwhelming evidence for climate change, however, a zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is likely but not yet conclusive. This is not a sign of nefarious activity and is, in fact, entirely unsurprising: It took 10 years to pin down the zoonotic source of SARS-CoV-1. The Zaire Ebola virus has never been isolated from bats, despite strong serological evidence that they are the likely reservoir.

Plausible routes for a lab origin do exist‚Äîbut they differ from the engineering-based hypotheses that most lab-leak rhetoric relies on. The lab in Wuhan could be a relay point in a zoonotic chain in which a worker became infected while sampling in the field or being accidentally contaminated during an attempt to isolate the virus from a sample. Evidence for these possibilities may yet emerge and represents a legitimate line of inquiry that proponents of a natural origin and lab-leak theorists should be able to agree on. But support for those claims will not be found in self-sealing reasoning, quote mining of e-mails or baseless suggestions. Ironically the xenophobic instrumentalization of the lab-leak hypothesis may have made it harder for reasonable scientific voices to suggest and explore theories because so much time and effort has gone into containing the fallout from conspiratorial rhetoric.

Lessons from climate science show that failure to demarcate conspiratorial reasoning from scientific investigation results in public confusion, insufficient action from leadership, and the harassment of scientists. It even has the potential to impact research itself, as scientists are diverted into knocking back incorrect claims and, in the process, potentially ceding them more legitimacy than warranted.

We must anticipate that this type of dangerous distraction will continue. Scientists identified with COVID research are suffering abuse, including death threats. When the Omicron variant emerged, so did nonsensical conspiracy theories that it, too, was an escaped, human-altered virus, originating from the lab in South Africa that first reported it. One can only assume that further variants may likewise be blamed on whichever research lab is closest to the location of discovery. We are not doomed to keep repeating the mistakes of past intersections of science and conspiracy should we choose to learn from them instead.

With McGregor‚Äôs buses, clothes, and accessories, one might assume that doing MMA is a great way to get rich. While this is clearly true for established stars like McGregor, utmost fighters find themselves in dire woe at the onset of their careers.





This was true of McGregor as well. In fact, just before knocking out Marcus Brimage in his UFC debut, McGregor was forced to take a social weal cheque. Going from the weal line to a likely$ 100 million payday in a matter of times is an amazing and inspiring story which has earned McGregor suckers around the world.









5). He Was an Armature Boxing Champion.

Detractors who have raised their opposition to McGregor‚Äôs forthcoming fight with Mayweather have constantly refocused out McGregor‚Äôs lack of boxing experience. While this is a valid point, McGregor does have licit amateur boxing experience.





Before he fanned out into other martial trades like Karate and BJJ, McGregor was an incredibly successful amateur prizefighter. He indeed came the All-Ireland Champion as a youth prizefighter. He'll clearly need to use every second of boxing experience he'd in order to master Mayweather in August.





















6). He Was a Plumber.





Casual Suckers might suppose that McGregor is nothing but a brash and arrogant athlete. Those who have followed his career more nearly, still, understand that he uses trash talk to promote fights. He's actually a down-to- earth person who appreciates everything he has because he came from humble onsets.

Long before reaching the zenith of MMA, McGregor was working as a plumber apprentice. He snappily realized that his passion for fighting was too strong to ignore and gave up the trade.

7). He Won a Fight in Just 4 Second.





Winning fights by knockout in the first round has come a career- defining trend for McGregor. Still, some of his knockouts have been nearly too fast to believe. Anyone who looked away while watching McGregor‚Äôs fight against Patrick Doherty in 2011 likely missed all the action. It took him only 4 seconds to land two ruinous punches and knock his opponent out.

















8). He Predicts his Success.





McGregor famously began directly prognosticating the round in which he'd finish his opponents. Still, times before he came a UFC megastar, McGregor made one of his most emotional prognostications.

A videotape promo captured a youthful Conor McGregor stating that he'd one day come an undisputed UFC Champion. Despite being only five fights into his career at the time, he ever had an accurate vision of his after career.













9). He Supports Gay Rights.





Given his unknown fashionability, one might assume that McGregor would wince down from taking stations on controversial motifs like gay marriage. Still, he's not the type of person to stay silent when he believes commodity must be done. In fact, McGregor came one of the most notorious Irish celebrities to be oral in support of gay marriage. He said that at the end of the day, it comes down to the fact that we're all mortal and earn respect.

10). He Fights at any Weight.





As bandied over, every fighter deserves respect for having the courage to put their health on the line and step into the pen. Still, there are a select many fighters who also have the courage to transcend weight classes.

McGregor is one of these exceptional athletes. He doesn't watch which weight class an opponent is in; if the fight is seductive, he ‚Äôll take it. He has fought everyplace from Featherweight to Welterweight in the UFC, a 25-pound range.

https://atticcapital.com/rare-buffalo-nickels/,"Few U.S. coins are more prized, romanticized, and searched for than the rare buffalo nickels. This unique artifact of the 20th century is the target of avid collectors more than a century after it was first minted. So how did the buffalo nickel come into being, and which versions of it are the most valuable?

A Brief History of Rare Buffalo Nickels

The U.S. Mint began to produce five-cent nickel pieces shortly after the Civil War. New coinage was sorely needed in the states, and nickel was much more plentiful than gold and silver.

Original five-cent pieces, or shield nickels, were produced from 1866 to 1883. They featured a rather intricate, frilly shield on the ‚Äúheads‚Äù side. On the reverse was a stars-and-beams celebration of the number ‚Äú5,‚Äù a complex design that the U.S. Mint‚Äôs stamping machines eventually couldn‚Äôt handle.

In 1883, chief engraver Charles Barber designed the Liberty nickel or Liberty Head nickel. This piece, featuring the ever-popular Lady Liberty on the head‚Äôs side, went into circulation in 1883 and was minted for 30 years. The five-cent coin is also known as the V Nickel because of the eye-catching ‚ÄúV‚Äù (the Roman numeral for 5) stamped on the tails side.

Buffalo Nickel Evolving Design

In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt lodged some complaints about the design of coins in current circulation. The nickel couldn‚Äôt be immediately redesigned because of a Congressional act passed in 1890, preventing new designs on existing coins for 25 years after original minting.

Finally, in 1912, the U.S. Mint commissioned sculptor James Earle Fraser to develop some new styles for the five-cent piece.

The design that received the best response featured sketches of the head of a Native American and an American bison. Production began in 1913 at the Denver, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Mint operations. It was minted for 25 years.

In 1938, the buffalo nickel gave way to the Jefferson nickel, the design that‚Äôs still in circulation today.

Design Elements of Rare Buffalo Nickels

James E. Fraser used real-life models in the proof coins for the buffalo nickel. The Native American portrait on the obverse was a composite of three Native American chiefs who had posed for Fraser‚Äôs work in the past: Big John Tree of the Seneca Nation, Iron Tail of the Sioux, and Two Moons of the Cheyenne. It‚Äôs a rather striking profile.

The heads side of the buffalo nickel originally featured a date stamp just beneath the neck of the chief, along with the inscription ‚ÄúLIBERTY‚Äù arced along the top-right area of the coin.

On the reverse side of the nickel is an image of the American bison, commonly known as the buffalo. It‚Äôs widely thought that Fraser based this image on a buffalo named Black Diamond who lived in the Central Park Zoo in New York City. The buffalo stands atop a somewhat nondescript mound of dirt on the coin.

The words ‚ÄúUNITED STATES OF AMERICA‚Äù are inscribed in an arc along the top edge of the coin, with the phrase ‚ÄúE PLURIBUS UNUM‚Äù scrunched in just beneath the right side. The denomination ‚ÄúFIVE CENTS‚Äù appears in a straight line just under the dirt mound.

Most Valuable Buffalo Nickels

1913 Liberty Head V Nickel ‚Äì $3,737,000

1918 7-D Buffalo Nickel ‚Äì $350,700

1926 S Buffalo Nickel ‚Äì $322,000

1916 Buffalo Nickel ‚Äì $282,000

1913 D Buffalo Nickel ‚Äì $143,500

1917 S Buffalo Nickel ‚Äì $138,000

1920 D Buffalo Nickel ‚Äì $138,000

1867 Shield Nickel ‚Äì $132,000

1918 S Buffalo Nickel ‚Äì $125,000

1927 S Buffalo Nickel ‚Äì $125,500

There are a few key dates in the minting of rare buffalo nickels that coin collectors keep an eye out for. Let‚Äôs break down the most significant designs corresponding to those years.

1913-S Type 2

The first buffalo nickel featured a Native American profile on the head‚Äôs side. On the reverse of the coin, it showed an American bison standing pensively atop a raised mound of dirt, with the phrase ‚ÄúFIVE CENTS‚Äù depicted along the bottom.

The problem with the first coin was that the phrase seemed to wear away rather quickly. It was stamped flat underneath the mound of dirt, with no apparent separation between the design elements.

The second series of the buffalo nickel fixed this problem by inserting a ridge just below the dirt and recessing the denomination. These features, along with the rim of the coin, prevented the ‚ÄúFIVE CENTS‚Äù phrase from erosion.

All the U.S. Mints produced the 1913 varieties, but those minted in San Francisco (identified with the ‚ÄúS‚Äù mint mark on the tails side) are considered the rarest and most valuable.

1915-S Buffalo Nickel

For higher-grade examples, the 1915-S Buffalo Nickel coin values range from $50 to over $1,000. Uncirculated high graded coins are extremely rare, but overall, circulated coins are just as challenging to find.

Out of the 1.5 million 1915-S buffalo nickels minted, only about 6,000 are estimated to have survived.

1916/16 Doubled Die Variety

In 1916, the Philadelphia U.S. Mint experienced a fault in its production process. This caused the date stamp on the obverse to appear ‚Äúdoubled.‚Äù

On a 1916 double die buffalo nickel, you can see the ‚Äú916‚Äù digits of the date replicated as a sort of shadow of the main date. The error was caught, and production resumed with a readable date after only a few hundred double die coins were minted.

Minting errors, of course, command extreme attention from rare coin collectors. This makes the 1916/16 buffalo nickel one of the most sought-after, valuable coins in the entire series.

Even lower-grade 1916/16 coins can fetch a few thousand dollars on the market, while coins in uncirculated condition are worth upwards of $100,000.

1918-D 8 Over 7

Another production mistake happened at the U.S. Mint in Denver in 1918. In this mishap, the 1918 date stamp appeared superimposed over the year 1917 ‚Äî look closely at the last digit where the ‚Äú8‚Äù shows a slight impression of a ‚Äú7‚Äù going through it.

Experts theorize somebody forgot to change the date on the machines at the beginning of the year (like we all did back when it was still common to write personal checks by hand!).

It‚Äôs estimated that about 100,000 of the 1918-D double die coins were put out into circulation. Uncirculated versions of the coin are exceedingly rare because collectors didn‚Äôt get to them before the general public did.

A low-grade specimen of this coin has a value of nearly $1,000, while a genuine uncirculated version can top $50,000 in value.

1921-S, 1924-S, and 1926-S

The buffalo nickel was in wide circulation in the 1920s. But throughout the decade, there was a great disparity in the number of coins made by regional centers of the U.S. Mint ‚Äî specifically, San Francisco.

Philadelphia and San Francisco were the only U.S. Mints to produce the buffalo nickel in 1921. Philadelphia made over 10,000,000 nickels, while San Francisco only made around 1,500,000.

The low mintage of the San Francisco coins makes them far more valuable to collectors. While circulated 1921-S coins aren‚Äôt that hard to find, they still command high prices. The ultra-rare uncirculated coins can be worth more than $1,000 each.

Limited Supply

Similarly, the San Francisco U.S. Mint produced a paltry 1,500,000 buffalo nickels in 1924, only about one-fourteenth of the total made in Philadelphia and Denver.

1924-S buffalo nickels are extremely valuable to collectors, with uncirculated grades fetching more than $2,000 on the collectibles market.

San Francisco production of the 1926 buffalo nickel slowed down even more, capping at only 970,000. Philadelphia alone produced over 45,000,000 coins and Denver‚Äôs minting of almost 6,000,000. Again, 1926-S versions of the buffalo nickel are highly sought after.

1935 Doubled Die Reverse

All sorts of things went wrong at the Philadelphia U.S. Mint in 1935. Some buffalo nickels fell victim to the double die error, and those coins show what looks like an extra stamp on the ‚ÄúFIVE CENTS‚Äù and ‚ÄúE PLURIBUS UNUM‚Äù inscriptions. Another subset of those coins shows the doubling effect on features of the buffalo‚Äôs head.

1937-D Three-Legged Buffalo

This rare coin is, arguably, the most famous and definitive in the buffalo nickel series. In 1937, a Denver mint worker tried to repair some common scratches on a worn-out reverse die. In the process, they wound up over-polishing the die component.

This admirably eager but ultimately inattentive worker scrubbed so hard that they wound up removing the front foreleg of the buffalo, giving it the impression of having only three legs.

The mutant buffalo is worth a lot of money on the collectibles market. It was quickly removed from circulation in 1938, confirming its collectible status.

Watch out for fake versions of the three-legged buffalo coin. Some unscrupulous individuals with time on their hands have tried to ‚Äúrub out‚Äù the front leg on normal 1937 buffalo nickels to make it look like the rare version. These altered coins aren‚Äôt worth much at all.

What to Look for in Rare Buffalo Nickels

There are four distinguishing characteristics to consider when estimating the value of rare buffalo nickels. We‚Äôll describe these traits and identify those worth the most on the collectibles market.

The buffalo nickel was produced at three United States mint facilities: Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco. All versions of the buffalo nickel feature a date stamp showing the year the coin was minted (unless it has worn off over time). It‚Äôs found in the lower left area, just underneath the Native American chief‚Äôs head.

There are some buffalo nickels with no date stamped on them ‚Äî or at least appear so. This isn‚Äôt a design flaw; it‚Äôs simply because the date wore off over time. It may be possible to reveal the date with a commercial ferric chloride solution, but doing so can cause damage to the coin, making them almost worthless to collectors.

To properly value a rare buffalo nickel, you must know the date. The value of a buffalo nickel with no date is worth about ten cents. Luckily, in 1913, James Earl Fraser corrected his design of the buffalo nickel by dropping the lettering below the coin‚Äôs rim so the lettering and date wouldn‚Äôt wear off.

This minor adjustment to the raised coin stamping prevented premature wear and solved the problem of the buffalo nickel with no date marks. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your worn buffalo nickel is not the treasure you‚Äôve been searching for.

Mintmark

A single-letter mintmark indicates the buffalo nickel location was minted beneath the ‚ÄúFIVE CENTS‚Äù denomination ‚Äî or, as the case may be, the lack of one. Coins from Denver mints are identified with a ‚ÄúD‚Äù; San Francisco coins with an ‚ÄúS.‚Äù However, buffalo nickels with no mintmark came from the Philadelphia facility.

Although all buffalo nickels in mint state are worth considerably more than their face value, certain denominations fetch more than others. The series with the highest listed price is the 1926-S mint, owing to the low mintage San Francisco issue during the 1920s.

A mint-state 1926-S coin is worth nearly $3,000, and even one in merely good condition is worth about $15 ‚Äî considerably more than other buffalo nickels with no flaws.

Grading Condition

As with all other collectible coins, the condition of buffalo coins indicates the nickels that are worth money on the market. As you might expect, the more clearly and sharply the design elements appear on the coin, the higher grade it‚Äôs likely to score.

Rare Buffalo nickels are examined by a professional coin grading service with four quality categories: ‚Äúmint,‚Äù ‚Äúextremely fine,‚Äù ‚Äúfine,‚Äù and ‚Äúgood.‚Äù Mint coins have the clearest definition and are worth the most.

Hunting for more rare coins? You just might have a gold mine right under your nose ‚Äì

Most Valuable Wheat Pennies

Even merely ‚Äúgood‚Äù coins with obvious erosion and ‚Äúsmudged‚Äù looks may have a high price, depending on the other factors that infer value. Completely or near-completely faded buffalo nickels aren‚Äôt worth your time or money.

Buffalo nickels that were uncirculated are more valuable ‚Äî especially those produced in years when many buffalo nickels were in circulation, making those years‚Äô uncirculated versions extremely rare. An uncirculated 1936 buffalo nickel‚Äôs value is especially high at auction houses for just that reason.

Rare Buffalo Nickels Distinct Qualities and Errors

The 1913 design change is one example of an alteration that makes the buffalo nickel unique. Buffalo nickels from 1913 are divided into Type I and Type II, the difference being the appearance of either a raised ‚ÄúFIVE CENTS‚Äù denomination (Type I) or a recessed one (Type II).

And, of course, minting errors make collectors‚Äô hearts throb. Mint and extremely fine buffalo nickels in the 1918/17-D series are so rare; some appraisers don‚Äôt even list a value for them. Even merely ‚Äúfine‚Äù condition copies of this coin are worth more than $1,000.

But especially with the three-legged buffalo series, be on guard against counterfeit error coins with illegitimately inflated prices.

After accounting for work, sleep, cleaning and other must-dos, the typical American has about 5 hours of free time daily, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Five hours of free time on 7 days each week leaves us with 35 hours total (give or take, depending on what else might toss your schedule for a loop) to invest in whatever we see fit.

As pandemic-related shifts wear on, more and more of those hours are getting eaten up with extra screen time. This may be due to work from home duties, extra Netflix binges, tallying up more TikTok time or your Wordle obsession. But despite all those ""free"" hours for leisure, less than one in four Americans gets enough aerobic and strength training exercise, the CDC says.

With this in mind, and well aware that 150 minutes of exercise per week can sound daunting to those starting at zero, researchers from the CDC and the National Cancer Institute set out to determine exactly how much‚Äîactually, how little‚Äîexercise might make us healthier. Among adults age 40 to 85, just 10 additional minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day would save 110,000 lives per year, according to a January 2022 report in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. At 20 extra minutes per day, this stat nearly doubles (209,459 lives) and at 30 extra minutes, the researchers believe could prevent 272,297 deaths per year.

""We have known that regular exercise is essential and has tremendous health benefits,"" Vanita Rahman, M.D., the clinic director of the Barnard Medical Center at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine tells Healthline. ""What is unique about the study is that it shows us just how beneficial exercise is by providing quantitative measures. Regular exercise benefits virtually every organ system in our body. It reduces blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Exercise can also help us sleep better and improve our mood, sense of well-being and quality of life.""

Story continues

And you don't need to train for a 5K or take a Peloton class daily to score some very serious health benefits. Yes, even though many fitness pros claim that 30 minutes should be the bare minimum.

""People become so focused on needing 30 minutes of movement each day that if they can't dedicate a full 30 for any reason (as opposed to breaking it up throughout the day into 10-minute increments, for example), they'll end up doing nothing. This study linking movement and longevity is a good reminder that some type of exercise or functional movement throughout your day is still always better than doing nothing,"" Dana Ryan, Ph.D., director of sport performance and education at Herbalife Nutrition, adds to Healthline.

Think of it similar to your diet or hydration. Just because you don't eat your five-a-day every day (as in fruits and veggies) or drink 91 ounces of water, it doesn't mean you should just throw in the towel and eat zero fruits and vegetables and drink only soda or juice. Every little bit gets you closer to the ""ideal,"" and each step makes it easier to make‚Äîand build upon‚Äîthe habit. True, 10 minutes in one day doesn't seem like a lot. But add that up over the course of a year and you'll move your body nearly 61 more hours than if you used those 10 minutes to scroll through Instagram while sitting on the couch. (Hey, we've certainly been there, done that. Everything in moderation!)

Little shifts like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, parking farther from the entrance at the supermarket or trying this quick, equipment-free home strength workout can all be great ways to add one or more extra 10-minute nuggets of movement to your day. In addition to lowering risk for death, as we mentioned, regular exercise protects the body from aging-related bone and muscle loss.

""In our 30s, we all begin experiencing some level of age-related muscle loss called sarcopenia. If we are active daily, we lose less, but if we are inactive, we can lose on average 3 to 5 percent of our muscle mass per decade,"" Danine Fruge, M.D., medical director of the Pritikin Longevity Center in Miami, tells Healthline. ""Maintaining a healthy muscle mass for our age is key for preventing falls and unhealthy bodies as well as increasing both qualities of life and longevity.""

No matter how hard or how long you go, this research proves that movement matters. Here's how to exercise when you have literally no time, then discover the 5 best exercises for your health, according to a Harvard doctor.‚Äã‚Äã

And when you're ready to up the ante, crank up the intensity with a vigorous 10-minute micro workout. Doing so can rev your metabolism and help you burn more energy at rest."

As was forecast back in December, the burger slinger is cutting several menu items in order to streamline and speed up its service at the drive-thru. But the chain will also be making a change concerning its most famous sandwich.

According to Tuesday's fourth-quarter earnings call, the Whopper is being removed from the Two for $5 promotion. The revamped value menu currently includes the Big King Sandwich, the Single Quarter Pound King Sandwich, the Fish Sandwich, and the Original Chicken Sandwich.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

In December, Burger King announced it will be making some cuts to its menu in order to simplify operations and speed up service at its drive-thrus. Customers will be saying goodbye to some of the less popular items like sundaes, whipped toppings, and chocolate milk, according to Reuters.

The burger brand was up by 11.3% in same-store sales during the final quarter of 2021, with the same metric up by 1.8% in the U.S., showing that its biggest performance struggles are still taking place in the home market.

These menu changes come as the latest in line of several cost-cutting measures Burger King has been implementing since last year. In October, executives said the chain will begin phasing out paper coupons, which have served to get customers in the door for decades. Jose Cil, the CEO of Burger King's parent company, said the goal was to reduce the volume of promotions overall.

""For years, we've been spreading ourselves too thin across too many messages with mixed results . . . we've consistently had the most value constructs in the market, three times as many as our lead competitors, which diluted marketing firepower and added to operational complexity,"" Cil said. ""It also confused guests.""

Burger King's entire menu is expected to get more expensive this year, as the chain combats inflation. However, the company declined to provide specifics on when exactly the price increases are expected to be applied."

https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/apple-just-quietly-introduced-a-feature-to-your-iphone-that-is-going-to-upend-this-17-trillion-industry.html,"Earlier this week, Apple put out a press release announcing it was adding a feature to your iPhone. Soon, you'll be able to use it as a credit-card reader. Well, sort of. Apple is adding the ability for third-party payment services to use the built-in NFC chip to accept contactless payments. As the press release says:

The new capability will empower millions of merchants across the U.S., from small businesses to large retailers, to use their iPhone to seamlessly and securely accept Apple Pay, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets through a simple tap to their iPhone -- no additional hardware or payment terminal needed. Tap to Pay on iPhone will be available for payment platforms and app developers to integrate into their iOS apps and offer as a payment option to their business customers.

The move had been previously reported by Bloomberglast month.

At this point, Apple hasn't said whether it plans to offer its own service to take advantage of the tap-to-pay feature. Instead, it plans to offer the ability for third-party payment providers to integrate with the feature. In its announcement, Apple said that digital payment processor Stripe would be the first service to take advantage of the new capability.

That's a big deal, as Stripe has become the default online payment processor for millions of small businesses. CB Insights, a research analysis firm, estimates Stripe processed more than $350 billion in payments in 2020. Its customers range from small online shops, to software developers, to large corporations like Slack and Peloton.

While Stripe is currently one of the biggest players in online transactions, contactless payments are a roughly $1.7 trillion market, according to analysts. The thing is, for small businesses, the choice is often between signing a contract with a traditional merchant-services provider and paying for expensive point-of-sale terminals, signing up for a service like Square, or using a peer-to-peer service like Venmo or CashApp.

Square, which first made point-of-sale credit card transactions simple for small businesses with its eponymous card reader that you could insert into the headphone jack of your iPhone, dominates this market. Visit any farmer's market or boutique retail shop, and there's a good chance that you'll see someone using an iPad or iPhone along with a small piece of hardware bearing the Square logo.

The problem is, you're still bringing along another piece of hardware that has to be connected via Bluetooth. What if you have multiple people working? That means adding additional pieces of hardware, often at a cost that can add up. That additional cost and complexity can be a big deal for a small business.

It's at this small end of the scale that Apple's new feature is most likely to make a difference. Being able to accept credit-card payments directly on an iPhone means that you don't have to worry about pairing devices via Bluetooth or making sure your card reader is charged. You just open an app on the device you already have with you.

One of the other benefits is the ability to use a single provider for both online and in-person sales. For example, since Stripe offers both, a small business can have a single payment service. I imagine it won't be long before other payment processing services follow -- including Square.

I mention it because a lot of the coverage of Apple's announcement suggests this could be the end of Square. For example, this Gizmodo article says just that:

Basically, this cuts out companies like Square, which offer hardware that connects to an iPhone so small businesses (food truckers, farmers market stands) can accept payments from debit cards, credit cards, smartphones, and other devices that support contactless payments.

That doesn't really make sense. While it's true that a business wouldn't need additional hardware to accept payments, I don't think Apple is trying to kill Square. After all, there's nothing sacred about the Square card reader.

Square basically gives away the readers to customers who use its payment processing service. That's where Square makes its money, and there's no reason the company couldn't decide to make its software compatible with Apple's new feature. For that matter, it should."

https://technologicalassistant.blogspot.com/2022/02/how-record-inflation-in-us-will-affect.html,"Price growth in the US in annual terms was a record for 40 years. Understanding what to expect from the market and what stocks you should pay attention to during a period of rising inflation and rates





Annual inflation in the US in January continued to accelerate and reached 7.5%. The last time at such a high level was recorded in 1982. Inflation growth exceeded analysts' forecasts, which had expected 7%.

American stock indices at the opening of the main trading session fell by 1-2%, but later won back most of the fall: at 20:33 Moscow time, Dow Jones is down 0.09% (35734 points), Nasdaq - by 0.26% (14445 points ), S&P 500 - by 0.36% (4570 points).

The surge in inflation is associated with the loose monetary policy of central banks in the context of the coronacrisis. To support markets and business, regulators around the world, including in the US, lowered the base interest rate, which became the basis for inflationary acceleration.

The rise in prices is also under pressure from a significant increase in the wages of employees. U.S. wages rose 4.5% year-over-year, the fastest pace since 2002, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

At the same time, the coronavirus and lockdowns have caused problems in supply chains, with many companies temporarily halting production. This increased the costs of producers, and the increase in wholesale prices overtook consumer prices.

According to a Bloomberg survey, many economists expect inflation to be already nearing its peak, falling to 4.8% within a year and then to 2.4% by the end of 2023. In the bond market, long-term inflation expectations are in the region of the Fed's target of 2%.

Against the backdrop of a sharp rise in prices, the decision to raise the base rate of the Fed at the next meeting on March 15-16 is no longer in doubt. Traders are putting in a 50% chance of a 0.5 p.p. in March, according to Bloomberg. If the Fed raises rates by half a percentage point at once, it will be the sharpest rate hike since 2000. The market is also pricing in a 77% chance of six rate hikes in 2022.





What to expect from the markets after the release of inflation data





‚ÄúThe market will largely depend not only on the decision on the interest rate, but also on the decision on the Fed's balance sheet. This is also a very important story, perhaps even more important, because in the past, quantitative easing provided additional liquidity and contributed to faster growth in stocks. I do not rule out that there may be surprises - I proceed from the fact that in the spring the Fed will decide that at least the volumes of mortgage and treasury bonds on the balance sheet will not be refinanced, ‚ÄùEgor Susin, head of the strategy development center at Gazprombank, told RBC Investments.





According to him, the process of reducing the Fed's balance sheet will actually lead to the fact that risk assessment, which was previously heavily understated against the backdrop of excess liquidity from the stimulus program, will increase.





‚ÄúMost likely we will see a continuation of the correction that began this year. I proceed from the fact that throughout the first half of the year we can see negative dynamics in the markets,‚Äù Susin summed up.

Vladimir Bragin, Director for Financial Market Analysis and Macroeconomics at Alfa Capital Management Company, in a conversation with RBC Investments, noted two factors that will have a significant impact on the markets. On the one hand, investors have to put in a higher discount rate (the amount used to calculate future cash flows), and there are also fears that higher rates will lead to a slowdown in the economy - for companies, this means lower corporate profit expectations. On the other hand, inflation leads not only to an increase in consumer prices, but also to an increase in the general price level in the economy. Due to higher inflation, projected growth in profits and revenues should also rise.

‚ÄúIn my opinion, investors will shirk from one extreme to another. Either they will be afraid of raising rates, as they are now, then they will rejoice with the release of financial statements. This shyness will lead to strong fluctuations in the market during the year, as I see it for myself now. Not that the markets will fall and will decline for a long time and stubbornly, no, rather it will be a one-way movement depending on the rate increase or the released data on financial results, ‚Äùhe concluded.

‚ÄúWe saw that the rates on 10-year US government bonds at the moment reached 2% per annum. This directly affects growth stocks and will lead to increased competition for capital - money will be more expensive, and it will be much more difficult for loss-making companies. I think we can see the Russell 100 index continue to move down, and finance and the oil and gas sector will most likely become the beneficiaries in the first half of the year,‚Äù Vyacheslav Golik, portfolio manager at ALG Capital, said on RBC TV.

According to him, you need to look at companies that have a strong cash flow. Companies with a large debt load and those whose discounted cash flow model (DCF) valuation will be hit hard by the Fed rate hike are likely to be underdogs.

‚ÄúCompanies like Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Bank of America, JPMorgan, Exxon Mobil are old companies that will be the beneficiaries of both rising interest rates and inflation. Of course, you should pay attention to them if it suits someone's portfolio. This is a good choice, ‚Äùthe expert summed up.

Want's to know Some Mysterious Facts About Roman Reigns that You Don't Know. Then you are at the right article because here you will get to know Some amazing Facts about Roman Reigns.





Roman Reigns has come a legend in the WWE Universe. He won the 2018 Universal Championship by defeating Brock Lesnar. Reigns is also a polarizing figure, and cult dislike him. Utmost people call him a silent badass.

He has been relatively uncommunicative about his particular life, and connections.





So Let's Start our Today's Topic 10 Mysterious Facts About Roman Reigns that You Don't Know. So Read the Full Article.





















Here are the 10 Mysterious Facts About Roman Reigns that You Don't Know.









1). CM Punk Did Not Want Reigns a Part of the ""Hounds of Justice"".





Punk not only wanted The Shield to support him-- they kind of did-- but he noway wanted Roman Reigns as the group's leader. Rather, he suggested the group be comprised of Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Chris Hero. Triadic H dismissed Hero and suggested Reigns rather. Punk's response""It wasn't his hill to die on.""

2). Roman has Never Won a Championship.

No. We are not just talking about in the WWE. Reigns has noway won a mates title ever. And ever, as in, not in the experimental leagues and presumably not indeed when he was rehearsing wrestling moves in his vicinity on a trampoline.





Another issue suckers have with Reigns is he has spent further time on the microphone and in label matches than trying to win mates crowns. And that is going back to his days in the experimental league. It's frequently tough for devoted wrestling suckers to watch Reigns get the drive when indeed Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins-- his former Shield counterparts-- have both held a single's belt high multiple times.









3). The Former Leader of The Shield Didn't Wrestle Much in 2014.

Suckers still want Dolph Ziggler to be a main event megastar. They wanted the company to give Cesaro his proper drive. And they still long for the day Daniel Bryan officially etches his name into the WWE history books as one of the most hallowed titleholders ever. And right now, they'd take all of these stars over Roman Reigns whose drive, they feel, is unjustified.





Quite simply, Reigns hasn't developed enough of a capsule to allow people to judge whether he is the right joe to lead the WWE. The following table shows how little Reigns has done compared to the three other wrestlers numerous suckers still pull for.

4). Not John Cena Roman Itself Makes it Clear.

Roman Reigns has made it clear that he is NOT John Cena, but it's hard to believe that if you watch how addict's reply when he enters the ring. Over the times, Cena has managed to chump pierce himself as the company's biggest baby face character despite harmonious razzes from a crowd that wants nothing to do it.





Reigns recognizes that he is being compared to Cena and also wants nothing to do with that. In an interview with Reno Gazette Journal, Reigns pushed back when being asked about his comparisons to Cena.""As a company, we do not let people mandate to us what is supposed to be. Last time I checked, my hair is long and spurt black and last time I checked John Cena's isn't. So for anybody to compare me to him is fully asinine.""

















5). Reigns Would Transform into Iron Man Over Batman.





Roman Reigns would prefer to be Forceful Man over Batman because""Iron Man knows how to have fun.""If he'd given that answer while a part of The Shield-- a group that dressed in all black and notoriously beat down opponents, the comment would have appeared out of place.

Still, given Reigns' current baby- face character, the answer seems befitting. Reigns kicks burro in the ring and also seems to appreciate the people he beats. I suppose Iron Man does have a little further fun taking down his opponents than the always serious Batman.





















6). Reigns Has an Eye for the Bright Lights of Hollywood.





Still, than the expression""the apple does not fall from the tree"" impeccably describes how important Reigns' family thinks likewise, If we are going to use a clich√©. Reigns is open to the idea of gaping in Hollywood and does not believe the limelight will be too hot for him.

""If that occasion comesup.I am willing to try anything and gain a little experience in anything,""Reigns said to Chuck Carroll on Turnbuckle Weekly. Still, what made his kinsman The Rock so successful in Hollywood was both the former's charm and success as a wrestler. Reigns has a long way to go before he holds a Championship belt as high as The Rock. In fact, he needs to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship first.

7). One of Reigns' Matches Earned a 4.5 Star Rating.





There are numerous reasons suckers tend to love to detest Roman Reigns. One reason is because they feel he has a limited compendium of moves. Reigns is solely a high- impact megastar, which means he frequently has trouble filling in the gaps in between his high- impact moves similar as the Superman Punch and Spear.





Still, that did not stop famed wrestling expert and author of The Wrestling Observer, Dave Meltzer, from awarding Reigns and his Shield counterparts a4.5 standing during their debut match at TLC 2012. Indeed The Rock and Undertaker noway held that honor. The Rock failed to earn indeed a four standing during his on RAW in 1996 and Undertaker graded indeed lower. Meltzer awarded him a3.5 standing. Now we get that Reigns was part of a label- platoon, but a debut is a debut, right?





















8). Reigns is the Youngest WWE Star to Win ""The Superstar of the Year"" Slammy.





The Slammy Awards is the WWE's original to the Academy or Grammy Awards. The only difference is that while the Academy Awards and Grammy's admit past performances, the Slammys are substantially used to set up unborn stardom.

The Slammys aren't a new conception, although, they've taking a number of hiatuses since their induction in 1986. Reigns acceptance of the award in December 2014 marked a significant point in his rise as an individual megastar. At 28 times old, he was the youthful megastar to win the award.













9). Reigns May Act Tough, but He's a Softy Inside.





Reigns destroys opponents in the ring. He pikestaffs them back to the experimental leagues. But outside the ring, Reigns is much different. He is a family man who married his council squeeze Galina Becker in December 2014 and has a youthful son named Joelle.

It's no surprise he is kept his connubial status and immediate family a secret. It's tough to play a bully when everyone knows you are just a big wuss back stage.

















10). Before The Shield, Reigns Was Part of Even Stronger Alliances.

Reigns began to develop and edge his now assessing persona well before he stepped into the squared circle. It was during these early days he probably also developed a sense for how important it's to have strong abettors.

Playing Council guard attack for Chan Gailey's Unheroic Jackets, Reigns stood side by side with unborn Hall-of- Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson. When Reigns left council, the Minnesota Vikings inked him as an undrafted free agent. While brief, who was his teammate in Minnesota? Adrian Peterson. No wonder why Reigns holds similar high prospects for both himself and those who compass him.

https://www.otgnewz.com/2022/02/discovery-of-unique-rock-that-causes.html,"TOKYO: A fiery rock has been discovered off the coast of southern Japan that could act as a magnet or an electric rod and cause strong earthquakes.

Volcanic rocks are commonly called Agnes Rock. This rock is called ""Kumano platoon"".A detailed 3D map shows that the energy of the tectonic plates reaches the sides of the rock and is slowly accumulating.

This important research will help in predicting possible earthquakes in Japan and will also help to know the connection between volcanic rock and tectonic plates.

""It's hard to say where and when major earthquakes will occur in the future, but data and modeling can accurately predict them,"" said Sushi Kodera, a senior scientist at the Maritime Earth Science and Technology Agency. Are

In 2006, scientists discovered the Kumano Pluton, a rock composed of molten terrestrial matter. Pluto is a rock that erupts out of the earth's crust by removing other rocks and gradually cools and hardens.

In addition, it is learned that in the Nankai subduction zone, one geological plate is sinking into another plate which is called subduction process. This causes energy to accumulate on the plates and cause earthquakes. Then it was discovered that there was a Pluto rock at one place.

Experts then collected data for another 20 years and mapped the blueton rock, confirming it.

We know that whether an earthquake is small or large, its effects spread like wildfire from place to place in a pond, wreaking havoc and returning. Experts have mapped out the process, which is a daunting task. Terrible earthquakes of 1944 and 1946 also erupted from this place and now it is known that the role of Pluto was very important."

You may formerly know that Valentine's Day was named after its patron saint,St. Valentine ‚Äî but there is actually some confusion girding whichSt. Valentine the vacation technically honors. According toHistory.com, there are at least two men named Valentine that could've inspired the vacation, including one Valentine who was a clerk in third century Rome. As the story goes, this Valentine defied Emperor Claudius II's ban on marriage (he allowed it detracted youthful dogfaces), immorally marrying couples in the spirit of love until he was caught and doomed to death."

This is the latest pandemic phenomenon called Wordle ‚Äî a free online game that gives users a new word puzzle each day. It was created by Josh Wardle for his crossword-loving partner. As of January 10, the game has 2.7 million players.

In Wordle, players have six tries to guess a target five-letter word. Every time they make a guess, they are told which letters in their guess are in the word and in the correct position (green), and which letters are in it but in a different position (yellow). It‚Äôs sort of like the board game Mastermind but with a key difference. In Mastermind, all six colors were equally likely to appear in the target. In Wordle, because guesses and targets all have to be real words, some letters are more likely to appear, making some guesses better than others.

This leads to a question that I‚Äôve seen people discussing at length online: what is the best first word to guess?

How to find the best first guess

For now, let‚Äôs define the ‚Äúbest first guess‚Äù as the one that is most likely to share the most letters with the target word. What we need to know is: how common are each of the 26 letters in five-letter English words. And not just in any five-letter words, those that have a chance of showing up as targets.

Obscure words like ‚Äúnisus‚Äù (a mental or physical effort to attain an end) or ‚Äúwinze‚Äù (a connection between different levels of a mine) need not apply.

I found a recent study that looked at over 60,000 English words and how well-known they were. This sort of statistic is interesting for language researchers like me because it captures something about how easily a word can be processed: on average, more commonly known words are read faster.

I took all five-letter words that were known by at least 50 percent of those studied (if you knew ‚Äúnisus‚Äù or ‚Äúwinze‚Äù ‚Äî I certainly didn‚Äôt ‚Äî you share that feat with only 7 percent of the sample). Then I counted the number of times each letter appeared at least once in a word.

Letter frequencies in Wordle

The most common letter was ‚Äúe‚Äù, appearing in 46 percent of words. This is a well-known pattern that applies to the English language in general. A notable exception is George Perec‚Äôs novel A Void, which was purposefully written without the letter ‚Äúe‚Äù. This pattern was even used by Sherlock Holmes in The Adventure of the Dancing Men to decode a cipher made up of dancing stick figures by reasoning that the most common symbol would be ‚Äúe‚Äù.

The mysterious sequence of dancing stick figures that Holmes deciphers in The Adventure of the Dancing Men. Author provided

One reason that ‚Äúe‚Äù is so common was the advent of silent e‚Äôs at the end of words in the 16th century, used to signal something about the preceding sounds. For example, ‚Äútone‚Äù is pronounced differently than ‚Äúton‚Äù.

The next most common letters were: ‚Äúa‚Äù (39 percent), ‚Äúr‚Äù (34 percent), ‚Äúo‚Äù (29 percent), and ‚Äúi‚Äù and ‚Äús‚Äù tied for fifth (28 percent). Out of these six letters, one word immediately ‚Äúarose‚Äù as the best option! Want an especially bad first guess? Try ‚Äúwhump‚Äù (a dull thudding sound). That is just about the worst by this metric.

But while ‚Äúarose‚Äù is most likely to get you letters in the target, they may not be in the correct positions.

The most frequent letters, by position, in common five-letter words.

If we want a word that is most likely to get letters in their correct positions, the best option is ‚Äúsamey‚Äù (monotonous, repetitive, unvaried). But let‚Äôs not stop there. If we put these approaches together into one final score, we get a word that looks eyrie-ly familiar: ‚Äúsoare‚Äù (a young hawk) ‚Äî ‚Äúarose‚Äù but in a more strategic order.

One final thing to note. While writing this article I found that people had gotten into the source code for the Wordle website and found the actual list of words that can appear as targets. I decided not to use that list because I found it more fun to try and answer the question with available language resources. Also, that list might change and I wanted to find a more general answer.

But, just to put your mind at ease, when I do all of the above with that list of ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Wordle targets, ‚Äúsoare‚Äù ends up being the best once again. So there you have it. Now what you do with guesses two through six is up to you.

https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/sofi-stadium-super-bowl-cec/index.html,"(CNN) ‚Äî From Joe Burrow and Matthew Stafford to Eminem and Mary J. Blige, Sunday's Super Bowl in Los Angeles will feature plenty of famous faces.

But the event's biggest star might be the stadium itself.

The NFL's newest glittering shrine, SoFi Stadium has lured the Super Bowl back to greater Los Angeles for the first time in almost 30 years. And like the breathlessly hyped Super Bowl itself, it's full of superlatives.

At 3.1 million square feet, it's the largest and the first ""indoor-outdoor"" stadium in the NFL. It's got an adjacent six-acre lake, an enormous video board hovering over the field like a giant halo and a striking, curved canopy that flashes messages and videos to airplanes overhead.

""There's always a tremendous sense of excitement and awe"" when visitors see the stadium for the first time, says Jason Gannon, SoFi Stadium's managing director. ""The building itself -- the structure of the building -- architecturally is incredible. The curvature of the roof, the size of it, is incredibly unique and interesting. People will find it to be quite an experience.""

The San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams played in the NFC Championship Game at SoFi Stadium on January 30. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images

Built in Inglewood on the site of the former Hollywood Park Racetrack, the $5 billion stadium opened in 2020 as home to both the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers. It can seat up to 100,000 people. The Rams are playing in the Super Bowl, on their home field, against the Cincinnati Bengals.

SoFi has quickly become a preferred showcase for large-scale events.

Justin Bieber, BTS and the Rolling Stones have performed there. It's also is slated to host next year's College Football National Championship and the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2028 Summer Olympics.

If you're planning a trip to Los Angeles , it may be worth a visit. Here are six of the stadium's unique features.

1. Three-quarters of it lies underground

Morry Gash/AP

The stadium sits just three miles east of Los Angeles International Airport -- and in LAX's flight path. FAA restrictions prohibited architects from building a towering structure.

So the football field itself lies 100 feet below ground level -- double the depth of any other NFL venue. To accomplish this, more than 7 million cubic yards of dirt were excavated from the stadium bowl.

With most stadiums, fans arrive at ground level and then climb to their seats. At SoFi, they mostly descend. Designers studied cliffside architecture and built terraced pathways, surrounded by landscaped gardens, that lead fans down toward the field.

""We wanted the experience of going down into the stadium to be something truly unique,"" says Lance Evans, the stadium's lead architect . ""So we used the natural landscape and terracing to welcome the fans as they come down the building.""

2. The roof has an LED screen that can air live TV to passing airplanes

Kirby Lee/USA Today Sports

The vast roof is made up of hundreds of semi-translucent panels that diffuse sunlight during the day to reduce glare and help cool the building.

At night, the canopy becomes a giant, illuminated screen, thanks to a network of LED lights that can project images and video.

The roof can even air live TV. In November 2020, the Rams showed their Monday Night Football game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on the stadium's canopy, offering an aerial show to airplane passengers on their final approach to nearby LAX.

3. It's open on the sides to take advantage of SoCal breezes

While the canopy covers the entire football field and the stands, the stadium is open to the elements on its sides beyond the two end zones. The roof also has 46 panels that can be opened to boost airflow.

The aerodynamic design takes advantage of SoCal's temperate climate and earns the facility its ""indoor-outdoor"" label.

""We carved this building to allow the ocean breezes to pass through it and promote airflow,"" says Evans, the architect. ""But also to give the visitors here connectivity to the beautiful surroundings here in Southern California. So you're looking into Malibu on this side, you can see the Hollywood Hills on the east side, Palos Verdes down to the south.""

The open-air design also means that parts of the stadium, despite being sheltered under a massive roof, are susceptible to wind, rain and lightning strikes. That's why a game last October between the Chargers and the Las Vegas Raiders was delayed while a thunderstorm passed overhead.

4. Its hanging video screen is larger than the football field

Ronald Martinez/Getty Images

Suspended over the field like a spaceship is an enormous video screen in the shape of a ring.

Its official name is the Infinity Screen by Samsung, and it's the largest such screen in sports -- 70,000 square feet of digital LED, with about 80 million pixels. It's longer and wider than the football field itself.

It's also the only dual-sided screen, meaning that messages and video are shown on its inner and outer surfaces. This is especially helpful to fans seated down near the field, who can gaze up at the inner screen on the opposite side of the ring.

""It can immerse fans in content,"" Evans says. That's presumably when fans are not watching, you know, the game itself.

5. It has field-level suites just beyond the end zone

Harry How/Getty Images

If you're feeling flush and want to impress several dozen of your buddies, you can reserve a field-level suite, called a bungalow, that's only a few yards from the back of the end zone. The suites are so close to the action that an overthrown pass could land in your plate of nachos.

""They're the closest field seats in the NFL. It'll feel like you're in your backyard,"" says Evans. ""Put your feet up on the green rail, be as casual as can be. It just so happens that the energy of an NFL game is happening 10 feet on the other side of the rail.""

6. Tours let you run a 40-yard dash and kick a field goal

From SoFi Stadium

You can book a stadium tour that will take you to the private luxury suites, the teams' locker rooms and an interview room where coaches and players field questions from reporters. As of December 2021, visitors are required to provide proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test result.

But the most memorable part of the tour may be visiting the field itself -- accessed via a 60-foot tunnel to replicate the players' experience of charging onto the turf before a game.

""The tour affords you an opportunity to go down on the field of play ... and actually engage in combine-like activities -- to run the 40-yard dash, to throw a football, to kick a field goal and measure how you perform (when compared) to NFL athletes,"" Gannon says. ""I think that's really the fun and engaging part of the tour."""

https://www.iflscience.com/technology/china-wants-to-build-an-8000mile-underwater-train-line-to-the-usa/,"China currently has one of the most expansive and impressive high-speed rail networks on Earth, and they aren‚Äôt showing signs of slowing. As their network reaches the far corners of their nation, Beijing could be setting its eyes on what lies beyond ‚Äì far, far beyond.

According to reports, China wishes to build a high-speed, 13,000-kilometer (8,078-mile) train that travels from mainland China, up through Siberia in Eastern Russia, under the sea through the Bering Strait into Alaska, across the rocky peaks of Canada‚Äôs Yukon and British Columbia, and into the USA. Once constructed, they have could further extend their international bullet train into every corner of the US.

The price of such an outlandish proposal? A cool $200 billion. A price tag so high, even the likes of Jeff Bezos probably couldn‚Äôt reach it.

The plans emerged in 2014, when multiple news outlets covered a report by the Beijing Times that outlined plans for China to build the 8,000-mile super train. It would be called the ‚ÄúChina-Russia-Canada-America"" line (catchy, we know) and stretch across all four nations, connecting them together for a trade, tourism, and economic boom. Stretching across the Bering Strait, it would require an underwater tunnel four times larger than the Channel Tunnel, and far more high-tech to boot.

At the time, engineers from China claimed to be already in talks with Russia about beginning the line, which they were very confident was possible with current technology.

And despite just how far-fetched the proposal sounds, it could be perfectly feasible.

In 2018, China approved the world‚Äôs first underwater bullet train, which would extend nationally from Ningbo, a port city near Shanghai, to Zhoushan, an archipelago of islands off the East coast. Covering a 77-kilometer (47.8-mile) stretch of almost entirely newly-built railway, the new route will include a 16.2-kilometer underwater section. It will be a Maglev train, levitating above a magnetic track as it is propelled along at high speeds, and construction is well underway for the ambitious project.

Although this tunnel is significantly smaller than the Channel Tunnel, the addition of a bullet train passing through brings new challenges to the construction. While little is known about progress on the China-Russia-Canada-America line, some have postulated that the Ningbo-Zhoushan line could be a test run of sorts for a far larger project.

As for the US? They might be a little further behind. In 2020, the US Government approved a huge 2,570-kilometer (1,597-mile) railway line that connects the US and Canada, from Alaska to Alberta. Costing $22 billion, the line was a large leap for the US railway network, which has been lagging behind other nations until now. With China‚Äôs rapidly expanding bullet train network, the famous Japanese network, and other nations surging forward with their attempts, the US is now on the back foot when it comes to railway innovation.

Unfortunately, as impressive as the China-Russia-Canada-America line would be, it appears to have been put on hold for now. Critics have slammed the proposal for being economically redundant, stating that flight and cargo ships are a cheaper option for trade, and too complex. Whether they are right or not, tensions between the world superpowers mean such a collaboration ‚Äì which would be the most expensive megaproject in world history ‚Äì could be little more than a pipe dream.

What Is the Difference Between Social Media and Digital Marketing?





Successful marketing is all about reaching out and communicating with customers. And where does your target audience spend their time these days? Now, more than ever, the answer is online.





For your online marketing strategies to be effective, it is important to understand the difference between digital marketing and social media marketing. With the right combination, your marketing strategy will definitely succeed.





Why Social Media and Digital Marketing Are Important?





By 2019, there were an estimated 4.39 billion internet users (source), an increase of 9% dramatically from 2018. In January 2019, there were 3.26 billion people using social media platforms on their mobile devices.





If you are looking to grow your business and increase conversions, it is time to use the unlimited power of internet marketing that I can offer.





Before we dive into the important differences between the field of communication and digital marketing, let us first examine what each one entails. Although often called alternatives, both present different opportunities and challenges that require different strategies.









What is Digital Marketing?





Digital marketing is an umbrella term for advertising products or services through online-based channels. It takes the opportunity of various digital channels to reach the audience with one common thing: the internet.





Common Digital Marketing Tools





Digital marketing covers the entire internet, making it extremely difficult. This scenario requires nuanced marketing strategies targeting different areas of the digital world. Some common digital marketing tools include:





.Pay-per-click advertising .Email marketing .Search engine optimization .Content marketing .Social media posts and advertisement .Influencer and affiliate program .Mobile advertising





Why Digital Marketing Is Important?

These days, many buying decisions start out (and at an ever-increasing rate) online. According to a 2014 survey by MineWhat, 81% of consumers do an online survey before buying (source).





Strong digital strategy is an integral part of any modern marketing plan. Effective digital marketing helps to improve products and services, creates long-term product awareness, and connects with customers as they go through marketing.









What is Social Media Marketing?





Social media marketing uses social media to build your brand, connect with targeted audiences, drive traffic to your website, and (most importantly) convert the hard-earned leads into sales.





This is achieved through paid advertising ‚Äî such as collaborating with promoters or posting native ads on your target audience feeds ‚Äî or by promoting your company's social media pages.





When building a business presence for your business, it is important that you create unique content and engage fully with your fans. It is equally important to analyze the effectiveness of your social media content ‚Äî both paid and live.









What are Metrics in Social Media Marketing?





When it comes to social media statistics, there are a number of metrics you will want to monitor closely:





.Involvement: a comprehensive rating of social shares, likes, and comments on your social media posts and account .Impressions: The number of times your content has been viewed, regardless of whether the user interacts with the post .Access: average audience size of a specific location .Referral: users who visit your site via social media posts, ads and links .Conversion: customers identified on social media end up shopping on your site





Social Media Platforms for Marketing





Your social media marketing strategy, including the platforms you use, should be different from your business and its marketing objectives. By 2020, the most popular social media platforms are Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Pinterest, and Snapchat.





Launching a successful marketing campaign in all of these platforms can be time-consuming and costly, so many companies focus their efforts on two or three top platforms used by their customers.





Each forum contains unique marketing opportunities and targets slightly different audiences, so it is important to do a little research or contact a marketing forum for social media.





Digital Marketing versus Social Media Marketing

Social media marketing falls under the huge umbrella of digital marketing. The main difference between social media and digital marketing is that the first can only happen on one channel: social media.





Digital marketing covers the entire internet and can include everything from creating a Yelp page to buying a PPC ad on a search engine.





Should I use social media or digital marketing?





Both types of marketing are effective in reaching potential customers, building brand awareness, and growing sales of products and services.





In our ever-increasing digital world, both social media marketing and digital marketing should be considered the cornerstones of your overall marketing strategy. Finding the right balance depends on the nature of your business and its objectives."

It's one of the cases that still sticks with him, and that reiterates the importance of holding parents to account, he says."

https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-is-coming-to-xbox-series-x-and-that-is-technically-correct/1100-6500850/,"Uncharted will soon be available on Xbox consoles, albeit not in the way that you're probably thinking about right now. No, Microsoft hasn't dipped into its money vault to buy developer Naughty Dog, but the Uncharted film will be arriving on Blu-ray disc soon, which means that the live-action adaptation of Sony's hit game series can be technically played on an Xbox console.

Remember, technically correct is still the best kind of correct. Full credit to Wario64 for the joke and ruining the day of at least one diehard PlayStation fan.

As for the film, it'll be available in 4K UHD quality, although special features have yet to be announced for it. If it lines up with other big-budget releases on Blu-ray disc, expect behind-the-scenes commentary, short documentaries on how the film was made, and a look at the origins of the Uncharted franchise.

For the Sony fans who are likely dismayed at this traitorous news, they can take solace in the fact that Halo can be played PlayStation soon, through the Paramount+ app when the live-action series arrives in March.

The Uncharted film is still showing at theaters, where it's expected to do some respectable business on its opening weekend in the US. Here at GameSpot, our Uncharted review scored the movie a 7/10. Reviewer Phil Hornshaw said, ""Uncharted is a lot of fun a lot of the time. It might not do much that the games haven't already, but fans will enjoy a new Uncharted tale that at least brings its own flashy, death-defying treasure hunt into the fold."""
