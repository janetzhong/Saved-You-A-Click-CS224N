1,They put sunblock on their eyes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/space/some-people-didnt-quite-understand-what-watch-safely-meant-during-the-eclipse/,"The Great American Eclipse was a wonderful, perhaps once-in-a-lifetime, opportunity to see the gorgeous cosmic ballet in action. It also seemed to provoke plenty of people up and down the country to do something rather stupid: look at the Sun during the eclipse without any protective glasses on at all.

Although the most famous person to ignore the advice of essentially every scientist and journalist on the planet was the President of the United States, spikes in Google searches for terms like “I looked at the Sun” and “eclipse headache” reveal that he wasn’t alone in this endeavor.

Somehow, though, things get stranger still. As reported by WCYB, a local news station in Virginia, some people were apparently putting sunscreen in their eyes so that they could “safely” look at the eclipse.

Nurse Practioner Trish Patterson told WCYB’s sister station, KRCR, that although she hasn’t seen any patients coming in with eclipse-related ocular damage, she has seen a few people come in after dousing their peep holes in a product that is quite clearly just meant to adorn the skin.

As you might have guessed, sunscreen in the eye doesn’t have the same effect as a lens specifically designed to filter out most wavelengths of light. Too little sunscreen and it’ll burn a little as it oozes around the white sclera of your eyeball. Too much, and you just wouldn’t be able to see anything anyway.

Either way, it’d cause you to cry a lot, which only seems appropriate during an eclipse if you’re overcome with emotion.

You can see where these unfortunate few hospital patients were coming from when they decided to squeeze some SPF 20 unguent into their eyes, but this course of action was about as useful and as sensible as using nail varnish on your tongue, or injecting shampoo into your nostrils. Do not do these things.

Maybe eclipses just bring out the oddest behaviors in people. Plenty thought it was a sign of the apocalypse, if Google Trends is anything to go by. One radio host suggested that the highly predictable astronomical event was actually the work of the Prince of Darkness.

2,The risk from artificial intelligence. ,http://www.iflscience.com/technology/elon-musk-warns-theres-something-we-should-be-more-worried-about-than-north-korea/,"Elon Musk recently tweeted that we may be more at risk from artificial intelligence (AI) than the current nuclear threat by North Korea.

Clearly concerned with the increasing advancement in technology, Musk took to Twitter to voice his fears and deliver a warning to developers, and possible regulators of the industry.

""If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea,"" he wrote.

This comes at a time of increasing tension between North Korea and the USA, in which the threat of nuclear weapons is becoming more and more real with each day. Despite this, Musk believes our greatest threat lies currently in the virtually unregulated AI industry, and as such is now calling for improvements to be made.

-

He followed on from his previous tweet by stating ""everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too.""

Admittedly, AI technology is developing rapidly. OpenAI, a company led by Musk, recently succeeded in reaching a huge milestone in AI progress – an AI bot consistently beat professional human opponents in 1v1 scenarios in the popular video game Dota. This is particularly impressive, as the bot learned how to win solely by repeatedly playing against itself over a period of three months. With minimal human coaching, it was able to learn complex mechanics, alongside exploiting its opponent’s mistakes and adapting to random play styles – achievements far more advanced than the board games tested previously.

This occurred on August 12 at the Grand Finals of The International 7, the largest annual Dota tournament, with a staggering prize pool of nearly $25million and the victory of being watched by nearly 4.7million people.

Whether this game off was for entertainment purposes, or to show the power and speed of progression of current AI technology, we're not sure, but the bot certainly made an impression.

Whilst the warning appears worrying, don’t start running to find a cave to live in just yet, it isn’t the first time Musk has predicted danger from AIs. In 2014, he tweeted:

-

Clearly he hasn’t changed his mind since then, and is still fighting to get across the importance of the issue.

Perhaps with this demonstration, and the rate at which AIs are growing in intelligence, it really is time to begin regulating the industry and collaborating between developers to understand AIs better. After all, if they are actually more dangerous than nukes, we’re going to need all the help we can get.",2017-08-15 14:01:03

4,Kitchen sponge. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/kitchen-sponges-hoard-more-bacteria-than-anywhere-else-in-the-house/,"If you're curious where most of the bacteria lurks in your house, wonder no longer. Kitchen sponges are now the undisputed leaders of bacteria stockpiling.

The research, published in Scientific Reports, looked at the microbial diversity of building environments. Unsurprisingly, they found that a kitchen sponge is a good place for bacteria – after all, it tends to remain rich in water and come into contact with food – but most of us don't know just how much bacteria. Sponges show a local density of 54 billion bacterial cells per cubic centimeter. That is equivalent to the number of bacteria estimated to be in human feces.

“Despite common misconception, it was demonstrated that kitchen environments host more microbes than toilets,” the researchers wrote in the study. “This was mainly due to the contribution of kitchen sponges which were proven to represent the biggest reservoirs of active bacteria in the whole house”

Not only are sponges full of bacteria, they also spread bacteria all around the kitchen when we clean with them. While this might seem utterly disgusting, it’s important to realize that bacteria are everywhere. We have just as many bacterial cells in our body as we have human cells, for example. The focus needs to be on how many dangerous bacteria the sponges harbor.

For this reason, the team produced the first comprehensive analysis of the bacterial microbiome of sponges. They discovered that the most abundant type of bacteria belongs to the Moraxellaceae family, averaging 36 percent across the sample. Moraxellaceae represents the typical human skin bacteria, so we bring them to the sponge, where they multiply and can become potentially dangerous. Most of the bacteria they found was not dangerous, although some were.

""What surprised us was that five of the ten [types] which we most commonly found, belong to the so-called risk group 2 (RG2),"" said lead researcher, microbiologist Markus Egert in a statement, ""which means they are potential pathogens.""

The main three were Acinetobacter johnsonii, Moraxella osloensis, and Chryseobacterium hominis.

The study also looked at how to avoid an overbundance of this bacteria. “Sanitation by boiling or microwave treatment has been shown to significantly reduce the bacterial load of kitchen sponges and can, therefore, be regarded as a reasonable hygiene measure. However, our data showed that regularly sanitized sponges (as indicated by their users) did not contain less bacteria than uncleaned ones.”

The cleaning procedures actually changed the microbiome – and not exactly for the better. Moraxellaceae and Chryseobacterium hominis appeared to increase in number, as they are more resistant than competing bacteria. This suggests that prolonged sanitation of kitchen sponges might have counterproductive effects. The researchers think that to reduce risk, the best option is to replace the sponges regularly.",2017-08-02 08:46:47
5,"Wind and associated pressure waves would flatten everything, including you. #StopClickbait",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/3/15903154/asteroid-death-one-chart,"The chances of dying via an asteroid impact are very, very small.

Asteroids that pose an existential threat to life on Earth only strike once every 500,000 years or more. Even the 140-meter-wide asteroids that could destroy cities and regions rain down death once every 10,000 years. (Though, to note: One of this approximate size just sailed past the Earth, coming within 45,000 miles of our planet, to the surprise of scientists who didn’t see it coming.)

The risk of being even injured from a 20-meter object — like the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 and hurt nearly 1,500 people — is tiny.

But, okay: WHAT IF? If a huge asteroid were to smash into Earth, what would happen to us? We all know Hollywood’s take: Either we’ll be engulfed by a huge fireball or swallowed by a massive tsunami.

The journal Geophysical Research Letters in 2017 published an analysis of the likely source of casualties from an asteroid impact. In it, the scientists ran a computer model where they simulated the impact of 50,000 asteroids — from the very tiny to 400-meter monsters — all over the globe. They estimated how each of the asteroids would create chaos (i.e., if they hit in water, they’d perhaps create a tsunami, if they hit land, they would generate debris and a shockwave), and estimated the causalities of each of the impacts based on the population density in the area.

In sum, here’s what they found: If you’re going to die via an asteroid, it will be the wind and shockwave that gets you.

Surprisingly ""effects such as cratering, seismic shaking and ejecta deposition [i.e., ejected debris] provide only a minor contribution to overall loss,"" the study concluded. If Asteroid 2019 OK — the name of the one that just made a near-miss of the Earth — collided with our planet, most people in the impact area (poor souls) would have died due to wind.

Why wind? It’s because if a large-enough asteroid explodes in the air before hitting the Earth (and generating tsunamis, craters, and fire-filled torrents of death), the resulting shockwave could blast winds powerful enough to flatten cities. The pressure from the blast could rupture internal organs. Bottom line: An asteroid doesn’t have to reach the ground intact to cause chaos. In their analysis, 60 percent of all asteroid deaths were caused by wind and pressure.

The chart above shows that as the asteroids get larger, your chances of dying of anything other than wind increase, but the wind would still the No. 1 cause of death.

Tsunamis aren’t as much of a factor, relatively speaking, because in many areas, the geography of the shoreline would dampen their destructive reach, New Scientist explains in its report on the study. Also: Wind is a factor in every asteroid collision, and tsunamis are only implicated in impacts over water.

So, should this graphic keep you up at night? No.

Talking about the risk of asteroid impact is tricky. We’re not likely to see a huge destructive asteroid in our lifetimes. Those threaten future generations. “You have to think about the risk in terms of it’s not a risk to a person or a city, but a risk to humanity,” said Eric Christensen, who hunts asteroids for NASA at the Catalina Sky Survey.

Small asteroid strikes are much more likely. But for one to land near you would be an incredible stroke of bad luck.

“One of the most remarkable things about the Chelyabinsk impactor for me was that it happened over a populated area,” Christensen says. “Ninety-eight percent of the planet is unpopulated or very sparsely populated.”

And that’s why NASA’s tracking these baddies now. The more we keep an eye on them, the more we can devise engineering solutions to push a deadly asteroid off a collision course. The Center for Near Earth Object Studies at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory has logged around 18,000 asteroids that come close to Earth’s orbital neighborhood. And there are thousands more to find.

6,"The article doesn't actually say it outright, but it is suggesting every 1-2 weeks. .",http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/how-often-you-should-wash-your-bed-sheets-according-to-a-microbiologist-and-what-happens-when-you-dont/,"We spend more than a third of our lives in bed — but that place can quickly blossom into a ""botanical park"" of bacteria and fungus, according to New York University microbiologist Philip Tierno.

If left for too long, the microscopic life within the wrinkles and folds of our bed sheets can even make us sick, Tierno told Business Insider.

To stem the invisible tide, he said, sheets should be washed once a week.

Humans naturally produce roughly 26 gallons of sweat in bed every year. When it's hot and humid outside, this moisture becomes what scientists call an ""ideal fungal culture medium.""

In a recent study that assessed the level of fungal contamination in bedding, researchers found that a test sample of feather and synthetic pillows that were 1 1/2 to 20 years old contained as many as 16 species of fungus each.

And it's not just your own microbial life you're sleeping with. In addition to the fungi and bacteria that come from your sweat, sputum, skin cells, and vaginal and anal excretions, you also share your bed with foreign microbes. These include animal dander, pollen, soil, lint, dust mite debris and feces, and finishing agents from whatever your sheets are made from, to name a few.

Tierno says all that gunk becomes ""significant"" in as little as a week. And unclean bedding still exposes you to materials that can trigger the sniffing and sneezing, since the microbes are so close to your mouth and nose that you're almost forced to breathe them in.

""Even if you don't have allergies per se, you can have an allergic response,"" Tierno said.

Another reason your sheets get dirty quickly has little to do with your behavior or sweat patterns — the issue is simply gravity.

""Just like Rome over time was buried with the debris that falls from gravity, gravity is what brings all that material into your mattress,"" Tierno said.

One to two weeks of this buildup is enough to leave anyone with a scratchy throat — especially those with significant allergies or asthma. (One in six Americans has allergies.)

""If you touched dog poo in the street, you'd want to wash your hands,"" Tierno said. ""Consider that analogous to your bedding. If you saw what was there — but of course you don't see it — after a while you have to say to yourself, 'Do I want to sleep in that?'""

That’s what’s illustrated (in graphic detail) in the video at the top of this story.

Story continues below advertisement

I’m not trying to provoke panic about watching the solar eclipse. Hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions — of people across the United States are going to walk outside Aug. 21, look up, and see something truly spectacular. That’s something I look forward to.

Advertisement

But because I’m curious (and quite a few people have asked), I thought it would be interesting to talk about what would happen if you tried to look at the sun during the eclipse. And don’t tell me it doesn’t happen and people know better. That’s not true.

According to an expert answer on the University of California at Santa Barbara ScienceLine, ” … doctors collect information after events like the 1999 solar eclipse, when people who stared directly at the sun for several minutes went to see their doctor. In one study, about half had permanent damage.”

Story continues below advertisement

An assessment after the same eclipse in Britain found fewer cases than they had feared, but 14 people still managed to damage their eyes by staring at the eclipse.

There’s even a tale that Isaac Newton stared at the sun with one eye (for the sake of science, of course), and afterward he could only see reds and blues. I have no idea if that is fiction or fact, but it sure makes a good story.

Want to watch the eclipse safely? Here’s how it will go …

… if you’re in the path of totality:

It will start as a partial eclipse as the moon begins to cover the sun. Keep your glasses on at this point.

When the sun is totally blocked by the moon, you can take your glasses off! Enjoy. It’s beautiful.

Story continues below advertisement

Once sunlight starts to appear again, as the moon departs, put your glasses back on and enjoy the partial eclipse.

… if you’re not in the path of totality:

You’ll only be seeing a partial eclipse. There will be harmful sun rays for the duration of the event. Keep your eclipse glasses on through the whole thing.

Yes, you will go blind if you manage to endure the pain and stare at the sun for long enough. The pain from the visible part of the light spectrum could be extreme, but ultraviolet light — which we can’t see — can also damage the eye. It literally gives your eye a sunburn.

The reason a few people always end up going blind during an eclipse is that in the partial phase, the visible light is reduced enough that it’s no longer painful or uncomfortable to look at and so people assume it’s safe. But depending on the sky conditions, it only takes about a minute and a half for your eyes to be permanently damaged, and the damage is cumulative, meaning you don’t have to stare at the sun without looking away for it to be harmful — you may just be taking quick glances, but it’s still damaging your eye.

If your eyes are damaged, your vision will at least be blurry and you may see dark or yellow spots. If it’s significant damage, you may not be able to see out of the center of your eye — only your peripheral vision.

Other things you should be aware of: Some drugs dilate your pupils, which will decrease the amount of time it will take to burn the eye. People taking these drugs should always take care to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Also, looking through a camera lens or a telescope will not protect your eyes. The latter is blatantly obvious in the video. Unless it has a filter on it that is made specifically for blocking out the harmful rays, you should not look through any lenses.",2017-07-02 11:00:28
8,Far less than 0.01% increase in cancer risk (for the average flyer). ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/air-travel-exposes-you-to-radiation-how-much-health-risk-comes-with-it/all/,"This past April, business traveler Tom Stuker became the world’s most frequent flyer, logging 18,000,000 miles of air travel on United Airlines over the last 14 years.

That’s a lot of time up in the air. If Stuker’s traveling behaviors are typical of other business flyers, he may have eaten 6,500 inflight meals, drunk 5,250 alcoholic beverages, watched thousands of inflight movies and made around 10,000 visits to airplane toilets.

He would also have accumulated a radiation dose equivalent to about 1,000 chest x-rays. But what kind of health risk does all that radiation actually pose?

Cosmic rays coming at you

You might guess that a frequent flyer’s radiation dose is coming from the airport security checkpoints, with their whole-body scanners and baggage x-ray machines, but you’d be wrong. The radiation doses to passengers from these security procedures are trivial.

The major source of radiation exposure from air travel comes from the flight itself. This is because at high altitude the air gets thinner. The farther you go from the Earth’s surface, the fewer molecules of gas there are per volume of space. Thinner air thus means fewer molecules to deflect incoming cosmic rays – radiation from outer space. With less atmospheric shielding, there is more exposure to radiation.

The most extreme situation is for astronauts who travel entirely outside of the Earth’s atmosphere and enjoy none of its protective shielding. Consequently, they receive high radiation doses. In fact, it is the accumulation of radiation dose that is the limiting factor for the maximum length of manned space flights. Too long in space and astronauts risk cataracts, cancer and potential heart ailments when they get back home.

Indeed, it’s the radiation dose problem that is a major spoiler for Elon Musk’s goal of inhabiting Mars. An extended stay on Mars, with its extremely thin atmosphere, would be lethal due to the high radiation doses, notwithstanding Matt Damon’s successful Mars colonization in the movie “The Martian.”

Radiation risks of ultra frequent flying

What would be Stuker’s cumulative radiation dose and what are his health risks?

It depends entirely on how much time he has spent in the air. Assuming an average flight speed (550 mph), Stuker’s 18,000,000 miles would translate into 32,727 hours (3.7 years) of flight time. The radiation dose rate at typical commercial airline flight altitude (35,000 feet) is about 0.003 millisieverts per hour. (As I explain in my book “Strange Glow: The Story of Radiation,” a millisievert or mSv is a unit of radiation dose that can be used to estimate cancer risk.) By multiplying the dose rate by the hours of flight time, we can see that Stuker has earned himself about 100 mSv of radiation dose, in addition to a lot of free airline tickets. But what does that mean for his health?

The primary health threat at this dose level is an increased risk of some type of cancer later in life. Studies of atomic bomb victims, nuclear workers and medical radiation patients have allowed scientists to estimate the cancer risk for any particular radiation dose.

All else being equal and assuming that low doses have risk levels proportionate to high doses, then an overall cancer risk rate of 0.005 percent per mSv is a reasonable and commonly used estimate. Thus, Stuker’s 100-mSv dose would increase his lifetime risk of contracting a potentially fatal cancer by about 0.5 percent.

Contextualizing the risk

The question then becomes whether that’s a high level of risk. Your own feeling might depend on how you see your background cancer risk.

Most people underestimate their personal risk of dying from cancer. Although the exact number is debatable, it’s fair to say that about 25 percent of men ultimately contract a potentially fatal cancer. Stuker’s 0.5 percent cancer risk from radiation should be added to his baseline risk – so it would go from 25 percent to 25.5 percent. A cancer risk increase of that size is too small to actually measure in any scientific way, so it must remain a theoretical increase in risk.

A 0.5 percent increase in risk is the same as one chance in 200 of getting cancer. In other words, if 200 male travelers logged 18,000,000 miles of air travel, like Stuker did, we might expect just one of them to contract a cancer thanks to his flight time. The other 199 travelers would suffer no health effects. So the chances that Stuker is the specific 18-million-mile traveler who would be so unlucky is quite small.

Stuker was logging more air hours per year (greater than 2,000) than most pilots typically log (under 1,000). So these airline workers would have risk levels proportionately lower than Stuker’s. But what about you?

If you want to know your personal cancer risk from flying, estimate all of your commercial airline miles over the years. Assuming that the values and parameters for speed, radiation dose and risk stated above for Stuker are also true for you, dividing your total miles by 3,700,000,000 will give your approximate odds of getting cancer from your flying time.

For example, let’s pretend that you have a mathematically convenient 370,000 total flying miles. That would mean 370,000 miles divided by 3,700,000,000, which comes out to be 1/10,000 odds of contracting cancer (or a 0.01 percent increase in risk). Most people do not fly 370,000 miles (equal to 150 flights from Los Angeles to New York) within their lifetimes. So for the average flyer, the increased risk is far less than 0.01 percent.

To make your exercise complete, make a list of all the benefits that you’ve derived from your air travel over your lifetime (job opportunities, vacation travel, family visits and so on) and go back and look at your increased cancer risk again. If you think your benefits have been meager compared to your elevated cancer risk, maybe its time to rethink flying. But for many people today, flying is a necessity of life, and the small elevated cancer risk is worth the price.

9,Yes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/is-it-ok-to-run-in-heat-of-30-or-more/,"Most of Britain is experiencing a heatwave, with temperatures reaching up to 32℃. The public health watchdog for England has issued an amber health warning, advising people to take care in the hotter weather. But what does it mean for runners? Is it ever too hot to go for a run?

With the recent high temperatures in parts of the UK soaring above 30℃, people may find themselves questioning the safety of running in the heat. Running in hotter temperatures though is not uncommon, with many runners competing in warmer climates such as Kenya, Ethiopia and Japan, where temperatures average 25℃.

But while running in the heat may be considered a risk to some people – such as children, the elderly and pregnant women – as long as precautions are taken, running in temperatures as high as 30-35℃ is fine.

A number of running events take place in extreme heat (over 35℃), such as Badwater, the 135-mile ultra-marathon that takes place in Death Valley, California, where temperatures can sore to over 50℃. There is also the annual Marathon des Sables, a five-day run across the Sahara Desert in Morocco, where temperatures can reach 50℃. This 156-mile run is considered the toughest foot race on Earth. Our experience at Kingston University with people running and training in our heat chamber for events such as the Marathon des Sables and Badwater, demonstrates that with enough preparation, hydration and being sensible about how hard you run, it is possible to run safely in high temperatures. But it is important to note, that these races do take a lot of preparation and acclimatisation and running in such temperatures is certainly not recommended without thorough training.",2017-06-25 10:08:00
10,"1. Your body is more likely to become inflamed as you get older.

2. You drink less water when you're older.

3. Your body isn't as efficient at detoxifying.

",http://www.thisisinsider.com/do-hangovers-get-worse-with-age-why-2017-3,"The INSIDER Summary:

According to Dr. Ralph Holsworth, hangovers do get worse with age.

There are three reasons for this.

Your body is more likely to become inflamed when you're older, you drink less water when you're older, and your body isn't as efficient at detoxifying.



Ever wondered why you can't drink the way you used to in college?

Turns out there's actual science to back up why you feel hungover after two beers when you used to be able to handle five.

According to Dr. Ralph Holsworth, an osteopathic family medicine physician and director of clinical and scientific research for Essentia Water, hangovers do unfortunately worsen with age.

Dr. Holsworth attributes that to three main reasons.

Your body is more likely to become inflamed when you're older.

As you get older, your body goes into what Dr. Holsworth refers to as a ""pro-inflammatory state."" What he means by that is your body is more likely to become inflamed.

Inflammation is what happens to your body when it's trying to fight off an infection or heal itself in some way. When you drink, your body identifies the alcohol you consume as a chemical toxin, which then causes inflammation throughout the body.

Although inflammation is technically a good thing because it means you're healing, it's not a comfortable state for your body to be in. It often causes pain and swelling, and is partly to blame for your hangover symptoms. And because your body is more likely to become inflamed the older you get, the discomfort you feel due to a hangover will only increase with age.

You drink less water the older you get.

According to Dr. Holsworth, your body's ""thirst drive,"" or its cues to drink water, decrease with age. Alcohol already dehydrates you — which then causes you to feel like death the next day — so if you start out a night of drinking without being properly hydrated, your hangover symptoms are only going to be worse the next day.

Your body becomes less efficient at detoxifying as you get older.

Your body identifies alcohol as a toxin. So processing the alcohol you drink involves a complex method of detoxification. The liver is crucial in this process, and according to Dr. Holsworth, liver function decreases with age.

That means that when you're older, your liver just doesn't work as efficiently as it used to. Because of that, it becomes harder for your body to process alcohol.",2017-06-15 08:19:22

12,To conserve energy. ,http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/why-flamingos-stand-on-one-leg/,"The reason it looks so easy is because, for them, it is. Natalia Barsukova/Shutterstock

Flamingos are basically the models of the animal kingdom. They’re tall, slim, a fabulous color, and know how to strike a pose.

Now, scientists think they have unraveled the mysteries of why and how the feathery pink wonders assume this iconic position: It turns out flamingos can conserve more energy standing on one leg than two.

Researchers from the US discovered that flamingos’ legs have a mechanism that fixes into place when their legs are straight, meaning they don’t actually expend any muscular activity once they're in place.

Professor Young-Hui Chang of Georgia Institute of Technology and Dr Lena H Ting of Emory University, Atlanta, suspected that the birds’ legs might feature a characteristic that meant their joints could lock into place, but when they studied two donated cadavers from Birmingham Zoo, they couldn't find anything.

However, when Chang picked the bird up by its leg and held it upright, the leg fixed into place, became rigid and held.

“That was the ‘Aha!’ moment when we knew we were on to something special,” Chang told Discover. “If a dead flamingo could do it, then it is probably available for live birds to do.”

Strangely, they found the dead flamingos could not hold the pose when they tried to stand them up on two legs, which led them to suspect it takes more effort for the birds’ muscles to use two legs than just one.

They then studied the balance behaviors of eight live juvenile flamingos from Zoo Atlanta by placing them on a force-plate, basically fancy bathroom scales, and waiting for them to fall asleep. They discovered that when the flamingos were less active, they swayed less on one leg. In fact, when they fell asleep, their postural sway was seven times lower than when they were active.

Their results, published in the journal Biology letters, suggest that the flamingos rely on a passive mechanism for support, not an active one that uses muscular effort.

This seems counterintuitive because as humans we typically think standing on one leg and remaining balanced is rather difficult, requiring a lot of energy, control, and effort. However, as flamingos use their legs more for prolonged standing than running around, for them it is much more energy efficient.

Though the researchers say they need to do further tests to understand the mechanism better, their study could have many practical applications.

13,Vehicles will not protect you from the nuclear fallout. ,http://www.thisisinsider.com/survive-nuclear-attack-fallout-shelter-cars-2017-5?utm_content=buffere5967&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer,"Nuclear blasts create fallout, which can harm you with large doses of radiation.

Cars offer little protection from fallout.

A surer way to survive in the aftermath of a nuclear explosion is to go indoors, stay put, and listen to the radio.

The first thing you'd see if a nuclear bomb exploded nearby is a flood of light so bright, you may think the sun blew up.

Wincing from temporary blindness, you'd scan the horizon and see an orange fireball. The gurgling flames would rise and darken into purple-hued column of black smoke, which would turn in on itself. As a toadstool-like mushroom took shape, the deafening shock front of the blast would rip through the area — and possibly knock you off your feet.

Congratulations! In this hypothetical scenario, you've just survived a nuclear blast with an energy output of about 10 kilotons (20 million pounds) of TNT. That's roughly 66% of energy released by either atom bomb dropped on Japan in 1945.

This scenario may sound far-fetched, but more than 14,900 nuclear weapons exist in the world, and kiloton-class nukes (like the one we just described) are now proliferating in weapons stockpiles. In fact, a 10-kiloton-or-less nuclear detonation by a terrorist is the first of 15 disaster scenarios that the US government has planned for

No one could fault you for panicking after the sight and roar of a nuclear blast. But there is one thing you should never do, according to Brooke Buddemeier, a health physicist and radiation expert at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

""Don't get in your car,"" he tells Business Insider — don't try to drive, and don't assume that the glass and metal of a vehicle can protect you.

Why vehicles and nuclear survival don't mix

Avoiding driving after a nuclear blast is wise because streets would probably be full of erratic drivers, accidents, and debris. But Buddemeier says there's another important reason to ditch the car: a fearsome after-effect of nuclear blasts called fallout.

Fallout is a complex mixture of fission products, or radioisotopes, that are created by splitting atoms. Many of the fission products decay rapidly and emit gamma radiation, an invisible yet highly energetic form of light. Exposure to too much of this radiation in a short time can damage the body's cells and its ability to fix itself — a condition called acute radiation sickness.

""It also affects the immune system and the your ability to fight infections,"" Buddemeier says.

Only very dense and thick materials, like many feet of dirt or inches of lead, can reliably stop the fallout.

""The fireball from a 10-kiloton explosion is so hot, it actually shoots up into the atmosphere at over 100 miles per hour,"" Buddemeier says. ""These fission products mix in with the dirt and debris that's drawn up into the atmosphere from the fireball.""

Trapped in sand, dirt, cement, metal, and anything else in the immediate blast area, the gamma-shooting fission products can fly more than five miles into the air. The larger pieces drop back down, while lighter particles can be carried by the wind before raining over distant areas.

""Close in to the [blast] site, they may be a bit larger than golf-ball-size, but really what we're talking about are things like salt- or sand-size particles,"" Buddemeier says. ""It's the penetrating gamma radiation coming off of those particles that's the hazard.""

Which brings us back to why a car is a terrible place to take shelter.

""Modern vehicles are made of glass and very light metals, and they offer almost no protection,"" he says. ""You're just going to sit on a road some place [and be exposed].""

Buddemeier says he's asked people what their knee-jerk response to a nuclear blast might be. It wasn't comforting.

""There was actually a lot of folks who had this notion — and it may be a Hollywood notion — of 'oh, jump in the car and try to skedaddle out of town if you see a mushroom cloud.'"" he says.

However, fallout is carried by high-altitude winds that are ""often booking along at 100 miles per hour,"" he says, and ""often not going in the same direction as the ground-level winds. So your ability to know where the fallout's gonna go, and outrun it, are… Well, it's very unlikely.""

What you should do instead of driving

The protection factor that various buildings, and locations within them, offer from the radioactive fallout of a nuclear blast. The higher the number, the greater the protection. Brooke Buddemeier/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

Your best shot at survival after a nuclear disaster is to get into some sort of ""robust structure"" as quickly as possible and stay there, Buddemeier says. He's a fan of the mantra ""go in, stay in, tune in"".

""Get inside ... and get to the center of that building. If you happen to have access to below-ground areas, getting below-ground is great,"" he says. ""Stay in: 12 to 24 hours.""

The reason to wait is that levels of gamma and other radiation fall off exponentially after a nuclear blast as ""hot"" radioisotopes decay into more stable atoms and pose less of a danger. This slowly shrinks the dangerous fallout zone — the area where high-altitude winds have dropped fission products. (Instead of staying put, however, a recent study also suggested that moving to a stronger shelter or basement may not be a bad idea if you first ducked into a flimsy one.)

The dangerous fallout zone (dark purple) shrinks quickly, while the much less dangerous hot zone (faint purple) grows for about 24 hours before shrinking back. Brooke Buddemeier/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

Finally, tune in.

""Try to use whatever communication tools you have,"" he says. He added that a hand-cranked radio is a good object to keep at work and home, since emergency providers, in addition to broadcasting instructions, will be tracking the fallout cloud and trying to broadcast where any safe corridors for escape are located.

There is only one exception to the ""no cars"" rule, says Buddemeier: If you're in a parking garage with your car, the concrete might act as a shield. In that case, you could stay there and listen to a radio inside your car.

If everyone followed these guidelines after nuclear blast, he says, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved.",2017-05-25 07:29:15
14,Strawberries. ,https://www.aol.com/article/lifestyle/2017/03/21/strawberries-pesticides/21904539/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00001392,"Just because it's fruit, doesn't mean it's healthy.

Every year, over 3 billion pounds of strawberries are produced by the United States, constituting a nearly 3 billion dollar business. California is responsible for producing over 90% of the strawberry crop in America, while Florida grows the second most amount. While experts believe the production and consumption of strawberries will continue to grow each year, many are warning of its dangers.

Once again, strawberries have topped the ""Dirty Dozen"" list -- they are hailed as the fruit ""most likely to be contaminated with pesticide residues even after they are picked, rinsed in the field and washed before eating"", according to the Environmental Working Group (EWG). Other produce listed includes spinach, nectarines, apples and potatoes.

How to store every single type of fruit:

The takeaways from the EWG are quite apparent.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture found that strawberries contained nearly 8 pesticides per sample. That's more than any other sample of produce, which contained 2.3 pesticides per sample, in comparison. Scientists found that nearly 30% of strawberries had residues of more than 10 pesticides, with the ""dirtiest"" linked to 21 different pesticides.

If that doesn't deter you enough to eat organic strawberries, scientists found traces of poisonous gas on strawberries as well. These included mostly Carbendazim and Bifenthrin, which was found on 33% of the strawberry samples. These harmful chemicals have been associated with a variety of health issues, including cancer, developmental and reproductive damage, and neurological problems.

In light of this report, nutritionists are advising their clients to ""shop smart"".

""I believe that this is an important source of information,"" said Corinne Bush to CNN. Consequently, the EWG says that buyers should look for organic produce.

""Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables is essential no matter how they're grown, but for the items with the heaviest pesticide loads, we urge shoppers to buy organic. If you can't buy organic, the Shopper's Guide will steer you to conventionally grown produce that is the lowest in pesticides,"" said EWG analyst Sonya Lunder.

15,Aerobic exercise done for at least 45 minutes at a time. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-the-single-best-type-of-exercise-for-your-brain-according-to-scientists,"Want an all-natural way to lift your mood, improve your memory, and protect your brain against age-related cognitive decline? Get moving.

A wealth of recent research, including two new studies published this spring, suggests that any type of exercise that raises your heart rate and gets you moving and sweating for a sustained period of time - known as aerobic exercise - has a significant, overwhelmingly beneficial impact on the brain.

""Aerobic exercise is the key for your head, just as it is for your heart,"" write the authors of a recent article in the Harvard Medical School blog, Mind and Mood.

While some of the benefits, like a lift in mood, can emerge as soon as a few minutes into a sweaty bike ride, others, like improved memory, might take several weeks to crop up.

That means that the best type of fitness for your mind is any aerobic exercise that you can do regularly and consistently for at least 45 minutes at a time.

Depending on which benefits you're looking for, you might try adding a brisk walk or a jog to your daily routine. A pilot study in people with severe depression found that just 30 minutes of treadmill walking for 10 consecutive days was ""sufficient to produce a clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in depression.""

Aerobic workouts can also help people who aren't suffering from clinical depression feel less stressed by helping to reduce levels of the body's natural stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, according to a recent study in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science.

If you're over 50, a study published last month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggests the best results come from combining aerobic and resistance exercise.

That could include anything from high-intensity interval training, like the 7-minute workout, to dynamic flow yoga, which intersperses strength-building poses like planks and push-ups with heart-pumping dance-like moves.

Another study published on May 3 provides some additional support to that research, finding that in adults aged 60-88, walking for 30 minutes four days a week for 12 weeks appeared to strengthen connectivity in a region of the brain where weakened connections have been linked with memory loss.

Researchers still aren't sure why this type of exercise appears to provide a boost to the brain, but studies suggest it has to do with increased blood flow, which provides our minds with fresh energy and oxygen.

And one recent study in older women who displayed potential symptoms of dementia found that aerobic exercise was linked with an increase in the size of the hippocampus, a brain area involved in learning and memory.

Joe Northey, the lead author of the British study and an exercise scientist at the University of Canberra, says his research suggests that anyone in good health over age 50 should do 45 minutes to an hour of aerobic exercise ""on as many days of the week as feasible"".

16,No.,http://www.pcgamer.com/are-wifi-signals-bad-for-my-health/,"Yes, we know that the idea of radio waves permeating through your residence does engender everything from concerns of inducing headaches, to increases in cancer, and even mind control. This is all enough for a select few to put on their tin foil hats, and move to Green Bank, West Virginia, the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) where all wireless transmissions are tightly controlled to facilitate scientific research. However, before we toss out our routers and pack our bags, let’s look at this a little more objectively.

The concerns go back over decade, and the potential disease was termed Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS). While not specific to wifi, individuals claimed vague symptoms to any source of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, and cellphone transmissions. The symptoms of EHS are all nonspecific, and included headaches, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, fatigue, tiredness and tingling. It should be realized that among medical professionals, this is currently not an accepted diagnosis, and currently has no treatment.

The very use of the term radiation brings up concern for health. However realize that WiFi is a non-ionizing radiation, as opposed to the ionizing radiation that is associated with nuclear plants, and X-rays. Furthermore, WiFi is closely regulated by the government, and devices have to comply to the low transmission standards of 100 milliwatts, which is why the range is quite limited.

Rather than sitting next to our wireless router, and waiting for a headache, we decided to peruse the medical literature for an answer to how real any potential health concerns from WiFi.

Research in this area gets done with “Sham WiFi,” where willing subjects are told they are being exposed to WiFi, which in some cases they are, and in other cases they are not. Researchers then look for a correlation to see if the symptoms of EHS can be associated with the actual WiFi exposure. Across multiple studies, including a review of thirty-one studies in this area published in Electromagnetics , there was no clear correlation found.

This leaves us wondering what is really going on here. It appears that this is a version of the “placebo effect,” with suggestible folks being convinced of the health detriments of wireless signals, but not confirmed by scientific research. Another study that came out this earlier this year suggests that media reports of potential symptoms from Wi-Fi may prime folks to develop these symptoms.

So, the bottom line on this is that there is no scientific evidence to support symptoms from WiFi. Therefore, cancel your travel plans to the NRQZ, put that tin foil hat back in the drawer, and keep using the wireless router.

17,"Trump: ""Send someone into space in 2019 instead of 2021 like you planned.""

NASA: ""No.""

",http://www.iflscience.com/space/nasa-wont-launch-humans-to-space-in-trumps-first-term/,"NASA has reaffirmed that it will not launch humans into space again until 2021, after the Trump administration asked them to look into bringing it forward to 2019.

The agency is currently developing its huge new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which will be used to one day launch astronauts to Mars.

In 2019, NASA is planning to launch the rocket for the first time with an unmanned Orion spacecraft on top, known as Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1), on a three-week mission around the Moon and back. A manned flight is scheduled to follow in 2021, called Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2).

However, the Trump administration had asked if NASA would consider putting a crew on the first flight – which would put it in Trump's first term. NASA looked into this, and has come back with a firm “no”.

“After evaluating cost, risk, and technical factors in a project of this magnitude, it is difficult to accommodate changes needed for a crewed EM-1 mission at this time,” NASA’s acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot, told employees in an email seen by The Verge.

In a press conference on Friday, Lightfoot said it would cost between $600 million and $900 million to put a two-person crew on EM-1. That’s because the spacecraft would need to be upgraded with life support systems, a launch abort system, and more.

“It really reaffirmed the baseline plan we had in place was the best way for us to go,” he said. “Leave EM-1 uncrewed.”

The Orion capsule will be used to launch and land astronauts. NASA

Trump had previously joked about the possibility of sending humans to Mars by 2024, so that it would take place in his potential second term (shudder). That has not really been taken seriously though, with the idea very much off the table.

“They have not asked us to go to Mars by 2024,” Lightfoot said in the press conference.

EM-1 has had a few problems so far, having been pushed back from 2018 to 2019 recently. And part of the rocket was damaged last week when it was accidentally dropped.

Once it does get up and running, though, the SLS will be the most powerful rocket in operation. And it will eventually eclipse the most powerful rocket of all time, the Saturn V.

This first launch is known as Block 1, and has a lifting capability of 70,000 kilograms (154,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit. Block 2, a bigger version of the SLS, will be able to carry 130,000 kilograms (287,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit.

Of course, this is not the only heavy-lift rocket in development. SpaceX is developing its Falcon Heavy rocket, which it intends to use to send humans around the Moon in 2018 and also for unmanned missions to Mars starting in 2020.

And SpaceX and Boeing will start launching astronauts to space, some for NASA, as early as next year.",2017-05-15 09:55:49

It was completely unnecessary and probably made it worse. A new study has found that simply applying vinegar to the sting, followed by heat, is the best solution regardless of what species has stung you, going against decades of first aid procedures.

The current protocols recommended for stings by the man o’ war jellyfish (Physalia physalis), and its closely related counterpart, the bluebottle (Physalia utriculus), involve washing the affected area with salt water before scraping away the tentacles and applying an ice pack, in order to lessen the impact of the sting. It turns out that this is just about the worst thing you could do.

The process of scraping away tentacles has been found to apply more pressure to the area, which increased the firing of stinging capsules, meaning more venom was injected. Washing in salt water was found to spread the sting over the skin, increasing the area of skin that is actually stung. Adding ice packs to the region just made the pain even worse, reports a new study published in the journal Toxins.

Instead, the researchers found that the general treatment recommended for all other jellyfish stings, namely dowsing the affected area in vinegar, was equally as effective for man o’ wars. Not only that, but the researchers claim that the addition of heat to the stung skin – around 45 minutes of 45°C water or a heat pad – effectively inactivated the venom that had already been injected.

It has long been thought that species of jellyfish belonging to Physalia, which are not technically jellyfish but actually a colony of zooids, require different treatment to the blanket first aid practices recommended for true jellies. Yet after looking at why doctors recommend salt water and ice, and other old wives tale remedies that have risen up, such as lemon juice, shaving foam, and the infamous pee, researchers from Hawaii and Ireland could find no real evidence to back the claims up.

“Without solid science to back up medical practices, we have ended up with conflicting official recommendations around the world, leading to confusion and, in many cases, practices that actually worsen stings or even cost lives,” explained Angel Yanagihara, the senior author of the paper. To test the effectiveness of various treatments, the researchers used sheep and human blood cells in agar.

The research was carried out using the same methods as an earlier study looking into box jellyfish, and will now use it again to test lion’s mane jellies, to see if the same treatment really does hold true over a wide range of species.",2017-05-11 12:31:21
20,Higher production of innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) due to lower levels of testosterone. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/why-women-are-more-likely-to-get-asthma-than-men/,"She may look suspiciously at the pollen-producing tree, but it's not just making her life a misery, it's engaging in sexual descrimination while it does it. Nicoleta Ionescu/Shutterstock

Last year, Melbourne, Australia, experienced an unprecedented “thunderstorm asthma” event. Some 10,000 people were rushed to the hospital, struggling to breathe, with at least nine deaths. No breakdown has been published, but if this resembled most other such events, two-thirds of those affected were women. Adult women are roughly twice as likely to suffer asthma as men, even though boys get it more frequently than girls. Now, a research institution based in the heart of Melbourne has laid the blame for this difference with testosterone.

The hormone testosterone gets blamed, or credited, with all sorts of differences between men and women, often falsely. However, Dr Cyril Seillet and colleagues at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute found it also plays an unexpected role in asthma.

In the Journal of Experimental Medicine, the researchers report that testosterone suppresses the production of innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Since ILC2s can react to pollen, dust mites, or cigarette smoke by producing inflammatory proteins that trigger asthma attacks, the reduction in these cells that men experience after puberty makes them less likely to suffer the attacks. “In males, you have less ILC2s in the lungs and this directly correlates with the reduced severity of asthma,"" Seillet said in a statement.

The discovery makes finding other ways to suppress ILC2s a natural line of research to tackle the rising rates of asthma. ""Current treatments for severe asthma, such as steroids, are very broad based and can have significant side effects,"" said co-author Professor Gabrielle Belz.

Seillet told IFLScience the researchers are looking for compounds that modulate ILC2s without the effects testosterone has on other tissues in the body. He said that a number of molecules already used for other purposes have potential, and testing is underway.

Naturally, ILC2s would not have survived in the body if their effects were entirely negative, and their reaction to dust mites gives a hint of their evolutionary function. Seillet told IFLScience they have an important role in protecting against parasite infections, as well as having an influence on obesity. Theoretically, it might be expected that men's lower ILC2 production would increase vulnerability to parasites, but Seillet said this has yet to be investigated.

Seillet added that ILC2s and testosterone are not the whole story when it comes to explaining asthma. “Asthma is multifactorial,” he told IFLScience. “It is triggered by environmental cues and influenced by genetic background.” However, Seillet and his colleagues investigated the difference observed between rates in men and women, for which testosterone's influence on ILC2s proved explanatory.",2017-05-11 10:00:00

The world's most popular password is the disappointingly easy-to-guess 123456, according to a massive analysis of 10 million leaked passwords.

Throughout 2016, we saw numerous major data breaches leaking people's login details online. Some were new — like the hack of adult dating site AdultFriendFinder — while others, like LinkedIn, were years-old, but the data only recently surfaced online.

In both cases, these breaches have provided researchers with an unparalleled look at the security habits of millions of people — and it's not pretty.

Security firm Keeper trawled through 10 million records that leaked in 2016, and found that a shocking 17% of people used the basic, insecure password 123456. (We heard about the analysis via The Register.)

In second place was the barely better 123456789, followed by the predictable qwerty. Then came 12345678, and in fifth place was the insecure 111111.

""Looking at the list of 2016’s most common passwords, we couldn’t stop shaking our heads,"" the researchers wrote in a blog post. ""Four of the top 10 passwords on the list — and seven of the top 15 — are six characters or shorter. This is stunning in light of the fact that, as we’ve reported, today’s brute-force cracking software and hardware can unscramble those passwords in seconds. Website operators that permit such flimsy protection are either reckless or lazy.""

What's more, Keeper says, recommendations about good security practices are just failing to get through to a lot of people.

""The list of most-frequently used passwords has changed little over the past few years,"" it writes. ""That means that user education has limits. While it’s important for users to be aware of risks, a sizable minority are never going to take the time or effort to protect themselves. IT administrators and website operators must do the job for them.""

Longer passwords can be harder to remember. But that's not an excuse to just use qwerty. Security experts recommend that people use a different, strong password for each service or website they have an account with, storing them with a password manager app if necessary. That way, if one service you used is breached, your accounts on others aren't compromised as well.

And you should also activate two-factor authentication whenever possible, so that even if your password is exposed, attackers still can't get into your account without access to your phone.

On a long enough timescale, everyone gets hacked. But by not using — and re-using — weak passwords, you can limit the damage.

23,"They are referred to as ""printer color blocks."" They identify which colors of ink are used in the package design. ",http://mentalfloss.com/article/51286/what-are-colored-circles-food-packages,"There's a lot of information crammed onto food packaging these days, and along with all of the helpful stuff (like nutritional data and ingredients), there's also the mysterious, multicolored row of circles or squares that serves a very important purpose ... for the printer.

Referred to as “printer's color blocks” or “process control patches,” this grid of color swatches indicates which hues of ink were used to produce the design on the package. The printer checks these colored circles or squares to determine whether a package conforms to the necessary color scheme for the product. In the case of any problems, the color blocks let both the human and computerized printers know if a deficiency (or surplus) of color caused the issue.

The color blocks are usually pictured as circles on most bagged products and squares on boxed goods, with the most common being black, cyan, magenta, and yellow, since they're the basis of most colors produced by printers. If the bulk of the package is printed in one or two other colors, they'll usually turn up in their own blocks (called “spot colors”), too. Bags of Cheetos, for example, will almost always have at least one orange block, but usually two or more in different hues.

If you don't see a set of color blocks on your bag of chips or box of cookies, you don't need to worry. The decision to include this element is an option, not a rule—though most large-scale, mass-produced products have some variation of color blocks on their packages. Some companies also crop off the color blocks during the packaging process.

Oh, and if you see the color blocks, you'll probably find a symbol that looks like the cross-hairs of a rifle scope somewhere on the package, too. These “register marks” (or “position marks”) are used to align all of the colors printed on the packaging—yet another helpful tool for the printer, but not really of any use to consumers.",2017-05-09 09:46:31
24,Yes. ,http://mentalfloss.com/article/500682/do-we-really-need-wash-our-hands,"Humans have a host of invisible companions: trillions of microbes, which live both inside of us and on us. Don't run to the shower just yet—keep in mind that some of these microbes may actually be your friends.

Contrary to popular belief, microbes don’t always cause disease. As Gross Science host Anna Rothschild explains in the video below, some healthy strains of skin bacteria may actually kill certain disease-causing bacteria, or train our immune systems to fight off future infections. Which makes us wonder, if some microbes are good for us, should we stop washing our hands?

The answer is “absolutely not.” Thanks to antibiotics, modern industrial living, and changes in diet, we’ve lost many of the beneficial microbes that may have become part of our immune systems during our early evolution. As such, this has opened us up to some of the less helpful ones, which can actually make us sick.

Since everyone gets a little dirty from time to time, scientists suggest practicing “targeted hygiene,” where we focus on our biggest germ targets. Since we use our hands to interact with people, animals, and nature, they are, understandably, pretty germy. So we should wash them often—and thoroughly—in order to prevent the spread of illness.

Because the jury is still out on which microbes are good or bad for us, it's best to err on the safe side by adopting this World Health Organization-endorsed six-step hand washing technique.",2017-05-08 08:45:00

But why is her color green? Keep reading to find out what everyone is saying.

One theory as to why they're green comes from Time , who say that it may be because of an over-exposure to biliverdin, which is a green pigment in the placenta.

Thankfully, according to Life with Dogs , it's not a health concern at all. Kind of sad, but it fades after a few weeks. But Fiona will always be known as the green pup!

26,It's an invasive species called giant hogweed. Its sap causes horrible blisters. Snopes and other details in comments. ,http://realfarmacy.com/dont-touch-plant/,"They should teach this in school but unfortunately just like most important life skills it is up to us to educate our children and each other so make sure you SHARE this! The plant is called giant hogweed and the pretty white flowers can be quite alluring, but whatever you do make no mistake touching it!

Kids are especially in danger due to curiosity.

This might come as a surprise, but there are only about 10 plants in North America (not including fungi) that kids need to know to steer clear of. Currently, kids are too busy preparing for and taking tests, something nations excelling at education such as Finland don’t do (source), rather than learning practical knowledge such as how to identify poison oak or worse, hogweed!

So spread the word and teach your kids. Here’s what you should know:

Interestingly, the giant hogweed is part of the Carrot family and can grow up to 14 ft tall loaded with deadly toxic sap!

The results of merely brushing up against it are horrifying. If you accidentally break a stem or touch any of the sap you will begin to develop grotesque blisters! Due to the height of the stalk this is easy to accidentally do. Characteristics to watch out for include green stems with purple patches that are a bit hairy with white hairs.

According to Ask a Prepper:

If you come into contact with the plant’s sap you can expect severe blistering, possible blindness if it comes into contact with your eyes and possible third degree burns. These effects come from the type of chemicals that it contains. When these chemicals come in contact with human skin they dramatically increase the skin’s sensitivity to light.

This can cause blisters that are actually very painful and form within around 48 hours and can last from anywhere between a few months to six years. It can cause LONG TERM sensitivity to light if the sap gets in the eye.

Measures to Take if You or Your Child Comes in Contact With It

Obviously you want to avoid it in the first place but what if you happen to come in contact with giant hogweed?

Immediately wash the affected area with cold water. Make haste because the toxic reaction may begin within only 15 minutes and make sure you get out of the sun!

Apply a safe sunscreen on the effected area ASAP. It’s always good to have some of this excellent DIY recipe on hand just in case.

In the unfortunate event that the sap comes in contact with your eyes, immediately flush with water extensively. Then be sure to wear sunglasses for protection!

Recently some states made public warnings after these plants were spotted. The Blaze reported:

In recent weeks, New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation and the state of Massachusetts have issued detailed public warnings about the plant and the serious problems caused by coming in contact with it. These two states are not alone. In the northeastern region, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine are all reporting sightings of the plant. Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan are sending out warnings. Out west, Oregon and Washington have seen giant hogweed spreading.

How to Get Rid Of It

If you do spot it you have the option to report it to the EPA (US Environmental Protection Agency) hotline – 1-800-424-8802or your individual state agency as suggested. Officials warn not to remove the plant yourself or may risk spreading seeds.

""Hypoallergenic"" products are popular for their perceived skin benefits.

But the definition of ""hypoallergenic"" is not standardized or regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration.

The term can mean whatever manufacturers want it to mean.

And research shows some ""hypoallergenic"" products actually contain allergens.

People with skin allergies probably trust that ""hypoallergenic"" products will be free of ingredients that cause itchy, painful reactions. So they might be surprised to learn that the term ""hypoallergenic"" is essentially meaningless.

You don't have to take our word for it — take the US Food and Drug Administration's.

""There are no federal standards or definitions that govern the use of the term 'hypoallergenic,'"" the FDA writes on its website. ""The term means whatever a particular company wants it to mean.""

And it might not mean much.

In a 2015 study, for example, scientists tested 135 children's skin-care products labeled ""hypoallergenic"" and found that almost 90% contained at least one known skin allergen.

In an April 1978 issue of its ""FDA Consumer"" magazine, the agency explained that it did try to regulate the term during the 1970s. The agency wanted to allow the use of ""hypoallergenic"" only if human studies showed a product caused a significantly lower rate of allergic reactions compared to other products. But cosmetic companies fought the FDA in court and won. To this day, ""hypoallergenic"" is still unregulated, and manufacturers don't have to offer the FDA any proof to back up the claim.

This doesn't mean that all companies who use the term are trying to deceive you. Some might voluntarily put their products through a barrage of high-quality allergy testing, but it's hard to know that when you're browsing store shelves in search of a new product. In the drugstore, when you see the term on two different products, it could mean two totally different things.

The bottom line: Don't assume that ""hypoallergenic"" products will never cause an allergic reaction. If you see a company using the marketing term, you might want to check their website or contact customer service and see if they have additional information on their interpretation of its meaning.

Find the area of the triangle.” ,http://www.iflscience.com/brain/microsoft-interview-question-crazily-difficult/,"If you're going for an interview at one of the world’s top tech companies, you need to know your stuff. Google’s now-banned interview questions have become the stuff of Internet folklore. But now, a former interviewee of Microsoft has revealed a question he was asked after applying for a job at the multi-billion dollar company. According to his story, their selection process is no more forgiving than Google's.

Prashant Bagdia posted on the website Quora the story of his friend who went for a job interview at Microsoft. For the last question, the interviewer asked: “A right triangle has a hypotenuse equal to 10 and an altitude to the hypotenuse equal to 6. Find the area of the triangle.”

Partly wondering why a software employer would be interested in a high school geometry question and partly wondering if this was a trick, the interviewee finally managed to piece together an answer he thought was correct, saying: “Sir, as area of any triangle is 0.5*base*height, the answer to this question would be 0.5 *10*6 which evaluates to 30!”

But his confident response was shut down by the interviewer. He was offered another chance to think about the question, but he stuck to his guns and was quickly told his answer was incorrect.

So why would they ask such a question? Well, rather deviously, a triangle with those measurements can’t exist.

As Prashant explains in his post , if the altitude is at a 45-degree angle and the hypotenuse is 10, then the largest the altitude can be is 5, as any higher altitude can’t exist in a right-angled triangle.

29,Altruism. ,http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/one-quality-in-men-might-be-even-more-attractive-than-good-looks-and-a-sense-of-humor/,"Most people would think that if it's not good looks that make a man most attractive to women, then it's definitely a sense of humor.

But studies consistently show that altruism is a top quality women are drawn to when they are looking for a relationship.

And a new study in the British Journal of Psychology found that altruistic men may have more sex, too.

The researchers asked unmarried Canadian adults how much they did good deeds like giving money to charity or helping someone get their car out of the snow. They then asked the participants how often they had sex and how many partners they've had.

Men who reported more altruistic acts had more sex — and more partners. For those who were in relationships, good-hearted men were more likely to have had more sex in the last 30 days, too.

In the second experiment of the study, the researchers had undergraduate students say whether they would like to donate money that they might receive for participating to charity. Those who said that they would also tended to have more casual sex, more sex in relationships, and more lifetime sex partners overall.

Another study, published in January 2016 in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, presented 202 women with different men to choose from. The different combinations of choices were either attractive or not, and they either did a good deed or didn't.

The women chose the selfish, attractive men for a one-night stand. But for a long-term relationship, they chose the altruistic man whether he was attractive or not.

A slightly older study, published in The Journal of Social Psychology in 2013, really drives this home. That study found that women valued altruism above other traits as a measure of whether a potential mate would make a good parent. The women also said that altruism was important for short-term relationships, but significantly more women said that the trait mattered for the long term.

Yet another study, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in July 2015, analyzed Germans' responses to a large annual survey.",2017-05-06 07:50:05
30,Planks. ,http://buff.ly/2pa07uj,"The INSIDER Summary:

Most people think sit-ups and crunches will give you a 6 pack.

Harvard doctors say that planks are far more effective.

Planks engage way more core muscles than crunches do.

If you think sit-ups are the quickest ticket to 6-pack abs, the physicians at Harvard Medical School have news for you: That classic exercise isn't as efficient as it seems.

Instead of crunches, they suggest doing planks, the exercise that involves holding yourself on your hands and toes in a pre-push-up position. The findings are detailed in a Harvard Medical School health report called ""Core Exercises.""

As opposed to sit-ups, which target only your abdominal muscles, planks recruit several groups of muscles along your sides, front, and back. If you want a strong core — especially the kind that would give you 6-pack-like definition across your abs — you need to challenge all of these muscles.

""Sit-ups or crunches strengthen just a few muscle groups,"" write the authors of the Harvard Healthbeat newsletter, which summarizes the report's key takeaways. ""Through dynamic patterns of movement, a good core workout helps strengthen the entire set of core muscles you use every day.""

Shutterstock

Conventional crunches may also be hard on different parts of your body, including your back, which gets pushed against the floor. Additionally, when you pull your body up into a sit-up position, you're working a group of muscles called the hip flexors which run from your thighs to the lumbar vertebrae in your lower back. When these muscles get too tight or become overly-strengthened, they can yank on your lower spine . This can cause pain or discomfort in your lower back.

And unlike ab-crunch machines, planks don't require a single piece of equipment, so you can do them anywhere.

Ready to give them a try?

The folks at Health.com recommend starting out by lying face-down with your legs extended and your elbows bent, directly under your shoulders, with your hands clasped. Your feet should be hip-width apart; your elbows should be shoulder-width apart. Next, tighten your abs and tuck your toes to elevate your body, keeping your forearms on the ground. Your body should be in a straight line from your head to your heels. To start, hold it for one minute.

As you get stronger, you can gradually build up to maintain the position for longer periods of time, and extend your arms to hold yourself up on your palms.

31,Contempt (a mix of anger and disgust). ,http://www.thisisinsider.com/behavior-thats-the-kiss-of-death-for-a-relationship-2016-1?utm_content=bufferdee4f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer,"The INSIDER Summary:

• Contempt is the most toxic behavior in a relationship.

• Researchers find it so powerful that they can use it — along with other negative behaviors — to predict divorce with 93% accuracy.





On the way home from work you have every intention of greeting your partner with a friendly ""Hi, how are you? How was your day?"" and listening attentively while he or she tells you all about it.

But the minute you open the door and drop your keys on the counter, you find yourself knee-deep in an argument about how he or she bought the wrong type of pepper.

Don't worry: It's perfectly normal to get into arguments like these with your significant other every once in a while, John Gottman, a psychologist at the University of Washington and founder of the Gottman Institute, told Business Insider.

It's what happens next that you need to watch out for, he says.

When you express your frustration over the pepper mix-up, do you listen while he explains that perhaps you didn't ever tell him what type of pepper you wanted? Do you think this over, and, when you realize that maybe he's right, do you apologize? Or do you adopt an attitude and think to yourself, ""What kind of an idiot doesn't know that bell peppers are for stir-fry and habaneros are for salsa?""

If you find yourself in the second situation, you're likely displaying contempt for your partner, and it could be putting your relationship in jeopardy.

Contempt, a virulent mix of anger and disgust, is far more toxic than simple frustration or negativity. It involves seeing your partner as beneath you, rather than as an equal.

Associated Press

Gottman and University of California at Berkeley psychologist Robert Levenson found this single behavior is so powerful that they can use it — along with the negative behaviors of criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling — to predict divorce with 93% accuracy

""Contempt,"" says Gottman, ""is the kiss of death.""

The striking 93% figure comes from a 14-year study of 79 couples living across the US Midwest (21 of whom divorced during the study period) published in 2002. Since then, decades of research into marriage and divorce have lent further support to the idea linking divorce with specific negative behaviors.

One recent study of 373 newlywed couples, for example, found that couples who yelled at each other, showed contempt for each other, or simply began to disengage from conflict within the first year of marriage were more likely to divorce, even as far as 16 years down the road.

Why are couples who exhibit this one behavior more likely to split up?

It comes down to a superiority complex.

Feeling smarter than, better than, or more sensitive than your significant other means you're not only less likely see his or her opinions as valid, but, more importantly, you're far less willing to try to put yourself in his or her shoes to try to see a situation from his or her perspective.

Picture a resonance chamber, suggests Gottman, with each person in the relationship a source of his or her own musical (or emotional) vibrations. If each partner is closed off to the other person's vibes (or emotions) and more interested in unleashing their own feelings of disgust and superiority, these negative vibrations will resound against one another, escalating a bad situation ""until something breaks,"" Gottman says.

If you've noticed yourself or your partner exhibiting this type of behavior, don't despair — it doesn't mean your relationship is doomed.

Being aware that you're doing something that could negatively affect your partner is the first step to actively combating it. If you can figure out how to avoid the behavior or replace it with a more positive one, you'll likely greatly improve the relationship — and increase your chances of staying together for longer.

Too much caffeine decreases the absorption of magnesium and B vitamins.

These deficiencies can result in a hormone imbalance.

You'll feel more energized by feeding your hormones properly than by guzzling caffeine.



Alisa Vitti is a functional nutritionist who runs a company called FLOLiving. She created an app called MyFLO to help women understand and naturally manage their periods. She's written a bestselling book called ""WomanCode."" She has a toddler at home. And she hasn't had a drop of caffeine in 20 years.

Vitti's philosophy for healthy living revolves around eating the right foods at the right times according to one's hormonal cycle and cutting out foods that set off hormonal dysfunction — like caffeine.

Coffee might give you a boost of energy now, but it slows you down in the long run. Caleb George/Unsplash

Hormone imbalance symptoms can include painful menstrual cramps, weight gain, trouble sleeping, constant fatigue, and mood swings. After Vitti was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) at the age of 20, she alleviated her symptoms naturally through changing her diet. Now, she wants to help others do the same.

According to Vitti, cutting out caffeine is a simple step that can make an enormous difference.

""Just nixing caffeine alone will stop you from depleting essential magnesium and B vitamin stores that are water soluble that caffeine forces you to flush out at higher concentration,"" she told INSIDER. ""Those two micronutrient deficiencies alone can kick off an entire hormonal imbalance and set you down the road of problems. If you just cut out the caffeine as one thing, you will feel dramatically better with your next cycle.""

Her FLOLiving program includes a caffeine step-down plan to wean addicts off of their daily fix.

""It should be a controlled substance, in my opinion,"" she said. ""It's very telling that there's a coffee shop on every corner — it's very addicting. Couple that with sugar and you're now stimulating two very powerful addiction centers in the body. It quickly runs people out of hormonal balance very easily.""

Instead of coffee, Vitti swears by other hot beverages like rooibos tea lattes that provide the same kind of ritual without the disruptive affects.

""You get more energized by feeding your hormones properly than you do by triaging your fatigue with caffeine,"" she said. ""The earlier you get off it, the better.""",2017-05-04 11:16:58

And so, when the time is right and they decide to start trying for a baby, they typically figure that they'll get pregnant right away.

But in reality, most couples don't conceive immediately after they start trying, according to Dr. Shruti Malik from Shady Grove Fertility in Virginia.

""Most couples will conceive in about six months or less,"" Malik told INSIDER. ""So it's interesting, because I have a lot of patients who spent a good portion of their adolescence trying to prevent pregnancy, and then later find out that it's more difficult than one would necessarily presume.""

The fertility expert explained that couples who have no history of infertility, and are having regular unprotected sex, have a 15% to 20% chance of conceiving per cycle.

""So if you were to consider all of those, if you have six cycles of doing that, most couples will conceive in that six-month window,"" Malik said.

However, if a couple has been having regular unprotected intercourse without getting pregnant for 12 months, it is recommended that they either seek a fertility consultation to get more information, or consider treatment for possible infertility.

""If she has not conceived in that window, there is a higher likelihood that there may be other factors that are contributing to that couple's difficulty in conceiving. And at that point in time, it warrants seeing a physician or fertility specialist,"" Malik explained.",2017-05-03 16:49:18

But at Yaya’s, a Thai restaurant in San Antonio, Texas, the owners have taken things one step further.

A Reddit user name Joshua_Glock first first posted Yaya’s Wi-Fi code this weekend, and since then, no one has successfully connected to the restaurant’s network. While businesses boasting clever Wi-Fi passcodes aren’t anything new (earlier this year, a Chinese restaurant made headlines after it made customers solve an equation to figure out its menu prices), the equation is proving impossible to solve, and subsequently driving Redditors to the brink of madness.

Over the course of the last four days, some 400 users have responded to Joshua_Glock’s plea for help. While many comments accused the restaurant of trolling its customers, some earnestly tried to either solve or find the flaw in the intricate equation.

“This looks a lot like a summation of a binomial probability density function. I strongly doubt the divider between N/m should even be there,” one user wrote. “Given the mistakes, it looks like something written by someone who doesn't understand what they're doing,” added another.

Sure, it’s possible that Yaya’s version Will Hunting made a simple mistake on the proverbial chalkboard. But what might be more probably is that a disgruntled employee got tired of being asked for the restaurant’s Wi-Fi password, Googled “impossible math equation,” and kicked back while waiting for the frenzy to ensue.

But as Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy explains in a recent Big Think video, the average person will probably find more success (and happiness) if they shoot for just down the block — at least at first.

The biggest mistake a lot of people make in setting goals for themselves, Cuddy says, is that they focus only on the outcome, not the process.

Cuddy is an expert on human behavior and the author of ""Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges."" She's conducted loads of research into tiny triggers that cause us to either take pride in our accomplishments or look back on our failings with regret and disappointment.

She's found that people often get down on themselves because of unrealistic or poorly planned goals.

""They're so big. They're so distant,"" Cuddy says of moonshots such as losing 40 pounds or getting a dream job. ""They require a million little steps in between, and each of those little steps is an opportunity to fail.""

The smarter approach is to learn to embrace the process.

On its face, that may seem counter-productive, like you're taking your eyes off the prize. But Cuddy emphasizes the power of using long-term thinking for short-term planning. You won't lose all the weight overnight, so your best option is to focus on making each day the best it can be. Chop up the big goal into a string of daily or weekly goals that are easier to accomplish.

""A lot of research is showing us that we do much better when we focus on incremental change, on little bits of improvement,"" Cuddy says.

That's how you go from a couch potato to a marathoner. You temporarily ignore the fact you need to run 26.2 miles several months from now, and focus only on running one mile today. And since that goal is much easier to achieve, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment once it's complete.

In turn, that creates the extra motivation you need to move onto a second and third run, and, ultimately, the race itself.

""Eventually, in aggregate, you get there,"" Cuddy says. ""You may not even realize it, until one day you turn around say 'Wow, this thing is much easier for me now than it was a year ago.'""",2017-05-02 17:35:31

37,60+ million years ago. ,https://www.seeker.com/a-chunk-of-india-and-eurasia-just-disappeared-2041404910.html,"Half of the mass of Eurasia and India is missing, new research finds, and may have been swallowed up by the Earth's mantle.

If so, that would be a surprise, as geoscientists thought that continental crust - the kind that makes up major landmasses - was too buoyant to dive down into the mantle, the pliable middle layer of the planet upon which the crust rides.

""It used to be thought that the mantle and the crust interacted only in a relatively minor way,"" study researcher David Rowley, a geoscientist at the University of Chicago, said in a statement. ""This work suggests that, at least in certain circumstances, that's not true."" [Photo Timeline: How the Earth Formed]

The mystery of the missing crust emerged as Rowley and his colleagues examined the slow-moving collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. These two rafts of continental crust have been bumping against each other for 60 million years, crumpling up to form the Himalayan mountains. The researchers combined multiple data sources to figure out the original size of the two continental plates before they started colliding.

RELATED: Forces That Created Himalayas Caused Afghan Quake

These new calculations, published online Sept. 19 in the journal Nature Geoscience, revealed a strange imbalance. Even after accounting for the ruched bits of crust that climbed upward to form the Himalayas, the excess that squeezed out the sides to form southeast Asia, and the crust that eroded over 60 million years and ended up in the oceans, Rowley and his colleagues couldn't explain where half of the original mass of India and Eurasia went. [Earth's 8 Biggest Mysteries]

That led to an unprecedented conclusion.

""If we've accounted for all possible solutions at the surface, it means the remaining mass must have been recycled wholesale into the mantle,"" said study researcher Miquela Ingalls, a graduate student in geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago.

Unknown interactions

Continental crust isn't supposed to be able to sink in that way. Geoscientists have long known that dense oceanic crust can be ""recycled"" into the mantle - this is the geologic process that happens at subduction zones like the one off the coast of California. Oceanic crust slides under less dense continental crust like a conveyer belt and, under pressure, becomes ductile and gooey, mixing in with the mantle.

But because continental crust is so buoyant, researchers thought it acted more like a pool raft: Push it down, and it will just pop back up again.

RELATED: Mt. Everest Shrank as Nepal Quake Lifted Kathmandu

The new research might cause researchers to re-evaluate that interaction and how it works. But the study also has the potential to explain some geochemical mysteries. For example, volcanic eruptions sometimes spew out elements like lead and uranium, which aren't very common in the mantle. These elements are pretty common in continental crust, however. If the India-Eurasia collision is representative, it might explain how these continental materials get recycled into the mantle and then erupt out again, Rowley said.

""The implication of our work is that, if we're seeing the India-Asia collision system as an ongoing process over Earth's history, there has been a continuous mixing of the continental crustal elements back into the mantle,"" he said.

A study has finally found the source of Antarctica's gruesome ""Blood Falls.""

It's been 106 years since Australian geologist Griffith Taylor discovered the vivid red falls flowing from the glacier named after him, onto the icy Lake Bonney.

It was originally thought to be caused by red algae, but it wasn't until 2003 that it was decided the red color came from oxidized iron and water most likely draining from a 5 million-year-old saltwater lake.

Now a study from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Colorado College confirms the glacier has not only a lake underneath it but also a water system that has been flowing for a million years.

The team used echolocation to track where the water flowed. The reason it has never frozen, they say, is a perpetual hydraulic system that sees the heat energy released by water freezing, in turn melting the surrounding ice.

39,No. ,http://www.inquisitr.com/3626660/is-peppa-pig-causing-autism-and-making-kids-lose-their-sense-of-empathy/,"Each Peppa Pig episode leaves kids laughing, but the charming pig is again under fire for being linked to autism and other long-term developmental issues. A new round of rumors have emerged that the well-loved show poses dangers to its young viewers.

The reports are based on a so-called 2012 research by epidemiologist Marc Wildemberg from Harvard University. Wildemberg claims that children who watch Peppa Pig for at least half an hour have 56 percent increased chances of having autism. While the alleged study already made headlines years ago, several media outlets have brought back the story.

Stories linking the British cartoon to developmental problems appear to be unfounded because according to some experts, searching for the epidemiologist on Google doesn't yield any credible information. It is possible that the reports were only fabricated in an attempt to discredit Peppa Pig.

It isn't the first time that Peppa Pig faced criticisms. In a previous interview with Courier Mail via Daily Mail, Dr. Karen Philip used Peppa Pig as an example of a cartoon that prevents kids from ""developing skills in empathy and reading other people's body language.""

She claims that children aged 4 to 5 get so used to watching the television that they fail to develop complete brain functions. Despite this, she reminds parents that the potentially harmful effects of television may be reversed if parents will allow their children to watch educational programs instead. Philip adds that something good can still come out from watching Peppa Pig.

""If parents interact with them during a show or if they want to watch, say Peppa Pig, and they're doing the singing and dancing and interacting, that's completely different.""

""Parents complain that their children copy Peppa's annoying behavior - behaving like a brat, burping and blowing raspberries all the time, and saying 'I don't want to play with you anymore' to their friends (just like Peppa does). That and they start jumping in muddy puddles all the time!""

Some believe that Peppa Pig contains sinister messages and portrays stereotypes. One example that parents cite is that Daddy Pig is the one who has an ""important job"" while Mommy Pig is the one who often goes around making tea. There are children who allegedly copy George's responses to food. When asked what they would love to have for breakfast, some kids would answer ""chocolate cake."" They would also say ""yuck"" when parents try to feed them vegetables.

On the other hand, Lifestyle One reports that many consider Peppa Pig to be educational. One mother, whose son has developmental delays, lauds the show.

""He now knows some things that we have never even mentioned to him, such as actions for Twinkle Twinkle Little Star… We have seen a massive improvement since he has been paying attention to the [show].""

Many insist that at the end of the day, it is the job of parents to limit their children's access to technology. There is no evidence yet that watching television indeed leads to autism, but studies advise that a child diagnosed as autistic must have limited access to the screen in order for him or her to have more meaningful pursuits. Cartoons, when carefully selected, can help children connect better with their peers.

40,"Tranexamic acid, a substance that helps blood clot more quickly. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/this-cheap-old-drug-can-save-thousands-of-new-mothers-from-bleeding-to-death,"A large international trial has showed that a cheap, readily available drug could save the lives of thousands of women each year who suffer from excessive bleeding after giving birth.

Even though childbirth is safer than ever, post-partum haemorrhage is still a major killer of new mums around the world, accounting for more than 100,000 deaths every year. But now the results are in on a drug that could help solve the problem.

A major study of 20,000 women in 21 countries has shown that a simple intravenous injection of tranexamic acid can prevent a third of the deaths caused by post-partum bleeding.

Tranexamic acid, which essentially helps blood clot more quickly, is not a new medicine. It was discovered by Japanese doctor Utako Okamoto back in the 1960s, when she was looking for something that could treat devastating bleeding after childbirth.

But at that time, she couldn't persuade any obstetricians to do a trial.

Now it is one of the medications available for women with heavy periods, and is used in different types of surgery to prevent excessive blood loss.

Large-scale trials have already shown that injections of tranexamic acid can prevent deaths from bleeding after accidents, and in 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) even added it to the list of essential medicines.

But until this latest trial, we still didn't have solid evidence on whether the drug would indeed be helpful for post-partum bleeding.

To test this hypothesis, in 2010 a research team led by scientists from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine embarked on a massive trial spanning six years and 21 countries on four continents.

Researchers randomly assigned women with clinically diagnosed post-birth bleeding to either receive a placebo or a tranexamic acid injection in addition to all the usual medical care their cases required.

The study was properly blinded - neither the patients nor the doctors administering the injection knew whether it contained the drug.

The researchers found that if tranexamic acid was injected within three hours after giving birth, it reduced deaths from post-birth bleeding by nearly one-third.

It also appears that it doesn't matter what the cause of the bleeding is, or even what type of birth the woman had - tranexamic acid is still effective, as long as it's given quickly.

These are some amazing results. If every woman who suffers life-threatening bleeding could receive this drug, it could save tens of thousands of lives every year.

Scientists are now looking at new ways to make the drug easy to administer. It's even possible that for women who are at higher risk, a tablet could be given before birth.

This is especially relevant in many African countries, where women often don't get timely treatment for pregnancy-related anemia.

""Half the women giving birth there start off with roughly half the red blood cells they should have,"" one of the researchers, Ian Roberts, told Donald G. McNeil at The New York Times.

""Doctors are forced to throw in everything they've got, because they know the woman can be dead in an hour.""

Currently, the WHO guidelines for the treatment of post-partum haemorrhage recommend injecting drugs that contract the uterus, such as oxytocin, in addition to massaging the uterus. The guidelines do mention tranexamic acid, but it's not a first-line treatment.

Now that we know its life-saving potential, those guidelines are ready for an update.

""Our results support the inclusion of tranexamic acid in WHO treatment guidelines for primary post-partum haemorrhage,"" the researchers write.

Tranexamic acid is available as a generic medication, and an injection can cost less than a dollar.

But researchers emphasise that in many low-income and middle-income countries, women die of post-partum bleeding at home, where nobody can quickly give them an intravenous injection.

Many of the patients in the trial whose deaths could not be prevented arrived at the hospital too late.

""We have to make sure tranexamic acid is available wherever a woman gives birth and is at risk,"" lead researcher Haleema Shakur told Sarah Boseley at The Guardian.

""We must make sure doctors and midwives are aware of the results of the study. And we need health ministers to make sure that the drug is available in their country and is on their shopping list of essential medicines.""

The trial was published in The Lancet.",2017-04-28 20:18:10

",http://www.popsci.com/can-you-really-get-blood-clot-and-die-from-hickey?con=TrueAnthem&dom=fb&src=SOC&utm_campaign&utm_content=585d361719d6ba00076cb2c7&utm_medium&utm_source,"A teenager in Mexico City recently died after going into convulsions over dinner with his family. Local media have reported that a hickey (or chupetón) the teen received from his girlfriend caused a blood clot that in turn led to his fatal stroke.

Should you be worried about getting a blood clot from your next love bite?

No. You really should not. It’s not impossible that a hickey could cause a blood clot that leads to a stroke, but it’s incredibly unlikely, according to Charles Abrams, president of the American Society of Hematology and a hematologist at the University of Pennsylvania. It could happen if a person’s blood vessels are torn during the chomp. “But I think that would be pretty hard to do,” he says.

Blood clots can form both in veins, which carry blood to your heart, and in arteries, which are more muscular and carry blood away from it. Clots are more likely to form when blood flow is sluggish, and can be related to a variety of different conditions.

If a clot forms or becomes lodged in an artery, it can cut off blood flow to the heart or part of the brain, causing a heart attack or a stroke. This is typically caused by atherosclerosis—in which plaques of fat and cholesterol build up in the arteries, making them harder and narrower—rather than an injury.

It’s more common for injuries to cause blood clots to form in a vein. “I’m very surprised that a hickey could actually do this,” Abrams says. “It has to be real trauma in order to cause an arterial clot, probably much more significant than the trauma that it takes to form a clot in a vein.”

This is not the only report of a love bite apparently causing a blood clot and stroke. In 2010, the New Zealand Medical Journal described the case of a 44-year-old woman who experienced weakness in her arm several days after getting a hickey. She recovered after being treated with blood thinners. The physicians who wrote up her report described the incident as “an uncommon mode of blunt trauma” to the neck and carotid artery.

Blood clots in veins don’t typically cause strokes, but they can lead to deep vein thrombosis, aka the reason you should stretch your legs during a long flight. Clots that form in the deep veins of your legs, arms or torso can become lodged in the lungs, a dangerous situation called pulmonary embolism.

The odds of dying from a hickey-induced blood clot are vanishingly small. But venous blood clots kill more people than breast cancer, car crashes, and AIDS combined each year. “I’m struck by this hickey-associated clot, but I’m more concerned about the more common and real risk of having a clot in a vein,” Abrams says.",2017-04-28 17:14:22

If processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. Surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate.

“We propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system,” write graduate student Erica Schulte and Dr. Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan in PLOS ONE.

The authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as “loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so.” They back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist.

“Although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating,” the authors write.

To test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the Yale Food Addiction Scale, of which Gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors.",2017-04-09 16:28:02
43,It bypasses their brains and accumulates in their eyes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/something-weird-happens-give-cocaine-fish/,"Sometimes, in the name of science, you have to give cocaine to a fish. But when you do, be prepared for something a little strange to happen.

Researchers in Switzerland have recently discovered that when zebrafish are given the white stuff, it bypasses their brains and accumulates in their eyes. Though this might not sound like a world-changing revelation, it could actually have a major impact on the way that new medicines are studied in the future.

Despite the fact that zebrafish don’t have much in common with people, they are at least vertebrates, and therefore have a central nervous system that scientists can play around with and test all sorts of experimental drugs on. As such, they are often used as aquatic guinea pigs, particularly when researchers want to observe the effects of psychoactive substances that they don’t feel comfortable using on humans.

However, reporting their findings in the journal Toxicological Sciences, the study authors provide clear evidence that some drugs – in this case cocaine – do not have the same effect on zebrafish as they do on mammals. Indeed, cocaine primarily acts on the brain when taken by those of us who live on dry land, yet heads straight to the eyes in zebrafish. This means that any data obtained using fish may not in fact be relevant to humans, thereby ruling out the possibility of using certain marine species to study drugs.

Cocaine affects neurotransmitters in the brain, resulting in hyperactivity. Roman Samborskyi/Shutterstock

To conduct their investigation, the team placed zebrafish larvae in tanks containing water contaminated with various amounts of cocaine, before using an imaging technique called Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry to observe where in their bodies the drug accumulated. Amazingly, they found that only a small amount ended up in the brain, although massive concentrations – sufficient to kill a person – built up in the eyes.

Though the researchers aren’t entirely sure why this is the case, they speculate that cocaine may have a chemical affinity for melanin, which is found in the eyes.

In contrast, when people take cocaine it acts on the brain, triggering the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, resulting in hyperactivity. Yet the drug has the exact opposite effect on zebrafish, causing them to become less active. The study authors suggest this is because it acts like an anaesthetic when it comes into contact with the skin, gills, and peripheral nervous system.

Study co-author Kristin Schirmer explained in a statement that “if we want to have a better knowledge of the effects of such chemicals on the ecosystem, we need a more detailed understanding of the processes of uptake through water – they’re quite different from when drugs are inhaled or injected.”",2017-04-08 23:17:08
44,Cancer. ,http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/health/cancer-mayo-survey-most-important-health-challenge/index.html,"Story highlights A new survey reveals what health care challenge concerns Americans the most Cancer surpasses obesity, Alzheimer's and infectious diseases as ""most important""

CNN —

What health condition concerns Americans the most? Cancer – more so than obesity, neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and even infectious diseases, such as Zika, Ebola and HIV/AIDS.

That’s just one of many findings about Americans’ opinions on health that emerged in the latest Mayo Clinic National Health Checkup survey results, released Tuesday.

The idea behind the survey was to simply “listen to our patients,” said Dr. John Wald, medical director for public affairs at the Mayo Clinic, who helped conduct the survey.

“This survey allows us to extend this same principle beyond the walls of our campuses to assess the current state of the American health consumer and to begin to define gaps and opportunities to better interact and educate these same consumers,” he said. “It is only through effective listening that you begin to define the best solutions.”

The survey was conducted July 28 through 31 and involved 1,008 adults nationwide.

The participants were asked questions via telephone about which health conditions they believed to be the “most important” health challenge in the country, how much progress modern medicine was making in treating those conditions, and which health care concerns would weigh into their decision for voting for a specific presidential candidate, among others.

The results revealed that a majority of the respondents – 37% – believed cancer to be the No. 1 most significant health care challenge in the country, followed by obesity as No. 2, neurological diseases as three, diabetes as four and heart disease as five. Infectious diseases were thought to be the least significant.

“Interestingly, only 3% viewed the Zika virus as a significant health care challenge,” Wald said.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but cancer comes in as a close second. About 84% of respondents said they would be interested in a vaccine to prevent cancer, if one existed.

More people living in the West (21%) than in the South (13%), Northeast (10%) or Midwest (8%) said they would not be interested in a cancer vaccine.

Most respondents – 38% – considered brain cancer to be the “scariest” type. About 20% of respondents said pancreatic was the most concerning type, 10% said lung, 8% said breast, 7% said prostate, 5% said colon, and 5% said skin.

“Cancer has always been a scary disease in American life, especially in the years when there was little one could do about it,” said Dr. Howard Markel, director of the University of Michigan Medical School’s Center for the History of Medicine, who was not involved in the new survey.

“Early in the 20th century well into the 1970s, people called it the ‘C-word’ and did not want to discuss it publicly. That has been changing in the past few decades, thanks to the host of wonderful advances in modern medicine, but serious cancer remains, well, serious. So I am not surprised,” he said of the survey results.

However, while respondents pointed to cancer as the most important health care challenge, 74% said that they believed some progress was being made to address it.

Most of the respondents – 83% – said some progress was being made in developing new treatments for heart disease, and fewer – 52% – said progress was being made with obesity.

Respondents also weighed in on their personal health in the survey. About 86% said they get headaches; 63% said their headaches are triggered by stress, 54% said by not eating and 41% said by not getting enough sleep.

About 72% of respondents defined a good night’s sleep as snoozing seven to eight hours, but nearly half – 49% – said they achieve that much shut-eye half the time or less, on average.

With the 2016 presidential election approaching in November, 95% of respondents said health care issues would weigh into their decision in voting for a specific candidate.

What influences their choice of a presidential candidate? About 79% said lowering health care costs, 78% said improving the quality of health care, 72% said improving access to health care, and 63% said increasing funding for medical research.

Although a survey of some 1,000 adults may not be representative of all Americans, asking questions about what concerns the country is important, said Philip Alcabes, professor of community health at Hunter College of the City University of New York, who was not involved in the new survey.

“Ideally, our health policy is based on both the evidence about what real threats to Americans’ health exist and also what Americans are truly most worried about. … So, it makes perfect sense to ask these questions,” Alcabes said.

“What’s interesting but not surprising about the Mayo Clinic survey is the intensity of concern about the delivery of health care services. The cost, quality of care, access to care,” he said. “I don’t know how representative this is, but those are concerns that we hear in so many forums and from so many sectors of society, so it’s not surprising that that’s what emerges from this survey also.”",2016-09-27 00:18:54
45,No. ,http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/doctor-are-we-over-vaccinating-small-children,"I’m not someone who writes about vaccinations. In fact, if I’m at a social event and two people begin to discuss argue about vaccinations, I quickly recall that I forgot something somewhere and excuse myself.

That said, one of my physician-friends recently shared an article from the Scientific Parent that touched on vaccinations.

In the piece, Dr. Alison Shuman, a California-based pediatrician, asks whether or not small children are being vaccinated “too much, too soon.” Shuman, Chair of Pediatrics at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, says that contrary to popular belief, children are actually being exposed to far fewer foreign agents than their parents and grandparents had as children.

We have refined and improved our vaccines so much that our children today are even safer than we were. So when you worry about exposing your children to so many “more” things, don’t worry, you aren’t! You are exposing them to fewer antigens than all of us got. If you are wondering how many antigens are in certain vaccines, the hepatitis B, diphtheria and tetanus vaccines each contain just one antigen.

Essentially, children are receiving more vaccinations but far fewer antigens in those vaccinations. Here's what she says:

When we were children (70s, 80s and early 90s) we were vaccinated against fewer things (which were nonetheless still deadly). Let’s take the CDC’s vaccine schedule from 1983 for example. There were seven diseases we were protected against including measles, mumps, rubella, (MMR), Diptheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) and polio. Because of how vaccines were made at the time, we were exposed to about 3,000 antigens by the time we were 12 months old and 12,000 by the time we were 4 if we got all of our vaccines.

Antigens are basically any foreign material designed to trigger or stimulate your immune system. In vaccinations, these “foreign invaders” are weakened so human immune systems can easily overcome them and learn how to defend itself from whatever virus or bacteria one is being immunized for.

According to Shuman and the below chart provided by Scientific Parent, advances in the field of medicine have allowed medical professionals to combat twice as many diseases with just a fraction of the antigens.

Will this end the debates on vaccinations? Of course not. Nor should it. Putting foreign agents into our children is serious stuff, and open, inquiring minds can help us better understand what we’re putting into their bodies and why we’re doing it.

I know many people out there are passionate about this issue and know much more about it than I do. So I ask: Did Shuman miss anything or get something wrong? Did she change your mind?

If, dear reader, you are now adorned with a doubt-infused frown, then you’ve probably clocked that this won’t be due to some apocalyptic shift in plate tectonics. Continental drift, however, does have a role to play in this geographic kerfuffle.

The Australian Plate is moving about 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) northwards every single year. This motion has accumulated over the decades to produce a significant discrepancy between local coordinates on maps and global coordinates in digital navigation systems used by satellites.

At present, this difference amounts to an error of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet). This is enough to cause a problem to anything in Australia that uses GPS-like systems, including smartphones and vehicles.

""If you want to start using driverless cars, accurate map information is fundamental,"" Dan Jaksa, a member of Geoscience Australia, told BBC News. “We have tractors in Australia starting to go around farms without a driver, and if the information about the farm doesn't line up with the coordinates coming out of the navigation system there will be problems.”

In order to stave off a grim future where autonomous tractors plough into helpless farm animals by mistake, the nation’s local coordinates will jump northwards at the start of next year. By 2020, the inexorable march of plate tectonics will catch up to the adjustment, and both the analogue and digital coordinate sets will match up for the first time since 1994, when the local coordinate system was last updated.

So as to stop this silliness happening again, a new as-of-yet unspecified system will be implemented in 2020 that will keep the two sets of coordinates matched in real-time. “Once we have a system that can deal with changes over time, then everybody in the world could be on that same system,” Jaksa added.

Australia was attached to Antarctica until around 85 million years ago, whereupon they began to initially rift apart. By 45 million years ago, 21 million years after the non-avian dinosaurs bit the dust, they had completely separated from each other. Although the Australian Plate initially fused with the Indian Plate, they have since become segregated, perhaps as little as 3 million years ago.

In 50 million years’ time, Australia will collide into the southeastern coast of China, eventually forming a brand new mountain range. It will be one of the earliest jigsaw pieces that will culminate in the formation of Pangaea Ultima, the next true supercontinent, 250 million years from now. By then, it’s likely that our coordinate technology would have moved on quite a bit.",2016-08-01 23:15:07

Remember correlation does not equal causation. ,http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/why-watching-too-much-porn-could-be-bad-for-the-brain-9458357.html,"Men who watch regularly pornography could be reducing the size of their brain, a study has found.

Researchers discovered less grey matter in the brains of men who regularly view pornography compared with those who don’t.

Experts say it’s the first evidence for a link between watching sexually explicit material and reductions in brain size – but the new study doesn’t prove that pornography causes changes to the brain.

They say an alternative explanation could be that men with a certain type of brain with overly-sensitive reward stimuli – known as the ‘striatum’ - could be more likely to use pornography.

Dr Simone Kühn from the Max Planck Institution in Berlin led the study. “Unfortunately we cannot answer this question based on the results of the present,” she said.

“It’s not clear, for example, whether watching porn leads to brain changes or whether people born with certain brain types watch more porn”.

Dr Kühn and colleagues from Berlin’s Charite University used 64 healthy men between the ages of 21 and 45 years and studied their porn-watching habits.

They matched their survey results with scans of the men’s brains and observed both the volume of the brain and the way they reacted to sexually explicit images.

The findings, published in the JAMA Psychiatry Journal, have been met with scepticism from some experts who say that watching pornography in moderation was probably not harmful.

Dr Gregory Tau from Columbia University said that porn-watching was “probably not terrible in moderation”.

“It is possible that there are individuals with a certain kind of brain that are more susceptible to these kinds of behaviours,” he said.

“Or, it’s possible it’s the excessive use (of porn) that’s perpetuating itself to causing brain changes. Or, it could be both.”

Dr Kühn has called for future studies to conduct deeper investigations into the effects of pornography on the brain over time.",2016-07-14 09:30:00

Hm.",http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-are-nipples-darker-than-the-rest-of-the-skin-a6808631.html,"Perhaps it’s not be up there with life’s most important questions – what is the meaning of it all, why are we here? – but don’t pretend you haven’t ever wondered why some parts of your body are different colours.

Why, for example, are our nipples and genitals different colours to the rest of us? And does this serve any purpose?

The answers appears to be no, a dermatologist recently explained.

Dr Lindsey Bordone, a dermatologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York told the Mail Online that the change is down to a combination of two things: melanin and hormones.

When a human hits puberty, the spike in oestrogen and testosterone caused the body to create melanin – the amino acid which also gives the colour to our hair.

This makes the penis, nipples, areolas, and labia turn darker a darker colour.

The phenomenon is also why children who have blonde hair become brunettes as they grow older.

A woman’s skin can also become darker during pregnancy for similar reason, particularly around the areolas. Moles and freckles often become a more intense shade, while fewer women will experience chloasma which affects the forehead, cheeks and neck.

But Dr Bordone warned that darker skin is also a symptom of diabetes.

This condition is known as acanthosis nigricans, according to the American Diabetes Association, and sees a person developing darker areas on the sides of the neck, armpits and groin.

50,Nope. ,http://thescienceexplorer.com/brain-and-body/explainer-there-any-science-behind-astrology,"Photo credit: pixabay.com

Looking at the star signs from a scientific standpoint.

A hospital in Argentina is reportedly using astrology to help treat some mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety, by giving patients an understanding of their astrological personalities. The guidance is given based on the patient’s sign — whether he or she is an Aries, Taurus, or so forth — and the leading astrologist develops a star chart for each patient.

Unsurprisingly, the astrology workshop is being met with criticism over its scientific validity.

Diego Andrés Golombek, a professor at the University of Quilmes in Argentina, told Quartz, “Astrology can be harmless, of course, unless it gives directions and instructions into how to proceed with, for example, an illness or medical treatment.”

SEE ALSO: 6 Questions to Ask Before Sharing Science on the Internet

“And, indeed, having such a program organized by a hospital leads into the completely false assumption that astrology might have some kind of scientific background which, of course, it completely lacks. I am horrified by this prospect!”

So, based on the evidence (or lack thereof), is there any real science to support astrology?

There are a few foundational ways to evaluate whether a concept is scientific, and the University of California, Berkeley’s Understanding Science website lays out a “Science checklist.”

1. Does astrology use testable ideas?

For something to have a true scientific basis, it has to encompass testable ideas. However, as Understanding Science explains, “Some expectations generated by astrology are so general that any outcome could be interpreted as fitting the expectations; if treated this way, astrology is not testable.”

2. Does it rely on evidence?

There haven’t been many studies that investigate the science behind astrology, but of the few that have, the results have failed to support the validity of astrological views. For instance, a study tested the accuracy of astrological charts in describing the personality traits of 193 study participants, and the results indicated that the scores were at a level consistent with chance.

So far, it can’t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence — and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself as valid.

3. Does it attempt to explain the natural world?

Yes, astrology’s basic premise is that the sun, moon, planets, and constellations have an effect on humans and earthly events. Further, it uses a set of rules about the relative positions and movements of the stars and planets to predict and explain worldly events and human personality.

However, as Understanding Science explains, “Although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid — and this is a key part of science.”

Plus, astrology doesn’t lead to ongoing research, which is another key part of science.

So, unfortunately for everyone who swears their daily horoscope is always on point or blames their stubbornness on being a Scorpio or a Taurus, it appears that there’s not much scientific evidence to back those claims. Until then, astrology will have to remain in the realm of pseudoscience.

51,Cat litter. ,http://www.iflscience.com/technology/theres-a-rather-unusual-way-to-fix-your-phone-if-youve-dunked-it-in-water/,"Dropping your phone into a fluid-carrying vessel, whether that be a swimming pool, a pond, or a (hopefully otherwise empty) toilet, is a profoundly irritating event, and one that many phones tend not to return intact from. There are normally two options at this point: sticking your phone in some rice, which can suck out the water, or swearing profusely and sulking.

According to phone company Gazelle, there is a third option, so long as you own a cat or kitten. No, despite their smarts, your feline companions themselves won’t be able to help you – in fact, they probably don’t care about your technological predicament. As it turns out, a specific type of cat litter is more effective at saving your phone from a watery death than rice.

In a post entitled “The Truth About Rice, the Galaxy and Everything,” which definitely oversells itself, Gazelle explains how its dedicated team of phone revivers purposefully drowned nine unfortunate smartphones before attempting to resurrect each one via different methods, including rice, instant oatmeal, pearly couscous, regular cat litter, and crystal kitty litter – the last of which is silica gel, the dehydrating agent found in little packets inside many electronics packages.

The company recommends that you shake as much of the water out of your phone first, allowing it to briefly air dry, then place it in a bag of crystal cat litter for as long as possible. They suggest that it takes several days for this to work, so the wait promises to be nail-biting.

If, however, your phone still isn’t operational 48 to 72 hours after the clumsiness occurred, then you may want to buy yourself a new phone.

53,"The sun is in a state of solar minimum where the amount of activity drops dramatically-- can even be devoid of features. On the other hand, when we can see sunspots, it's undergoing a solar maximum. This whole changing from maximum to minimum lasts for 11 years. ",http://www.iflscience.com/space/why-is-the-sun-blank/,"A new image of the Sun shows a rather strange occurrence – there are no visible features on the surface, indicating very little activity. Rather than signaling the end of times, though, this highlights a regular process taking place on our Solar System’s star.

The Sun goes through cycles of activity lasting 11 years, moving from a solar maximum to a solar minimum. During a maximum, the Sun is at its most active, with sunspots – dark areas of magnetic activity – occurring frequently across the surface, several hundred per year. Often, these can be accompanied by bursts of material called coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The exact cause of solar cycles is not fully understood.

During a solar minimum, the amount of activity drops dramatically. And, in some instances, the Sun can be devoid of any noticeable features at all. That’s the case in this latest image, taken on June 4 by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). As highlighted by meteorologist Paul Dorian at Vencore Weather, this was part of a quiet spell that lasted for about four days. This suggests we are heading towards the next solar minimum, predicted to take place around 2020.

“The blank sun is a sign that the next solar minimum is approaching and there will be an increasing number of spotless days over the next few years,” writes Dorian. “At first, the blankness will stretch for just a few days at a time, then it’ll continue for weeks at a time, and finally it should last for months at a time when the sunspot cycle reaches its nadir.”

Here's what the Sun looks like with sunspots on the surface, taken from July 24 to August 1, 2012. NASA/SDO/HMI

This cycle is called Solar Cycle 24, being the 24th observed since sunspot activity was first recorded in 1755. Dorian also said this is the weakest cycle in more than a century, since Solar Cycle 14 in 1906.

In this 24th cycle, solar maximum was reached in April 2014, and the next maximum is not expected until the 2020s. Despite some claims to the contrary, though, this solar minimum is very natural – and it’s not about to cause a “mini ice age”. Perhaps the most noticeable change during a solar minimum is an increase in cosmic rays making their way to Earth.

During high activity, the Sun usually protects Earth from cosmic rays – originating from things like supernovas – thanks to its solar storms. But during lesser activity, cosmic rays can more easily enter the Solar System, and could pose a threat to the health of astronauts.

At any rate, we’ve survived solar cycles before, and this one will be no different. Still, this latest picture is pretty interesting to look at.

54,They're not. It's the unexpectedness of finding an unusual object beside them that they find frightening. ,http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/cats-are-completely-terrified-cucumbers-why/,"Cats are deeply curious creatures. Recent evidence suggests that these tiny lions see us as inessential landlords, or rubbish, fur-lacking kittens. A new internet craze involving our feline companions has unveiled another piece of strange information: For some utterly bizarre reason, they appear to be terrified – utterly terrified – of cucumbers.

In the vast majority of the videos, cat owners are seen sneaking up behind their pets as they’re facing the other way – mostly eating – and placing the green, elongated vegetable behind them. As the cat turns around and spots the unexpected item, it loses its mind, leaps into the air, and gets away from it as fast as it can. In some videos, the cats then engage in a stare down with the cucumber, waiting in vain for it to make its first move.

But the question remains: Why on Earth are cats frightened by these innocuous vegetables?

To be fair, there aren’t any videos of cats seeing a cucumber from a distance and then walking up to interrogate it, so perhaps it’s the unexpected sight of a cucumber behind them that’s frightening, not the cucumber itself: An unexpected pineapple would likely be just as jarring. As it turns out, Dr. Roger Mugford, a specialist in animal behavior, told the Telegraph: “I think that the reaction is due to the novelty and unexpectedness of finding an unusual object secretly placed whilst their heads were down in the food bowl.”

Cats are shown to be suspicious of anything that moves rapidly, makes a lot of noise, or lights up erratically: essentially, anything that they don’t fully understand, which isn’t really that different from most animals, including humans. It’s also worth noting that cats are mostly solitary animals, and humans are as sociable as animals can be – so they’re baffled enough by us as it is. Freaking them out with unexpected cucumbers probably isn’t helping.

“Cats have to be suspicious of the unknown: It could represent the danger of a snake or another predator,” Mugford continued. “I suspect that there would be the same reaction to a model spider, a plastic fish or a human face mask.”

Well, there’s only one way to find out. This is, after all, for science. Get your model spiders at the ready.",2016-07-04 08:46:18

",http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/why-does-eating-pineapple-make-your-mouth-sore/,"Pineapples are thought to have originated in South America and were first discovered by Europeans in 1492 on the island of Guadeloupe. However, pineapples didn't make it to England until the late 1600's, where it quickly became a must-have item for the wealthy. Worth around $8,000 (£5000) each, only the absolute elite could afford this exotic fruit, and according to one source, the fruit wasn't even eaten – just carried around under one's arm at parties and social events as a status symbol.

If you've ever eaten a pineapple, you'll have experienced that weird, scratchy, rough feeling on your tongue after you've munched through a few chunks. So why does that happen?

It turns out that pineapple contains bromelain, a mixture of enzymes that digest proteins. Despite bromelain being an approved anti-inflammatory treatment and having other health benefits, when it comes into contact with the sensitive skin in and around one's mouth, it's actually breaking down proteins, causing the tissue to become sore and inflamed.

56,"Give it some head. A layer of small bubbles insulates the beer from air exposure (which degrades the taste over time) and leads to a ""creamy mouthfeel — like a draft."".",http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/a-cure-for-cheap-beer/62256,"Open the fridge, grab a frosty one, pop off the cap and enjoy. That’s the ritual performed countless times a day by us beer drinkers. And we’re all doing it wrong.

At least, that’s what Philip Petracca, co-founder of New Hampshire-based Fizzics, believes. His company’s mission is to give every one of us the “perfect pour.” How? With a home beer tap machine that uses science to improve the drinking experience, regardless of the brand. The secret to making any beer taste better is in getting a better head, Petracca claims. Beer in cans, bottles or barrels contains a lot of dissolved CO2 under pressure, he says, and when improperly handled it can cause bubbles and foam to overflow or improperly foam.

So, if the bubbles are too big — a common result of a hand-pour — our mouths perceive a “grainy” feel, which can lead many a beer drinker to avoid pouring heads altogether. But that’s a mistake, according to Petracca. Not only does the head insulate the rest of the beer from flavor-robbing oxygen (even a few minutes of air exposure can degrade the taste), but it can also help seal in the gases that give beer its effervescence, something that likewise maximizes flavor.

… produces a head with small, perfectly formed bubbles, which delivers a creamy mouthfeel — like a draft.

The Fizzics machine, which is about the size of a small kitchen appliance, produces a head with small, perfectly formed bubbles, which delivers a creamy mouthfeel — like a draft. Here’s how it works. Place a bottle, can or growler (a reusable container for transporting draft beer) — the Fizzics machine doesn’t care — inside its sealed chamber. Pull forward on the silver tap handle to pressurize the chamber, which forces the beer out of its original container and into your glass via a small plastic tube. The magic happens toward the end of the pour, when you push the tap handle backward. This action kick-starts the patented agitation process, which turns the remaining drops of liquid into an ultra-smooth head, using sound waves. There are no gas cylinders or other consumables needed — just four AA batteries.

Steve Abrams, co-founder of Canada’s Mill Street Brewery, agrees a good beer head improves the taste of a brew considerably, noting that in Europe, bartenders will often take extra time to “layer” your beer as it’s poured. Though he hasn’t tried the Fizzics, Abrams has encountered “lots of beer gadgets,” even one that lets you pour a beer with your mind. He says the Fizzics could indeed improve a beer’s taste, as long as it’s served cold. But some might find the selling price of $150 (they start shipping in October) a bit steep. Petracca defends the cost, pointing out that when compared to a night at a bar, “it’s not expensive at all, if experiences and social connections are important.”

Perhaps it’s a nice idea for a gift, but Abrams points out that “pouring beer into a glass is not rocket science,” and offers up this video for those who need a quick 101 on the technique. Rocket science or not, the Fizzics would certainly make a good conversation piece. To that, we say, “Cheers!”",2016-06-28 16:25:02
57,"They tend to live longer. However, it's not necessarily the act of having a child later in life that causes longevity, but that the bodies of women who can support healthy pregnancies later in life tend to age slower. ",http://www.ozy.com/acumen/late-kids-long-life/32804?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=US,"Because if you are able to have kids later in life, you might be wired to live longer, too.

Attention, 30-something single ladies: If you’re tired of people dropping not-so-subtle hints about having kids while you still have the eggs and energy, you can (probably, politely) tell them to back off.

A Boston University School of Medicine study found that women who can still give birth naturally after age 33 have a higher chance of living to extreme old age than those who had their last child before age 30. But the report, published in the online version of the journal Menopause in April 2014 doesn’t imply that putting off pregnancy will add years to your life. “If you physically delay having children, that’s not going to help with longevity, Paola Sebastiani, a Boston University biostatistics professor and study co-author, told OZY. A woman with a natural ability to have children later in life suggests that her body – including her reproductive system – just happens to age at a slow pace. Some women’s biological clocks simply tick more slowly than most.

Women who had their last child after 33 were twice as likely to live to 95 or older, compared with those who had their last child by 29.

Sebastiani and her colleagues analyzed data from the Long Life Family Study, a survey of 551 families, many of whose members lived to a ripe old age. They determined the ages at which 462 women had their last child and how long they ended up living. Turns out women who gave birth to their last child after 33 were twice as likely to live to 95 years or older, compared with those who had their last child by age 29.

The researchers suspect that the former group’s DNA might harbor genetic variants that slow aging and lower the risk for age-related diseases that can hamper fertility (like ovarian cancer or diabetes). Women with such variants could presumably bear children for a longer period of time, boosting their chances of passing these genes down to future generations — meaning we may have women to thank for the evolution of longevity genes. It could also explain why of the people who live to be 100 or older, 85% are women, compared to only 15% of men.

Earlier studies have unearthed similar insights. Take the ongoing New England Centenarian Study, which found that women who had children after 40 were a whopping four times more likely to live to 100 than women who had their last child at a younger age.

Given the possible link between longevity and a longer fertility window, Sebastiani’s findings also suggest that researchers should further investigate the genetic influences of reproductive fitness, since they might also affect aging rates and vulnerability to age-related diseases. Sebastiani and her team have been working to identify the genetic variants that make some women age slower and plan to publish their results at the end of this year. Understanding the pathways they govern could help scientists develop drugs that produce the same effect.

So even if your biological clock is ticking, it might still be a while before its alarm goes off — depending on your genes.",2016-06-28 12:11:52

59,"They were at a motivational seminar led by Tony Robbins (not the first time this has happened at his seminars) yet only 40 of 7000 participants were burned, likely because they were stopping on the coals to take videos and selfies. ",https://gizmodo.com/40-people-got-burned-firewalking-in-texas-for-the-dumbe-1782559421,"Around 40 people attending a seminar with motivational speaker Tony Robbins in downtown Dallas yesterday were injured when a group exercise involving walking across hot coals went wrong. And it’s not the first time this has happened: back in 2012, for instance, 21 people in San Jose were burned after attempting the stunt at another Robbins seminar.

People got burned walking across hot coals, you say? There’s a shocker. But the Dallas seminar had over 7000 participants, most of whom completed the fire walking ceremony without injury. Why did most of those people walk across the coals safely while a (relative) handful got burned?

The Robbins camp might say they just didn’t believe in themselves enough to fully unleash the power within, but it actually has everything to do with physics. As I wrote back in 2012, it is quite possible to firewalk safely. A physics professor at the University of Pittsburgh named David Willey does it all the time, thanks to his grasp of the underlying physics.

This is well-established science. The key factors at play are the low thermal conductivity of the burning wood-turned-to-coal, an insulating layer of ash, and the short time of contact between the hot coals and the soles of the feet.

In particular, the coals must burn down to around 1000 degrees Fahrenheit, preferably with a thin layer of ash providing extra insulation. This also burns off excess water, which increases the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the coals.

And while it’s tempting to want to run across hot coals, this actually pushes your feet deeper into the embers, increasing the burn risk. A nice steady walking pace is best. (Some say wetting your feet beforehand can add protection via the Leidenfrost effect, but Willey has found the effects of this to be negligible and prefers to firewalk dry-footed.)

Back in 1998, Willey and Kjetil Kjernsmo of University of Oslo developed a computer model of a fire walker’s foot, and then compared it to infrared imagery of people fire walking in Seattle. Those images showed that the foot really does remain cool when the stunt is done correctly.

“[T]here was someone in front of us and someone behind us on their cell phone, taking selfies and taking pictures.”

So what went wrong in Dallas? Probably the same thing that happened at the 2012 San Jose seminar. You have to set up a scientific experiment correctly to get the best results, and for something like fire walking there’s not much margin for error. Those who got burned probably lingered just a bit too long on the hot coals, the better to, say, snap a selfie of their moment of enlightenment.

That seems to be borne out by witness statements. “From my observation, there was someone in front of us and someone behind us on their cell phone, taking selfies and taking pictures,” Jacqueline Luxemberg, a participant who did the firewalk and emerged unscathed, told WFAA. “[She asked others] to video record for her, so I think that that has a lot to do with it.”

So should you ever decide to attempt a fire walking stunt yourself, remember: walk (don’t run), make sure the coals have burned down sufficiently, don’t wet your feet beforehand, and try not to strike too long a pose for that selfie. Oh, and have some ice and Vicodin handy, just in case.

Rest assured, it’s neither—just a perfectly natural, snow-dwelling algae. So, why are scientists all in a tizzy about it? Because it’s causing glaciers to melt faster.

That’s the startling conclusion of a study just published in Nature Communications that which suggests we may have seriously underestimated the ability of tiny red algae to screw with Earth’s ice caps. And their so-called “bio-albedo” feedback is only expected to grow as the planet warms up.

Red snow algae have been described all over the world in polar and alpine settings from Greenland and Antarctica to Iceland and the European Alps. In the winter, they lie dormant in the snow as spores. But in the late spring and summer, when their icy habitat begins to melt, they blossom to produce striking pink landscapes.

Now, a sweeping analysis of red snow algae across 21 glaciers in the pan-European Arctic shows that these tiny critters are actually helping the snow melt faster.

The reason has to do with a simple climate-altering process known as the albedo effect. You’ve probably heard about how glaciers keep our planet cool by reflecting sunlight. As glaciers melt, they give way to darker land or ocean surfaces—surfaces with a lower albedo. This causes the Earth to absorb more sunlight and heat up even more.

Turns out, red snow algae have a non-trivial effect on the albedo of the snowy surfaces they colonize, reducing it by as much as 13 percent, according to the new study. And while it’s still unclear just how large these blooms can get, lead study author Steffi Lutz of the University of Leeds says they can be quite widespread in the Arctic by summertime.

“Based on personal observations, a conservative estimate would be 50 percent of the snow surface on a glacier at the end of a melt season,” she told Gizmodo in an email. “But this can potentially be even higher.”



This makes red snow algae an unaccounted mechanism in the long list of reasons the Arctic is melting like a popsicle in a microwave. Lutz and her colleagues are now working to estimate how much glacial melt red snow algae are actually responsible for. They’re also hoping to incorporate the colorful critters into future global climate models.

What’s worrisome is that even if red snow algae have a small influence on Arctic ice cover today, their role is likely to grow as human carbon emissions warm the planet.

“The algae need liquid water in order to bloom,” Lutz said. “Therefore the melting of snow and ice surfaces controls the abundance of the algae. The more melting, the more algae. With temperatures rising globally, the snow algae phenomenon will likely also increase leading to an even higher bio-albedo effect.”

It’s yet another reminder that microbes are pulling the strings around here much more than we humans tend to appreciate. And that even as Miami drowns, some creatures will thrive in the hotter future.

61,Working over 60 hours per week plus doing chores at home may lead to eventual health issues like heart disease. ,http://hellogiggles.com/we-finally-have-a-scientifically-backed-reason-to-not-clean-our-homes/,"Having a clean home is one of life’s little joys, right? But by the time Sunday rolls around you’re probably like us and think, “I HATE CLEANING!”

While there are plenty of excuses you can come up with to NOT clean your home, deep-down you probably know most of those are not very good reasons.

Here’s where science can help!

Allard Dembe, professor of health services mangement and policy at Ohio State University’s College of Public Health, looked at women from the working generation of the ’70s to ’80s. This was a time when more and more women were having careers, but also still dealing with daily chores back home.

Dembe told The Huffington Post, “My speculation is that women have to play a lot of multiple roles.” He continued, “It’s less surprising that women who are then into their 50s and 60s are really bearing the disease repercussions of what’s happened during those early years of really working their butts off.”

Well, you may be right, according to a new study.

Cats, dogs, and other mammals are thought to see in ultraviolet light, which opens up a whole different world than the one we see, the study explains.

Seeing the World in Ultraviolet (UV) Light

UV light is the wave length beyond the visible light from red to violet that humans can see. Humans have a lens that blocks UV from reaching the retina. It was previously thought that most mammals have lenses similar to humans.

Scientists studied the lenses of dead mammals, including cats, dogs, monkeys, pandas, hedgehogs, and ferrets. By researching how much light passes through the lens to reach the retina, they concluded that some mammals previously thought not to be able to see UV actually can.

""Nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet, but in fact, they do,"" Ron Douglas, the study leader and a biologist at City University London, England, told LiveScience.

What purpose does being able to see UV light serve for animals such as reindeer, rodents, and other mammals? It allows reindeer to see polar bears, for example, which are nearly invisible in regular light because they blend in with the snow.

UV light also allows mammals to see urine trails. This would be helpful for predator animals, such as cats and dogs, to find food in the wild.

64,"Fungicides, disinfectants, plant-growth regulators, and fluoride. ",http://ethicalfoods.com/sprayed-produce-harvest/,"Are chemicals added to fresh fruits and vegetables after harvest?

We know that processed foods often contain a host of unhealthy additives, from fake flavors and colors to chemical preservatives. What you don’t know is that sometimes chemicals are added to fresh produce after it’s picked and before it gets to the grocery store.

When you buy an apple, a bag of potatoes or an orange, you’re probably under the impression that these fresh fruits and vegetables have only been washed clean before being stacked neatly in the produce section.

In addition to the chemicals used to grow produce, there are a host of post harvest chemicals and colorants applied: in the field, in washing water, in transport, in storage and in packaging. Unlike processed foods, there is no label on fresh food that tells us what they are.

Commonly used chemicals

Sodium orthophenylphenate (SOPP)

How it’s used: Fungicide which prevents or delays the appearance of rota and molds on produce.

Thiabendazole (TBZ)

How it’s used: Thiabendazole is used as a fungicide to control green mold, blue mold, and stem end rot on citrus fruits. It controls Cercospora leaf spot on sugar beets; crown rot on bananas; bluemold rot, bully eye rot, and gray mold on apples and pears; black rot, scurf and foot rot on sweet potatoes; and to control Fusarium (dry rot) in potato storage. It can be used on soybeans to reduce the severity of pod and stem blight such as anthracnose, brown spot, frogeye leaf spot and purple stain.

Sodium hypochlorite

How it’s used: The active ingredient of most liquid household bleaches, sodium hypochlorite is commonly used when the scale of postharvest chlorination is limited. It is used in postharvest management as an algicide, disinfectant, and sanitizer.

Sodium hypochlorite is an approved chemical for use in organic postharvest systems by under the USDA National Organic Program (NOP) Rule.

Maleic hydrazide

How it’s used: The compound is used to inhibit sprouting in potatoes, onions and carrots in storage, to induce dormancy in citrus fruits and as a plant-growth regulator to control growth of tobacco, potatoes, onions, non-bearing citrus, beans, beets, corn, lima beans, peas, strawberries, sugar beets, garlic and tomatoes.

In Austria and Denmark, use of maleic hydrazide is banned.

Sulfuryl fluoride

In January 2011, the EPA—prompted by a joint petition from the Fluoride Action Network (FAN), Environmental Working Group (EWG) and Beyond Pesticides—proposed the phase out of sulfuryl fluoride. The Pest Free Food Supply Act seeks to prevent the proposed phaseout of sulfuryl fluoride from taking effect. In 2014, the use of sulfuryl fluoride’s use in food production was protected, and it is still being applied on harvests.

How it’s used: fumigant applied to stored crops after harvest, leaving significant amounts of fluoride on treated foods. It is a substitute for the post-harvest crop storage uses of the pesticide methyl bromide.

Fluoride is neurotoxic. Over 30 published studies have reported an association between fluoride and reduced IQ in children, animal studies show that the brain is the main target for sulfuryl fluoride’s effects, and fumigation workers who use sulfuryl fluoride have been found to suffer impaired cognitive function. There is a growing consensus that American children are exposed to too much fluoride, in part because of the use of sulfuryl fluoride.

Sulfuryl fluoride is a potent greenhouse gas. Because of this, the Sierra Club, Center for Environmental Health, Defenders of Wildlife, and Center for Biological Diversity oppose efforts to expand sulfuryl fluoride production.

How are chemicals used post harvest?



Fungicides which prevent or delay the appearance of rota and molds in the product.

Examples are, sodium orthophenylphenate (SOPP), thiabendazole (TBZ), sodium hypochlorite, and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Methyl formate (Erinol), ethyl formate and (in some countries) ethylene oxide are frequently applied to dried fruits to kill infestations of insects and molds.

Sulphur dioxide, benzoic acid, propionic acid, ascorbic acid and sorbic acid are added to processed fruit products, especially juices, to inhibit the growth of yeasts and molds.

Chemicals that delay ripening or senescence.

Examples are: the kinins and kinetins that delay chlorophyll degradation and senescence in leafy vegetables; gibberellins that retard the ripening of tomatoes and hold citrus fruits on the tree beyond normal maturity; and auxins that delay deterioration of oranges and green beans.

Growth retardants that inhibit sprouting and growth.

Examples are maleic hydrazide which is applied pre-harvest and inhibits sprouting in a number of stored commodities, e.g., onions and potatoes. A number of chemicals are applied post-harvest to potatoes to control sprouting, for example, CIPC, TCNB and MENA.

Daminozide (Alar) increases fruit firmness, color and encourages early maturation in apples.

Chemicals that hasten ripening and senescence.

Examples are ethylene and compounds such as Ephephon that release ethylene, abscisin, ascorbic acid, ß hydroxyethyl hydrazine (BOH), acetylene and substances that release acetylene such as calcium carbide, and certain alcohols and fatty acids.

Chemicals that may hasten or delay ripening and senescence depending on the dose and the commodity on which they are used.

Examples are 2, 4-D; 2,4, 5-T; indoleacetic acid (IAA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA).

Metabolic inhibitors that block certain biochemical reactions that normally occur.

Examples are cycloheximide, actinomycin D, vitamin K, maleic acid, ethylene oxide, and carbon monoxide.

Fumigants to control insects or sometimes molds. Ethylene dibromide and methyl bromide are the most commonly used fumigants.

Coloring. The use of artificial colors is sometimes permitted in order to improve the appearance of a fruit.

For example, an orange may have artificial color added to the skin for cosmetic purposes.

Food additives. A number of compounds are permitted to be added to processed produce as preservatives, to alter texture or for cosmetic purposes.

The major preservatives are sulphur dioxide, benzoic acid or benzoates, and sorbic acid or sorbates.

Functional additives include antioxidants, coloring, flavoring, thickeners, emulsifiers, etc.

In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has the responsibility for registering agricultural chemicals and pesticides, and setting tolerances. The situation may be quite different in developing countries where governments usually do not have the expertise or analytical laboratories to monitor adequately the use of post-harvest chemicals on perishable crops.

",http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-just-discovered-where-hiv-began,"Diseases, while disastrous, often come and go in the public eye. We hear about ebola, but then another one quickly grabs national monitors and TV screens for its fifteen minutes.

However, one condition that seems to not fit into his norm is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

The spread of HIV is a story that would have most television dramas pale in comparison - combining elements of intrigue, suspense, and mystery into one cohesive nightmare that has blanketed the globe since the 1920s.

It all began in Kinshasha, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, in the 1920s, it was better known as the Belgian colony of Leopoldville.

A high profile location for young men to sojourn to in hopes of making a fortune, as it was the capital of Belgian Congo. Therefore, with them came railroads and sex workers.

Two forms of transportation that respectively spread people and infection. With a flourishing location, HIV found many opportunities to grow into the pandemic it is today.

The irony of it all is that HIV-1 group M, the type of HIV that originated in the colony, is responsible for about 90 percent of all infections, while HIV-1 group O, another type of HIV originating nearby is still quietly confined to West Africa.

Thereby suggesting it may have been the opportunities, and not the function, of that disease that enabled it to roar globally.

""Ecological rather than evolutionary factors drove its rapid spread,"" says Nuno Faria at the University of Oxford in the UK, in an interview with the BBC.

Faria and his colleagues were able to make this determination after they built a family tree of HIV by looking at a host of HIV genomes collected from about 800 infected people from central Africa.

Notably, by comparing two genome sequences and counting the differences in them, the team was able to figure out when the two last shared a common ancestor.

Ultimately, Faria determined that the HIV genomes all shared a common ancestor... one that existed no more than 100 years ago. To that end, they assert that it all likely began around 1920.

And with this information, they were able to place the virus to a specific city of origin - Kinshasa, which is now the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

All in all, the genetic assays that helped us localise the origin of the disease are still underway to help us identify points of public health intervention that may help us reduce the spread of the infection. Because, although we may know where it came from, we have yet to figure out where it will end.

",http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-great-pyramid-of-giza-is-slightly-wonky/,"The Great Pyramid of Giza is so seemingly well-built that explanations of how the ancient Egyptians constructed it over 4,500 years ago have been filled with controversy, confusion, and mysticism. And sometimes even aliens. However, according to a new study, the engineering behind it might not be as bang-on as we once thought.

The study by the Glen Dash Research Foundation and the Ancient Egypt Research Associates has discovered that the Great Pyramid doesn’t have a perfectly square base, with one particularly lopsided west-facing edge.

Engineer Glen Dash and Egyptologist Mark Lehner looked for the original edges to the 138-meter (455 feet) tall Great Pyramid of Giza, the largest of the three pyramids found in Giza, just across the River Nile from Egypt's capital, Cairo.

When it was first constructed, under the rule of Pharaoh Khufu, the pyramid was lined with a white limestone casing. Over the centuries, this outer casing was stripped for use in other building projects and left the pyramid how we see it now. Much of this outer edge is too damaged to be of any use, however, the researchers managed to pinpoint 84 points of the original boundary around the pyramid’s 920-meter (3,020 feet) periphery.

Using this data they plotted out the lengths of the pyramid's four sides. The east side measured between 230.295 to 230.373 meters (755.561 to 755.817 feet) in length. However, the west side was around 230.378 to 230.436 meters (755.833 and 756.024 feet). That means the west side could be more than 14 centimeters (5.5 inches) longer than the east.

So, not too bad considering it was built 4,500 years ago. As the researchers say in the study “The data show that the Egyptians possessed quite remarkable skills for their time… We can only speculate as to how the Egyptians could have laid out these lines with such precision using only the tools they had.”

Scientists aren't sure what it is, but they agree it is something ""quite sizeable,"" either a living thing or a natural process. ",http://www.iflscience.com/environment/something-absolutely-gigantic-appears-whistling-caribbean-sea/,"The Bahamas, as seen from space. There's something in the water... Tim Peake/NASA/ESA

Scientists love a good mystery, and the oceans of the world – being massive, deep, dark, and inherently enigmatic places – are literally full of them. The latest conundrum comes courtesy of the Caribbean Sea, wherein a very low-pitch sound, one well beyond the hearing range of humans, can be heard. In fact, something down there is so huge and mobile that it's generating waves in Earth’s gravitational field.

A team of researchers, led by the University of Liverpool (UL), were in the middle of conducting an expedition to the Atlantic Ocean-based Caribbean Sea, which covers an area of roughly 2,754,000 square kilometers (1,063,000 square miles). Their original objective was to study the dynamic sea currents within the basin, which links up to the Gulf Stream, critical for delivering heat to, among other places, Western Europe.

Writing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the authors describe how their instrumentation picked up something they describe as a “whistle”. The note itself is an A-flat. Something quite sizeable is clearly making its presence known, but initially, it was unclear whether the noise was emanating from something living or another natural process.

It's probably not this. Antonio Maletin/Shutterstock

Taking sea level and pressure readings from the bottom of the basin, assessing the frequency and magnitude of the regional tides, using satellites to measure small changes in the local gravity, and feeding this all into multiple models of oceanic current activity based on a period of time from 1958 to 2013, the team began to suspect the noise was not, sadly, coming from a gigantic sea monster.",2016-06-23 08:37:35

So far, it’s squished everything from bowling balls to non-Newtonian fluid . But now they must face nature's hardest substance: diamond.

The diamond was donated to the channel by a generous diamond retailer looking to jump on the viral bandwagon. As stated in the video, it’s a 1.2 carat jewel and worth at least $4,000, complete with its own certificate to prove it’s the real deal.

So, as Lauri Vuohensilta – the mad genius behind the channel – says in the video: “They say diamonds are forever, but how long?”

As it turns out, not very long.

So, how was the diamond broken so easily? As some have pointed out, the “hardness” that diamonds are known for only really refers to their ability to be scratch-resistant. While the covalent bonds between the diamond atoms themselves are extremely strong, diamonds can also be brittle, especially if there’s any kind of defect or it’s been poorly cut. Scientists have even discovered materials that are actually harder than diamonds, such as wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite.

Usually this was because, as we know, she had some memory issues.

But even though Dory was able to work through her worry (thanks to her “just keep swimming” mantra), Finding Nemo and its upcoming sequel, Finding Dory, has some marine biologists pretty worried, according to an article in The Wrap. After Finding Nemo, people everywhere wanted to have a little Nemo for themselves. The original movie’s popularity led to a 40% rise in the sale of clownfish everywhere. But that wasn’t too much of an issue since clownfish can be safely bred in captivity and do ok in personal tanks.

But Dory is no clownfish. She’s a blue tang fish, which are much rarer than clownfish and don’t do nearly as well in tanks. If Finding Dory leads to the same demand for blue tang fish that Finding Nemo did for clown fish, there could be some problems. Blue tang fish are found in areas around Indonesia and the Philippines, where there aren’t very many rules or regulations about large-scale fish collection. This means, if there’s too much demand for these fish as pets, there’s nothing really stopping people from going out and gathering lots of them (and majorly destroying ecosystems in the process).

71,"Over 80 studies of vitamin D were re-evaluated and found to provide insufficient evidence, therefore the claims remain mere hypothesis (not ""debunked""). 
Thank you Francois!",http://www.mentalfloss.com/article/81861/researchers-debunk-medical-myths-about-vitamin-d,"We are constantly bombarded with conflicting headlines about nutrition and ads for products that promise to make or keep us healthy. Sorting out the truth from the hooey is an uphill battle, but science can help. A team of researchers have examined 10 common claims about vitamin D, and found that most of them lack evidence. They published their findings in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

Lead researcher Michael Allan is the director of Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Alberta. He and his colleagues reviewed more than 80 studies on vitamin D, looking for support for claims that the vitamin can reduce cancer risk, treat arthritis, and more. The team was somewhat surprised by their results; ""Even areas that we really thought there was good evidence for benefit early on, don't seem to be bearing out,"" Allan said in a press statement. In other words, we should rein in our enthusiasm for a ""vitamin D panacea,"" as the authors call it.

The results showed insufficient evidence for eight popular beliefs about vitamin D supplementation:

That it can treat depression;

That it can treat rheumatoid arthritis;

That it can treat multiple sclerosis;

That it can prevent respiratory tract infections;

That it lowers cancer risk and mortality;

That it reduces overall mortality;

That taking a higher dose is better; and

That healthy adults should get their vitamin D levels checked regularly.

The remaining two out of the ten beliefs tested were backed by some evidence. The researchers found that vitamin D supplementation can help reduce the risk of falls and the risk of fracture from falls in older people. But even those benefits are minimal, Allan says.

“If you were to take a group of people who were at higher risk of breaking a bone—so had about a 15 per cent chance of breaking a bone over the next 10 years—and treated all of them with a reasonable dose of vitamin D for a decade, you'd prevent a fracture in around one in 50 of them over that time. Many people would say taking a drug for 10 years to stop one in every 50 fractures is probably not enough to be meaningful.”

Now, just because something hasn’t been proved doesn’t mean it’s wrong. Allan says a lot of the existing vitamin D research was poorly done, and there hasn’t been much of it. It’s possible that, in the future, research will find enough evidence to support some of these claims. But right now, it just isn't there.

Because the average large egg contains between 180 and 186 milligrams of cholesterol, just one immediately counts for over half of your recommended daily intake, the Huffington Post reports. However, it's a little more complicated than that: It turns out cholesterol is actually already being produced, in rather significant amounts, by your body – 1 to 2 grams each day on average. But when you consume foods that contain cholesterol, your body's production of the substance decreases to make up for it. You don't really add cholesterol to existing amounts, you're replacing one kind with another.

Authority Nutrition makes another excellent point: While cholesterol has negative connotations for obvious reasons, it is not a purely harmful molecule. Cholesterol is a vital part of the body, and is essential in creating testosterone, estrogen and cortisol. The website also reports a study where a group of individuals took to eating one to three whole eggs a day. For 70 percent of those people, eggs did not negatively affect cholesterol levels. For the remaining 30 percent, the issue was fairly benign as well: Eggs were found to change LDL cholesterol (the harmful variety) from small, dense molecules to larger ones, which made them a lot less of a threat. One damper on the good news, however: Eggs are found to cause an increased risk of heart disease in diabetics, Authority Nutrition says.

Now that we've dispelled most of the negative preconceptions about eggs, let's explore the advantages to their regular consumption:

1. Nutrients

Eggs are rich in several different types of nutrients, according to the Huffington Post: They're rich in vitamins A, D, E and B-12, as well as iron, folate, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, among others, all of which are extremely important.

2. Protein

Eggs provide the highest-quality protein, with a much higher rating than milk or beef. You'd need about 30 grams of meat to equate to a single egg, which is much less expensive.

3. Choline

Choline, a nutrient you don't frequently hear about, is nonetheless very important for the brain. It helps promote growth and memory function. Choline supplements are especially crucial for pregnant mothers, where most of the woman's choline supplies will be sent to her child and she will be left with a critically low amount. 90 percent of people are lacking in choline. Eggs contain plenty of this nutrient.

4. Eyesight

Eggs are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that gather in the eye region and protect your eyes from dangerous light wavelengths, as well as lower the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.

5. Weight control

Eggs help with satiety, meaning they make you feel fuller than many other foods. People who start the day with some eggs in their breakfast feel much less hungry throughout the day, which allows them to take smaller meals.

6. Bones, hair and nails

The vitamin D and calcium mentioned previously are of great importance for the bones, helping them grow stronger. Eggs help prevent osteoporosis this way. In addition, the amino acids and minerals in eggs promote healthier hair and nails, the website says.

So should you eat three eggs a day? Authority Nutrition recommends it, saying the benefits are much stronger than the downsides. But ""Today"" reports such an intake in eggs can lead to carotid plaque buildup in the arteries, as well as an increased risk in heart attack and stroke due to the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide, a somewhat harmful chemical.

The Huffington Post suggests varying up your diet a bit, stating three eggs a day can be a bit much. However, there's clearly no reason not to enjoy more than one of these a day – especially if you prefer free-range eggs to the supermarket variety, which has been found to provide a lot less nutrients.

78,Yes. It's a natural uranium ore deposit that was discovered in 1972. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/there-really-ancient-nuclear-reactor-africa/,"An ancient nuclear reactor that was churning away 2 billion years ago sounds like a myth. Maybe it's because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure. But in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the Earth's crust, found in Okla, Gabon. Uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions.

The natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. The pile of rock in the ground in Okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago!

It was discovered in 1972, when some French scientists took uranium ore from the mine in Gabon to test its uranium content. Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions.

One would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium.",2016-06-18 10:01:12
79,"An inconclusive study shows that heavy, daily marijuana use may affect the reward centers of the brain in a manner similar to addiction. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-something-strange-when-they-looked-at-the-brains-of-pot-smokers,"Marijuana's official designation as a Schedule 1 drug – something with ""no accepted medical use"" – means it is pretty tough to study. Yet numerous anecdotal reports, as well as some studies, have linked marijuana with several purported health benefits, from pain relief to helping with certain forms of epilepsy.

Still, experts say more rigorous scientific analyses are needed. Use of marijuana, a psychoactive drug, can come with risks, especially in people who may be prone to addiction or mental illness. And now, for the first time, researchers have found a link between daily decade-long weed use and a difference in how the brain processes reward.

For years, researchers have suggested that such a link exists – and if it does, that it could play a powerful role in addiction. An important part of this line of thought is that addicts, far from amoral individuals incapable of making intelligent decisions, simply respond differently to drugs – neurologically, psychologically, physiologically – than people who are not addicted.

And this response is probably the result of many factors outside the person's control, including genetics, behaviour, and environment.

So for their study, published on Wednesday in the journal Human Brain Mapping, researchers at the Centre for BrainHealth at the University of Texas, Dallas, took a look at the brains of 53 daily long-term pot users (14 of whom met the American Psychiatric Association's criteria for addiction) and 68 people who'd never used the drug daily.

Then the researchers showed them a series of objects meant to test their reward response. The objects included one type of fruit (the ""natural cue""), a pencil (the ""neutral cue""), and either a bong, a pipe, or a joint (the ""cannabis cue""), depending on which one the participant said they preferred.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP/File

Importantly, this study did not look at so-called recreational users – those who use the drug every few weeks or months. Instead, it focused on people who used the drug every day for an average of 12 years, several of whom met the criteria for being addicted to the drug, and many of whom displayed some signs of past or present problems with weed.

Why? Because the researchers wanted to tease out how changes to the brain's reward pathway might affect those who used the drug every day for years – and, more importantly, why.

Not surprisingly, when the chronic users were presented with either the bong, pipe, or joint, they displayed a stronger response in several parts of their brain linked with reward than they did when they were shown the fruit cues.

In contrast, the non-users did not show a significantly greater response to either the weed or fruit cues, and some parts of their brains showed a greater response to the fruit than to the bong, pipe, or joint.

""We found that marijuana disrupts the brain's natural reward circuitry, making marijuana highly salient to heavy users,"" Francesca Filbey, the director of cognitive neuroscience research of addictive disorders at the Centre for BrainHealth and an associate professor in the School of Behavioural and Brain Sciences, told Business Insider.

""In essence, these brain alterations could be a marker of transition from recreational marijuana use to problematic use,"" she said.

The orbitofrontal cortex, highlighted in green.

Marijuana and the brain

In another 2014 study also by Filbey, she and her team found that, compared with people who didn't use pot, long-term, heavy users tended to have a smaller orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region critical for processing emotions and making decisions.

And, interestingly enough, the heavy users also appeared to have more cross-brain connections. Scientists think regular users may develop these links as a means of compensating for the difference in size. The regular pot users also had lower IQ scores overall when compared with the people who didn't use the drug.

To arrive at their results – one of the first comprehensive, 3D pictures of the brains of adults who'd smoked weed at least four times a week, often multiple times a day, for years – the researchers used a combination of MRI-based brain scans.

Still, that study did not show that chronic weed use caused certain regions of the brain to shrink, or that pot use caused lower IQ scores – it simply showed a relationship among those factors.

""We cannot honestly say that that is what's happening here,"" Filbey told Business Insider in 2014.

Similarly, the latest study does not show that chronic pot use causes a change in the brain's reward response; the reverse could also be true, that the changed reward response influenced the chronic pot use.

81,"No. It's a panorama camera glitch paired with ""psychological priming"" since the hotel advertises itself as being haunted and is the location of the filming of ""The Shining"". ",http://www.livescience.com/54462-mysterious-figure-stanley-hotel-is-ghost-glitch.html,"A visitor to a famous—and famously haunted—hotel in Colorado claims to have captured a ghostly image.

According to a CNN story, ""Tourist Henry Yau recently took a picture at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which appears to show two ghostly apparitions standing on a staircase.

In the photo, a woman can be seen at the top of the stairs in a period outfit with a child beside her."" The photo has gone viral, leaving many scratching their heads and others heading to the Stanley to see for themselves.

American Horror Stories: Ghosts and Hauntings

Many commenters on social media think it's a ghost (or two), and several amateur ghost hunters have weighed in suggesting it's unexplainable. Others, however, have a pretty good idea of what it is. Researcher Kenny Biddle of the Geeks & Ghosts podcast and the ""I am Kenny Biddle"" blog, examined the photo and noted that Yau used the panoramic feature on his iPhone to capture a full view of the grand stairwell.

This offers a clue because the in panorama mode the camera doesn't just take one photo but instead scans across the scene rapidly. Biddle notes that ""Panoramic images are not taken in the same fraction of a second as a normal images are. They take several seconds … which would allow Yau to start taking his panoramic image at one end of the room, and another guest or two to hit the halfway point down the stairs, turn the corner, and begin the second set of stairs to the floor as Yau ends his panoramic image on the other side of the room.""

Odd glitches using the panorama function on cameras are common, and many websites display hundreds of bizarre and double images. A Tumblr account titled ""Panorama Fail"" offers dozens of accidental digital grotesqueries. The ""ghost"" is ""most likely just a guest that was captured coming down the stairs while a panoramic image was taken over the course of several seconds,"" Biddle concludes.

British Viral 'Ghost Photo' Explained

Though some have dismissed the image as an artifact of the panorama feature, Biddle notes that ""when looking at a close up of the alleged ghost and second ghost (to the left of the more solid looking figure), we see that the features of both figures match up: the hair, the spaghetti-strap top, the height of the head, shoulders, and the top of the dress. This is a double image of the same person, not someone else. This effect was caused by the low light environment, slower scanning speed due to the camera trying to take in more light, and the movement of this person as they rounded the corner.""

Yau claims that he doesn't remember seeing anyone at the top of the staircase when he took the photo, but it's quite possible that he simply didn't notice the woman as she appeared and turned at the top of the stairs, as he was trying to hold the camera steady and take the photo. (Yau also claimed that he waited until there was no one in the area when taking the photo, though two people can be clearly seen on the left side of the photo.)

How the unexpected hotel guest was dressed likely also played a role in how her image was interpreted; she seems to be wearing a classic black or dark dress (as befits a fancy, well-known hotel); had she been wearing a yellow blazer and carrying a large Target shopping bag speculations about her spectral origins would likely have been scuttled.

Video: Do Ghosts Exist?

Creepy Context

Upon closer inspection there is nothing remarkable in the image; it's a perfectly ordinary blurry, double image common in long exposure and panoramic iPhone photographs. Had it been taken in any number of other locations, it would not likely have attracted such attention. So why is image played up as a mystery? The answer lies in its context.

Context plays two roles in the creation of ""spooky"" photos. Most people (that is, non-professional photographers) routinely take photos that are flawed in some way, or that have odd or unusual images in them, including flash reflected ""orbs,"" odd shadows, blurry body parts, double exposures, objects behind a person seemingly coming out of their heads, and so on. Usually they are ignored or deleted, unless the photographer (or someone else) decides that there's some reason why the photo might be of something supernatural.

The photo was taken at a doubly famous hotel—not only is it where the Stephen King-scripted, Stanley Kubrick-directed horror classic ""The Shining"" was filmed, but it's also claimed to be one of the most haunted hotels in the country. In fact the hotel specifically advertises itself as a paranormal destination and caters to ghost hunting tourists. Because of this, guests there are more likely to see ghosts (in person and in photos) than in comparable non-haunted lodgings—and this is true whether ghosts exist or not.

Ghost Stories: The Science Behind Sightings

This is because of a psychological process called priming, in which our expectations can influence our interpretations. To some degree we see what we want or expect to see—and that can include ghosts. People who are aware of a building's haunted reputation are more likely to take many photos, and anything odd or even potentially mysterious in those photos is likely to be considered evidence of ghosts.

A person could take an equal number of similar odd photos at a location not assumed to be haunted—a local supermarket or lake shore, for example—and the odd photographic artifact would not be as closely examined nor interpreted as anything mysterious, just a flawed photo.

The second contextual factor is of course that the Stanley hotel and others like it have a vested economic interest in promoting such photos as ghostly—or at the very least maintaining an agnostic stance about them. This isn't necessarily cynicism but pragmatism: There is no publicity to be gained by casting any doubt a claimed ghost photo taken in their hotel that's making news.

Biddle told Discovery News, ""This is a classic example of inexperienced investigators and fluff piece media jumping the gun and promoting an easily explainable anomaly as something supernatural rather than doing legitimate investigative/detective work to figure out the mystery. It's the reason paranormal investigation remains in the land of pseudoscience."" Whether ghosts haunt the Stanley remains to be seen, but it's unlikely that Yau's staircase double exposure is one of them.

82,"Scientist's aren't sure yet, but they do display REM-like patterns with high and low brain frequency during sleep. ",http://www.livescience.com/54593-do-australian-dragons-dream.html,"Australian dragons cycle through more than 350 episodes of rapid eye movement and slow-wave sleep each night, spending about half their sleeping hours in each phase.

Do dragons dream? Maybe, according to new research that finds rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep in a lizard, the Australian dragon, for the first time.

The discovery suggests that these phases of sleep may be more than 100 million years older than previously realized.

REM sleep is characterized by brain waves that look similar to waking brain activity. In mammals, the large muscles of the body are immobile, but the eyes twitch randomly during REM sleep. People do most of their dreaming in this phase of sleep. Slow-wave sleep is a non-REM sleep phase that is marked by slow brain waves called delta waves. [Top 10 Spooky Sleep Disorders]

Sleep's missing link?

Quiet, sleep-like periods are known in many animals, even invertebrates like fruit flies. However, researchers had only found REM and slow-wave sleep brain activity in mammals and birds. Both of those kinds of animals diverged from a common group, the amniotes — mammals, reptiles and birds that lay eggs on land or hold them in their bodies — more than 300 million years ago. The amniotes gave rise to the synapsids and the sauropsids. Mammals are the only group of synapsids left (the earliest arose about 195 million years ago). The sauropsids encompassed the dinosaurs as well as modern birds and reptiles.

The fact that sleep appeared only in these two disparate branches of the evolutionary tree was puzzling, said lead study researcher Gilles Laurent, a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Germany. It seemed that mammals and birds had independently evolved the brain patterns for REM and slow-wave sleep — a case of convergent evolution — or, more confusingly, that these sleep patterns were an ancestral trait that was lost multiple times among reptile lineages but somehow not in birds.

The new research, which will be published Friday (April 29) in the journal Science, suggests a much simpler explanation: REM and slow-wave sleep were present in a common amniote ancestor, and the fingerprints of these brain patterns had been missed until now.

""It poses many questions: How did sleep start? What did it start for? Is sleep the way that we understand it today in mammals, including humans, the same thing as what it started as?"" Laurent told Live Science. ""These questions are ones we'd like to find answers to.""

REM sleep in reptiles

Laurent and his colleagues didn't intend to study sleep, at first. His lab is interested in how the cortex works, and he uses lizards as model organisms to study this brain region. The researchers were using electrodes implanted in the brains of Australian dragons (Pogona vitticeps) to record brain activity.

An Australian dragon (Pogona vitticeps), the first lizard ever discovered to have mammalian-like brain patterns during sleep. The discovery, reported April 29 in the journal Science, suggests that the evolution of this brain activity may date back at least 320 million years. (Image credit: Dr. Stephan Junek, Max Planck Institute for Brain Research)

""In the middle of some experiments we were doing, we decided to let the recordings go overnight after a day's work, just to see what would happen during the night,"" Laurent said. ""And upon analyzing the results, there were interesting oscillations of activity that were very regular, that suggested the potential existence of sleep-related patterns of activity in the brain.""

Further recordings of the brains of five different lizards of the same species revealed two distinct sleep patterns. One showed high-frequency wave forms of about 20 cycles per second. The other showed low-frequency wave forms of less than 4 cycles per second. Video recordings of the sleeping lizards showed that during the high-frequency brain activity, the dragons' eyes twitched periodically.

""We had a characterization that was starting to become more and more like what we observe in mammalian sleep,"" Laurent said. ""A REM phase with broadband activity and high-frequency activity, and slow-wave sleep where there is no eye movement."" [What Do Dogs Dream About?]

The slow waves also showed negative spikes of electrical potential 200 to 400 milliseconds long, interrupted with an oscillation of the brain's electrical activity, Laurent said. These ""sharp waves"" and ""ripples"" are seen in the slow brain waves of mammalian sleep, he said.

Modern equipment and analysis techniques likely allowed Laurent and his team to find these brain patterns where others had failed, Laurent said.

There are differences between the sleep of lizards and mammals, however. In humans, for example, the REM phase of the sleep cycle is relatively short. A person might experience just 5 minutes per hour of slow-wave sleep at the beginning of the night, and then, as this phase gradually lengthens, 15 or 20 minutes per 90 minutes of slow-wave sleep later on. In the Australian dragon, the ratio of REM to slow-wave sleep is about 50-50. And the dragon cycles between the two every minute or minute and a half. They experience up to 350 sleep cycles per night, compared to four or five in humans.

These patterns arose in a brain region called the dorsal ventricular ridge, which doesn't exist in mammals, Laurent said. The sleep patterns seen in the study were similar to the ones seen in the mouse hippocampus during sleep, but strangely, the dorsal ventricular ridge is not analogous in its connections or neural cell makeup to the mammal hippocampus at all, Laurent said.

Do Australian dragons dream?

The research suggests that REM and slow-wave sleep may have evolved in the amniotes, but the patterns found in the lizards studied may be even older, Laurent said. Amphibian sleep has been studied and sleep patterns have not been found, he said, but perhaps scientists need to check again.

In humans, REM sleep is closely associated with dreaming. So do Australian dragons dream? There's no way to be sure right now, Laurent said. The answer may also depend on how you define dreaming. Under a strict definition in which dreaming requires higher cognition, the answer might be no. But if dreaming were defined as a replay of brain activity during sleep that resembles brain activity during wakefulness, lizards might well dream, Laurent said.

""Maybe in a few years, we'll be able to tell you,"" he said.

83,"Not in a traditional sense but they do display a circadian rhythm, drooping their branches at night and rising again just before the sun rises. Other flowers and trees open and close leaves/petals at certain times regardless of sunlight exposure. ",http://www.livescience.com/54864-do-trees-sleep.html,"After a long a long day of photosynthesizing, do trees fall asleep?

It depends on how you define ""sleep,"" but trees do relax their branches at night, which might be a sign of snoozing, scientists said.

In the only reported study to look at tree siestas, researchers set up lasers that measured the movements of two silver birch trees (Betula pendula) at night. One tree was in Finland and the other in Austria, and both were monitored from dusk until morning on dry, windless nights in September. This was close to the solar equinox, when daylight and nighttime are about equal. [What Is the Oldest Tree in the World?]

The laser scanners used infrared light to illuminate different parts of the tree, each for fractions of a second. This provided enough detail to map each tree within minutes, the researchers said.

The silver birches' branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found.

Trees might sleep after dark, according to precise laser measurements that detected the plants' branches drooping at night. (Image credit: Eetu Puttonen)

""Our results show that the whole tree droops during night, which can be seen as position change in leaves and branches,"" study lead author Eetu Puttonen, a researcher at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, said in a statement. ""The changes are not too large, only up to 10 centimeters [4 inches] for trees with a height of about 5 meters [16 feet].""

It's unclear if the sun ""woke up"" the trees or if they relied on their own internal circadian rhythm, the researchers said. But ""the fact that some branches started returning to their daytime position already before sunrise would suggest this [internal circadian clock] hypothesis [is right],"" the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online on Feb. 29, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.

The finding isn't too surprising, but oddly enough it hadn't been studied until now, the researchers said. Most living organisms have day and night circadian rhythms, and any gardener will notice that some plants open their flowers in the morning and that some trees close their leaves at night, the researchers said.

The famed botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) found that flowers confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed, and naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) noted that the nocturnal movement of leaves and stalks on plants looked like sleep.

However, their studies concentrated on small plants grown in pots. The finding in trees represents the first study to use lasers to precisely measure the nighttime movements of wild trees, the researchers said.

The tree study didn't address why the branches and leaves drooped at night, but it's likely related to the turgidity, or the internal water pressure within the tree, the researchers said.

""Plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cells, which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis,"" said study co-author András Zlinszky, a researcher at the Centre for Ecological Research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. [How Tall Can Trees Grow?]

The researchers said in the future, they plan to examine the water movement within each tree and compare it to measurements made by the laser scans. ""This will give us a better understanding of the trees' daily tree water use and their influence on the local or regional climate,"" Puttonen said.

84,Only pathogen-free blood and no more than a few teaspoons otherwise it becomes toxic because of its high iron content that our bodies cannot process. ,http://www.livescience.com/15899-drinking-blood-safe.html,"With such a high interest in vampires these days — they're all over television, movies, and bookstore shelves — many people may be wondering if humans really can survive as vampires.

Turns out, sucking blood isn't just fiction fun: In 2011, a 19-year-old Texas man named Lyle Bensley allegedly broke into a woman's apartment and bit her on the neck. This was not bedroom playacting between lovers; Bensley claimed to be a centuries-old vampire who needed blood to stay alive. The woman escaped and called police, and Lyle the would-be vampire was arrested for assault.

But is it safe to drink blood?

Related: How much blood is in the human body?

In very small amounts (say, a few teaspoons), and if the blood is free from pathogens (such as the many blood-borne diseases), blood might not harm you. Beyond that, watch out.

The strange fact is, blood, when drank, is toxic. When confined to places where blood is supposed to be — such as the heart, vessels, and so on — it is essential for life. But when ingested it's a very different story. Of course all toxins have doses, and just as a tiny bit of poison won't necessarily harm you, the more you eat or drink, the greater the danger.

Related: 7 strange ways that people act like vampires

(Image credit: Isabell Schatz)

Because blood is so rich in iron — and because the body has difficulty excreting excess iron — any animal that consumes blood regularly runs a risk of iron overdose. While iron is necessary for all animals (and indeed most life), in high doses it can be toxic. This condition, called haemochromatosis, can cause a wide variety of diseases and problems, including liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders.

Even so, blood-feeding in humans seems to be more common than one might expect. John Edgar Browning of Georgia Tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a BBC article that thousands of people across the United States drink blood for various reasons. Some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by Browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn't overdo the blood meals: ""No vampire I’ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood,"" Browning said, according to BBC.

Unlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. According to Katherine Ramsland in her book ""The Science of Vampires"" (Penguin Putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, ""requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. When ingested, the blood goes through a tract that's adapted for extracting nutrients. Research on this system suggests that bats have a mucous membrane along the intestinal tract that acts as a barrier to prevent too much iron from getting into their bloodstreams.""

You, however, are not a vampire bat. Because humans did not evolve such an iron-extracting mechanism, drinking blood can kill us.

If you're thinking of sampling human blood, make sure there's a doctor handy — for you, not your victim.

Not only does it work like a regular leaf, but research shows it's possible for it to be 49% more efficient. All it needs is a little sunlight and water to work. The leaf uses a special silk material that makes it possible for chloroplasts to live and do their thing, and chloroplasts are where the magic of turning CO2 into oxygen happens. Chloroplasts become the engine of the leaves that only need CO2 and sunlight as 'fuel' to run, and emits oxygen as its 'waste.' The engine's process is called photosynthesis, and the chloroplasts of a leaf is where photosynthesis happens. The fact that these silky things can actually carry out the process of photosynthesis with such little effort is what makes them so incredible and useful.

87,Yes.,http://www.livescience.com/55086-deep-breathing-stress.html,"A new app from Apple coaches you through breathing exercises, but do these exercises really help reduce stress?

This week, Apple announced a number of new features for the Apple Watch, including an app due out this fall called Breathe, which will ""encourage users to take a moment in their day to do deep breathing exercises for relaxation and stress reduction,"" the company said in a statement.

The app will guide users though a timed breathing session, lasting 1 to 5 minutes. The watch can track a user's heart rate, and so at the end of a session, users will see a summary of their heart rate data, Apple said.

Although some experts recommend up to 20 minutes of breathing exercises a day, just 5 minutes of breathing exercises can help people feel calmer and refreshed, said Nancy Harazduk, director of the Mind-Body Medicine Program at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C.

Studies suggest that deep-breathing exercises may reduce certain types of stress and anxiety, and can temporarily lower blood pressure. But many of these studies have been small, so more research is needed to learn more about the exact benefits of deep-breathing exercises, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

Deep breathing is a type of relaxation technique that is intended to counteract the body's normal response to stress, the ""fight or flight"" response. Deep breathing lowers heart rate and reduces levels of stress hormones, according to the NCCIH.

And because deep breathing dilates blood vessels, it can also lower blood pressure, Harazduk said .

In addition, when you breathe deeply, you take in more oxygen, which may help improve your mental concentration and release endorphins that increase feelings of well-being, she told Live Science .

Focusing on breathing can also take your mind off stressful thoughts. ""One of the ways of letting go thoughts of anxiety or stress is by focusing on our breathing,"" Harazduk said. [11 Tips to Lower Stress]

Studies show that deep breathing and other relaxation techniques may reduce anxiety in people undergoing certain medical procedures, such as breast biopsies or dental treatment, the NCCIH said. A 2013 study from researchers in South Korea found that burn patients who practiced breathing exercises had lower scores on measures of pain and anxiety when doctors treated their burns, compared with people who didn't practice the breathing exercises.

Deep breathing might also help with some day-to-day stresses. A 2013 study from researchers at Tufts University found that people who had anxiety about taking math tests performed better on the tests, and reported feeling calmer, if they practiced a breathing exercise beforehand.

However, breathing exercises by themselves may not be the best treatment for people with generalized anxiety disorder, a mental health condition in which people find it hard to control their anxiety, according to the NCCIH. Studies suggest that people with generalized anxiety disorder who are treated with psychotherapy do better than those who practice relaxation techniques alone.

And although breathing exercises can lower blood pressure in the short term, it's not certain how long these effects last. The Food and Drug Administration approved a device called Resperate, which helps people slow their breathing, to reduce stress and lower blood pressure. A review study conducted by the British Hypertension Society, which included nearly 500 patients, found that the device did lower blood pressure, by about 3.7 millimeters of mercury for systolic and 2.5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure, on average.

But the longest-duration study in the review was nine weeks. The Society said that, because the effect was small and the studies were short, it could not recommend Resperate at this time.

Deep-breathing techniques should not be used as a replacement for conventional care, or to postpone seeing a doctor for a health problem, the NCCIH said.

The Breathe app will be available in the fall with the next update to the Apple Watch operating system, called watchOS 3.

(There are no results of someone actually drinking only water for a month, the article only discusses the benefits of water in general.) ",http://www.lifebuzz.com/drink-water/,"Water is crucial to basically everything in our bodies. When it comes to drinking water, there are two things that most of us know: One, water is good for us (Probably better than anything else). Two, most of us don't drink enough of it -- after all, it's pretty tough to get those eight eight-ounce glasses each and every day. But do you know the specific reasons why water is great for you, beyond your average run-of-the-mill hydration? From blood to heart health to bones and skin, water can be beneficial on virtually every level and we've compiled some information that will encourage you to make sure you stay hydrated. And, now that it's summer, you really can't argue with at least eight glasses of water a day: It will keep you healthy, cool, and totally energetic during the heat of these oppressive summer days. Find out why you shouldn't skimp on the H2O -- all summer long and beyond.After all, 90% of your body is water -- it needs to be replenished in order to function properly.

But there's actually a lot that people don't know about the benefits of drinking water. And it's more than just quenching your thirst.

For starters, water can help you lose weight. And it contributes to weight loss in more ways than one.

For starters, water helps satiate you. People who drink more water have less of a tendency to overeat, because they know when they are full. Nicola Locatelli

When it comes to weight loss, water also acts as a detoxifier. Think about it: Most other drinks have sugar, which lead to weight gain. All water does is help flush out those nasty toxins. USAID U.S

It can also increase your metabolism. Drinking as much water as possible boosts your metabolism by up to 24%. Drink ice cold water for best results. as it shocks your system into working just a bit harder. Helga Weber

Beyond weight loss, water has a number of other benefits as well. There's basically not a single part of the body that healthy water intake doesn't help. Aikawa Ke

For starters, it keeps your heart healthy by keeping your blood thin. Water prevents your blood from getting too thick, making heart attacks less of a threat, and to keep clots from forming.

It also helps keep your brain sharp. A recent study showed that drinking 8 to 10 cups of water a day can increase your brain power by up to 30%. Staying hydrated can help increase mental clarity and focus as well.

And it's not just milk that keeps your bones healthy. Water increases bone strength by adding a protective barrier around them, and strengthening cartilage. monkeywing

Frequent water consumption can help slow down the aging process. It really makes the skin healthy and young looking by stimulating collagen and cell reproduction. refeelwater / instagram

Water also decreases your risk of stroke. The same way that water can reduce your risk of heart attack, studies have shown that it can also prevent strokes.

Not to mention the positive effect it has on your joints. It also increases flexibility and keeps the connective tissue strong. In other words, drinking water will totally keep your yoga game strong. wallace_Lan

And if we're getting back down to basics, there's the matter of water keeping your cool and energized. It is summer, after all. It can get hot out there, and water is the best possible salvation. Jeremy Brooks",2016-06-16 21:32:00

But there is one thing that may be hurting you when you are in dream land and you don't even know. Your sleep position may actually be negatively impacting your overall health and it's relying on one side that is the most damaging.

Digestion gets extra help when you choose the correct side. Waste moves from the large intestine to the colon partly due to gravity when you turn to the left. This may explain people having a bowel movement as soon as they get up in the morning.

Pregnant women can also benefit moving to this side. Women who are pregnant need to switch to this side immediately. It allows for proper blood flow to the heart for both mommy and baby. It also helps to relive the pressure from your back. Furthermore, it keeps the uterus from squeezing the liver. planetchopstick

91,"No one is sure, but if they do it has no smell. ",http://www.dailydot.com/geek/do-birds-fart/?fb=ss&prtnr=mentalfloss,"Have you ever wondered, “Do birds fart?” No? Well maybe now we’ve sparked your curiosity.

They don’t fart—detectably. There’s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn’t seem like anyone has ever truly observed—or more importantly, measured—a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate?

As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don’t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird’s gastrointestinal tract, he’d be concerned something was wrong with the bird.

But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there’s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected.

In another blog post, she describes the only written account she’s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master’s thesis on blue jays.

One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas.

Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod’s observation.) He also acknowledges that the “wisp of whitish gas” could also have simply been water vapor—steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog’s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)

It’s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that “the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment” and break down into its smellier components—namely sulfur. So if birds don’t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn’t smell it.

Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.

But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air?

As far as we could tell, this isn’t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab’s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart “in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.” He also said that he’s never personally noticed a bird fart.

Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying “excuse me” after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird’s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. And without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.",2016-06-15 08:18:38
92,"To prevent the possibility of contaminating the water with harmful microbes, since heating the robot enough to truly sterilize it would also destroy its internal systems. ",http://mentalfloss.com/article/69391/why-curiosity-rover-forbidden-collecting-water-mars,"In 2015 NASA announced that they found definitive evidence of liquid water on Mars. But while obtaining a physical sample would revolutionize science, it’s forbidden by international law.

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 prevents every nation on Earth from sending a mission, robot or human, close to a water source in the fear of contaminating it with life from Earth [PDF]. In its 140-million-mile journey from Earth to Mars, it’s possible that Curiosity has carried harmful microbes all the way from home. Even though NASA tries its best to sterilize all space-traveling equipment before launch by subjecting it to intense ultraviolet light, it still might harbor microbial hitchhikers.

In theory, NASA could turn up the heat and radiation to a level pretty much guaranteed to destroy any microbial life—but that could also end up wiping out the rover’s internal systems. ""In order to be completely sterile, they'd have to use really powerful ionizing radiation or heat, both of which would damage the electronics,” University of New South Wales astrobiologist Malcolm Walter told Fairfax Media. ""So they go as far as they dare.""

Another issue that would prevent Curiosity from investigating the water source is the terrain itself. The slopes where the streaks formed are steep and therefore difficult to navigate. Future Mars rovers could be designed with this hurdle in mind, and they could also come equipped with DNA sequencers to test for life or 3D-printing capabilities to build smaller bots with little to no chance of being contaminated.

Unfortunately, it’s too late for NASA modify the next generation of Mars rovers, which is set to launch in 2020. The European Space Agency says it plans to send an organic molecule analyzer on its 2018 ExoMars mission, though they still wouldn’t be able to test Martian water unless they could guarantee 100 percent sterilization.

93,"Osmosis causes the slug to dehydrate. 
Thank you Sam!",http://mentalfloss.com/article/80997/why-does-salt-kill-slugs,"Salt and pepper go together, but salt and slugs don’t pair so well. If you’ve ever battled the slimy gastropods in your garden (or just had a sadistic bent as a kid), you know that a few pinches of salt can kill them. But why? What is it about salt that causes the creepy crawlies to wither?

The answer, in a word, is osmosis: the process that occurs when a solution meets a permeable membrane. A solution is a homogenous mixture of two (or more) substances where one substance, the solute, is dissolved in the other, the solvent. When you have a solution on both sides of a permeable membrane, the solvent tends to pass through the membrane to whichever side has more solute so that concentration on both sides is evened out. That’s osmosis.

A slug has quite a bit of water inside of it, and the cells that make up its skin have highly permeable membranes. When you sprinkle salt on a slug, it mixes with the water in the mucus that the slug secretes to help it move around, creating a salt-water solution. That solution has a higher salt concentration than the inside of the slug, so osmosis occurs and water from the slug’s skin cells passes through the membranes to dilute the solution and even things out. If you use enough salt, the slug will lose so much water that it dehydrates, dies, and winds up looking pretty shriveled.

Humans can handle salt without the same thing happening because our skin isn’t as permeable as a slug’s. Put some salt in your eye, though, and you’ll get a small sense of what the slug is going through.",2016-06-14 11:30:00
94,"Triclosan, which scientists speculate may cause imbalances in gut bacteria. ",http://www.healthiestblog.com/2016/06/ingredient-consumer-products-damage-health.php,"Many consumer products contain this common antimicrobial agent which can have a negative impact on the human health.

Triclosan is a synthetic antimicrobial agent that can upset bacterial communities in the gut, a new study suggests.

Use of triclosan can also lead to ‘superbugs’ which are bacteria that are fully resistant to antimicrobials (e.g. antibiotics).

Triclosan was first introduced in the 1970s in hospital scrub soap and is now found in many consumer products, such as:

toys,

cosmetic products,

deodorants,

toothpastes,

mouth washes,

shampoos,

detergents,

bedding,

kitchen utensils,

cutting boards,

trash bags,

and surgical cleaning treatments.

Triclosan is absorbed through the skin easily and traces can be found in most people’s urine.

Dr Thomas Sharpton, an author of this study said:

“There has been a legacy of concern about exposure to microbial pathogens, which has led to increased use of these antimicrobial products. However, there’s now a growing awareness of the importance of the bacteria in our gut microbiome for human health, and the overuse of antibiotics that can lead to the rise of ‘superbugs’. There are consequences to constantly trying to kill the bacteria in the world around us, aspects we’re just beginning to understand.”

Exposure to triclosan makes changes to the microbial community structure and the diversity of microorganisms.

Also, some bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae are vulnerable and some — such as those in the Pseudomonas family — are resilient to the impact of triclosan.

Scientists believe that these changes can imbalance the bacteria in the gut, which in turn contributes to severe illnesses in humans.

Dr Christopher Gaulke, lead author of the study, said:

“Clearly there may be situations where antibacterial agents are needed. However, scientists now have evidence that intestinal bacteria may have metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune and neurological impacts, and concerns about overuse of these agents are valid. Cumulative impacts are also possible. We need to do significantly more evaluation of their effects, some of which might be dramatic and long lasting.”

The gut microbiome is vital for human health as it improves immune system function, produces micronutrients and stops the growth of pathogens in the body.

Abnormality in the gut microbiome can lead to conditions such as malnutrition, arthritis, diabetes and heart disease.

The study was published in PLOS ONE (Gaulkeet al., 2016).

95,"A diet high in fat. 
Thank you Andy!",http://www.healthiestblog.com/2016/06/diet-starves-brain.php,"Consumption of this diet starves the brain of much-needed glucose, a new study shows.

Consumption of high-fat-content foods causes reduction of glucose levels in the brain, a new study shows.

Three days of a high-fat diet in mice led to a depletion of blood glucose reaching the brain and unbalanced the body.

It took more than four weeks for the brain to restore the sugar uptake at a cost to the rest of the body.

Glucose is the primary fuel and the main source of energy for the brain.

When the brain does not get the fuel, this will affect cognitive skills and memory.

Scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Germany examined the mice’s brains to see how a high-fat diet affects them and how this can lead to diabetes and obesity.

Dr Alexander Jais, the study author, said:

“A high-fat diet reduces the uptake of blood glucose into the brain in as little as three days. So the brain is starving, even though the mice are consuming a lot of calories daily. Responsible for this is the protein GLUT-1, which is the most important glucose transporter at the blood-brain barrier.”

Free saturated fatty acids can have a toxic effect on the blood-brain barrier cells and reduce the GLUT-1 transporter.

The brain has no way to store glucose and some areas of the brain actually lack glucose and they need to get it immediately from the blood stream.

These areas include the cerebral cortex — which are responsible for learning and memory — and hypothalamus which controls the metabolism.

To compensate for the lack of energy, the brain takes action by using macrophages.

Macrophages are particular cells in the immune system and they can produce the growth factor VEGF.

This growth factor is part of the system that restores the oxygen supply to tissues and they can increase the production of GLUT-1.

The research team was able to measure the glucose levels in mice which were on high-fat diet.

They found that the glucose uptake in the brain will still reduce in mice that lack this growth factor.

Dr Jais said:

“As a result of this, the mice learn more slowly and have impaired memory.”

When the diet is high in fat the brain is looking for the sugar and to satiate its need will impact the rest of the body.

Dr Jais explained:

“We call it the selfish brain, because it gets its glucose by stimulating the body’s appetite for sweet foods and in the long run preventing the uptake in muscles and fat. The cells in the musculature are becoming resistant to insulin, the hormone that normally regulates glucose uptake in the cells of these organs. Ultimately, this leads to the development of diabetes.”

The study was published in Cell (Jais et al., 2016).

97,"Statistics show no positive academic effects, and studies show negative health effects. ",http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/homework-could-have-impact-kids-health-should-schools-ban-it/,"Reformers in the Progressive Era (from the 1890s to 1920s) depicted homework as a “sin” that deprived children of their playtime. Many critics voice similar concerns today.

Yet there are many parents who feel that from early on, children need to do homework if they are to succeed in an increasingly competitive academic culture. School administrators and policy makers have also weighed in, proposing various policies on homework.

So, does homework help or hinder kids?

For the last 10 years, my colleagues and I have been investigating international patterns in homework using databases like the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). If we step back from the heated debates about homework and look at how homework is used around the world, we find the highest homework loads are associated with countries that have lower incomes and higher social inequality.

Does Homework Result In Academic Success?

Let’s first look at the global trends on homework.

Undoubtedly, homework is a global phenomenon; students from all 59 countries that participated in the 2007 Trends in Math and Science Study (TIMSS) reported getting homework. Worldwide, only less than 7% of fourth graders said they did no homework.

TIMSS is one of the few data sets that allow us to compare many nations on how much homework is given (and done). And the data show extreme variation.

For example, in some nations, like Algeria, Kuwait and Morocco, more than one in five fourth graders reported high levels of homework. In Japan, less than 3% of students indicated they did more than four hours of homework on a normal school night.

TIMSS data can also help to dispel some common stereotypes. For instance, in East Asia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan – countries that had the top rankings on TIMSS average math achievement – reported rates of heavy homework that were below the international mean.

In the Netherlands, nearly one out of five fourth graders reported doing no homework on an average school night, even though Dutch fourth graders put their country in the top 10 in terms of average math scores in 2007.

Going by TIMSS data, the US is neither “A Nation at Rest” as some have claimed, nor a nation straining under excessive homework load. Fourth and eighth grade US students fall in the middle of the 59 countries in the TIMSS data set, although only 12% of US fourth graders reported high math homework loads compared to an international average of 21%.

So, is homework related to high academic success?

At a national level, the answer is clearly no. Worldwide, homework is not associated with high national levels of academic achievement.

But, the TIMSS can’t be used to determine if homework is actually helping or hurting academic performance overall, it can help us see how much homework students are doing, and what conditions are associated with higher national levels of homework.

We have typically found that the highest homework loads are associated with countries that have lower incomes and higher levels of social inequality – not hallmarks that most countries would want to emulate.

Impact Of Homework On Kids

TIMSS data also show us how even elementary school kids are being burdened with large amounts of homework.

Almost 10% of fourth graders worldwide (one in 10 children) reported spending multiple hours on homework each night. Globally, one in five fourth graders report 30 minutes or more of homework in math three to four times a week.

These reports of large homework loads should worry parents, teachers and policymakers alike.

Empirical studies have linked excessive homework to sleep disruption, indicating a negative relationship between the amount of homework, perceived stress and physical health.

Elementary school kids are dealing with large amounts of homework. Howard County Library System, CC BY-NC-ND

What constitutes excessive amounts of homework varies by age, and may also be affected by cultural or family expectations. Young adolescents in middle school, or teenagers in high school, can study for longer duration than elementary school children.

But for elementary school students, even 30 minutes of homework a night, if combined with other sources of academic stress, can have a negative impact. Researchers in China have linked homework of two or more hours per night with sleep disruption.

Even though some cultures may normalize long periods of studying for elementary age children, there is no evidence to support that this level of homework has clear academic benefits. Also, when parents and children conflict over homework, and strong negative emotions are created, homework can actually have a negative association with academic achievement.

Should There Be “No Homework” Policies?

Administrators and policymakers have not been reluctant to wade into the debates on homework and to formulate policies. France’s president, Francois Hollande, even proposed that homework be banned because it may have inegaliatarian effects.

However, “zero-tolerance” homework policies for schools, or nations, are likely to create as many problems as they solve because of the wide variation of homework effects. Contrary to what Hollande said, research suggests that homework is not a likely source of social class differences in academic achievement.

Homework, in fact, is an important component of education for students in the middle and upper grades of schooling.

Policymakers and researchers should look more closely at the connection between poverty, inequality and higher levels of homework. Rather than seeing homework as a “solution,” policymakers should question what facets of their educational system might impel students, teachers and parents to increase homework loads.

At the classroom level, in setting homework, teachers need to communicate with their peers and with parents to assure that the homework assigned overall for a grade is not burdensome, and that it is indeed having a positive effect.

Perhaps, teachers can opt for a more individualized approach to homework. If teachers are careful in selecting their assignments – weighing the student’s age, family situation and need for skill development – then homework can be tailored in ways that improve the chance of maximum positive impact for any given student.

I strongly suspect that when teachers face conditions such as pressure to meet arbitrary achievement goals, lack of planning time or little autonomy over curriculum, homework becomes an easy option to make up what could not be covered in class.

Whatever the reason, the fact is a significant percentage of elementary school children around the world are struggling with large homework loads. That alone could have long-term negative consequences for their academic success.

However, in a recent talk, the iconic physicist applied his brilliant mind to a more emotional matter.

Hawking gave a poignant message to people suffering from depression, making a poetic comparison between depression and a black hole – no matter how dark they seem, neither are impossible to escape.

Hawking said: “The message of this lecture is that black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought.

“Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up – there's a way out.”

He gave the speech in front of a crowd of over 400 people on Thursday evening, January 7, as part of the Reith lecture at the Royal Institute in London. The lecture was scheduled for November last year, but had to be postponed due to Hawking’s poor health.

Hawking, who turned 74 the day after the lecture, has lived with motor neuron disease for almost 53 years – despite being told he had just two years to live when diagnosed in 1963.

Speaking to the same audience, his daughter Lucy noted Hawking’s incredible mental fitness – both intellectually and emotionally.

“He has a very enviable wish to keep going and the ability to summon all his reserves, all his energy, all his mental focus and press them all into that goal of keeping going,” she said.

“But not just to keep going for the purposes of survival but to transcend this by producing extraordinary work – writing books, giving lectures, inspiring other people with neurodegenerative and other disabilities.”

For those lucky enough to have access to BBC Radio 4 , you’ll be able to listen to the full lecture through two broadcasts on January 26 and February 2 at 9 a.m.

A recent survey asked participants: ""if you were at a restaurant, which critter would make you drop your fork: Rodents, cockroaches, flies, ants, or snakes?"" 61% chose cockroaches. But scientists warn that flies are actually two-times more likely to spread germs - specifically those ubiquitous, hard-to-swat houseflies.

So what's the science behind this? Well, flies eat some of the grossest things imaginable: Poop, garbage, rotting animal carcasses. Another fact about flies is that they can't chew, so in order to eat, they spit-up enzymes onto their food, which dissolves it and lets them slurp it up.

RELATED: Flies Use Fighter Pilot Maneuver to Avoid Swatting

Even though it's probably the grossest thing imaginable, it's actually the bacteria and viruses that get stuck to their body that spreads disease and makes people sick, not their enzymatic spit-up. They only need to touch your food for a second for their legs or the tiny hairs all over their bodies to transfer germs from all those nasty things they eat onto what you're eating. And since flies can transfer serious, contagious diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid, it's probably best if you avoiding eating things that a fly lands on.

Are you the type of person who throws out your food if a fly lands on it? Have you become one after watching this video? Let us know in the comments section below because we'd love to hear from you.

105,"Some researchers claim that because humans are so powerful, yet so sensitive to Earth procceses (like weather), humans were brought by aliens 60k-200k years ago. ",http://www.lifecoachcode.com/2016/04/18/humans-did-not-evolve-on-earth/,"This year, other scientists have argued that life originated on Mars, due to a mineral found in Martian meteorites, thought to be crucial to the genesis of life.

BUT, a new book by American ecologist Dr. Ellis Silver offers arguments, based on human physiology, that humans as species may not have evolved alongside other life on Earth – but arrived from elsewhere, brought here by aliens as recently as a few tens of thousands of years ago.

This is a BIG claim, however, the facts that Silver puts on the table will make you say “how did I not realized this sooner!!”

Silver, an environmentalist who is currently working with the effort to clean plastic debris from the Pacific, says his book aims to provoke debate – and is based on scientific work on the difference between humans and other animals.

“The Earth approximately meets our needs as a species, but perhaps not as strongly as whoever brought us here initially thought,” Silver said in an interview with Yahoo news.

“Mankind is supposedly the most highly developed species on the planet, yet is surprisingly unsuited and ill-equipped for Earth’s environment: harmed by sunlight, a strong dislike for naturally occurring foods, ridiculously high rates of chronic disease, and more,”

Dr. Ellis says that humans might suffer from bad backs because they evolved on a world with lower gravity.

He also says that it is strange that babies’ heads are so large and make it difficult for women to give birth, which can result in fatalities of the mother and infant.

“No other truly native species on this planet has this problem,” he says. Silver also points out to the “extra” 223 genes in human beings, which are not found in any other species, and to the lack of a fossil “missing link”.

“Lizards can sunbathe for as long as they like – and many of them do. We can just about get away with it for a week or two. But day after day in the sun? Forget it. You might as well just lie down on the freeway and wait for a bus to hit you.” We are dazzled by the sun, which is also odd, says Silver – most animals are not.

“We are all chronically ill,” says Silver.

“Indeed, if you can find a single person who is 100% fit and healthy and not suffering from some (perhaps hidden or unstated) condition or disorder (there’s an extensive list in the book) I would be extremely surprised – I have not been able to find anyone.” Silver continues.

It’s like we desperately try to hide the fact that we do not fully belong in this Nature we try to fit in.

We say that we evolved but, if we truly evolved here, shouldn’t we be more in connection with Nature instead of being less and less, to a point that we even harm life around us?

Something just does not seem right.

“I believe that many of our problems stem from the simple fact that our internal body clocks have evolved to expect a 25 hour day (this has been proven by sleep researchers), but the Earth’s day is only 24 hours. This is not a modern condition – the same factors can be traced all the way back through mankind’s history on Earth.”

There is another key element we usually tend to ignore.

Many people say that they don’t feel like they belong on Earth, nor feel at home here, says Dr. Ellis Silver.

And this fact is not something to see as irrelevant, especially not if the majority of the human population feels like this.

“This suggests (to me at least) that mankind may have evolved on a different planet, and we may have been brought here as a highly developed species.” says Silver

What if we migrated here from Mars? And this, believe it or not, is not as farfetched as it seems. Scientists recently discovered that Mars had a strong Magnetic field before it became a wasteland.

Mars is the only planet in our Solar System that has a day of 25 hours, it is further away from The Sun than Earth, it has weaker gravity and it was discovered that Mars had large amounts of water in the past.

What if there was some kind of destruction of global proportions and we had to migrate to save our species?

This would also prove the stories of Humanity being more evolved in the past, but because of an unknown incident we “fell” from “heaven” on earth, and went through a phase of forgetting.

“My thesis proposes that mankind did not evolve from that particular strain of life, but evolved elsewhere and was transported to Earth (as fully evolved Homo sapiens) between 60,000 and 200,000 years ago,” says Dr. Ellis Silver.

106,Some people are genetically better at sports. ,https://www.vox.com/2016/5/30/11767704/practice-doesnt-make-perfect,"I was a horrible lacrosse player in high school: bad at catching the ball, slow, and not very aggressive.

Yet I'd spend hours at a handball wall with my stick: throwing, catching, repeating. I played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games. Freshman and sophomore years, I made it onto the junior varsity team — a miracle.

By 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse. This is when my history teacher — the varsity coach — pulled me aside and suggested I shouldn't bother. I'd probably be cut, he said (adding that I was getting very good grades).

For me, practice did not make perfect. Lo and behold, I now have scientific validation.

A meta-analysis in Perspectives in Psychological Science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn't matter that much.

More precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other.

Even more simply: Some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone. There was a reason I lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field. They probably had a natural advantage on me.

""One important thing — that's easy to misunderstand— is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual,"" Brooke Macnamara, the lead author of the Perspectives paper, tells me. ""So if a person practices, they will get better. Almost across the board, practice should improve one’s performance.""

But it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. ""Essentially, learning rates vary,"" Macnamara says. ""Some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice.""

The analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played. Practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities.

Practice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play. Which suggests ""deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill,"" the study reports. The analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didn't change this figure much either.

So what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent?

Here's where we should note a limitation of studying practice: Researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty.

But Macnamara doesn't think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100.

""There’s probably not one huge contributor that’s accounting for everything else,"" she says.

Instead, there's likely a whole constellation of factors — some of which are genetic or biological in nature — that explain why some people are better athletes than others. They include:

Personality and perseverance

Propensity to get injured

Propensity to choke under pressure

Individual differences in maximum oxygen uptake

Differences in how we acquire muscle mass

Coordination

Height

Enjoyment of competition

""We have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] — different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes,"" she says. ""All of those things are important and interact with each other. Which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance.""

Overall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular ""10,000 hour rule,"" which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it. The research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesn't back that hypothesis up.

On the other hand, it's not like these findings are an excuse not to try.

""Eighteen percent is big,"" Macnamara says. ""We're trying to argue against these ideas that it's so important it accounts for nearly everything."" Practice matters, but it's unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid.

For the athletically un-inclined, like myself, it's a bit of a relief. It's okay if you can't make up the difference with practice, or if you're just a ""slow learner"" when it comes to sports. It's also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing you'll unlikely be the best.

Growing up, my dad was on a quest to find ""my sport"" — the activity I'd finally master. Lacrosse was the closest we came. But it was mostly a parade of failures. Baseball: Throw a ball at me and I'll be more likely to bruise than catch it. Soccer: I was much too slow. Basketball: All of the above. Tennis: I was cut from the middle school team.

I'm not a well-coordinated person, and that's just fine.

These days I stick to activities that don't involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing. I love physical activity. Life's just too short to spend it on activities you're horrible at.",2016-06-01 18:42:39
107,"As smoking rates have decreased, obesity rates have increased. ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/24/one-of-americas-healthiest-trends-has-had-a-pretty-unexpected-side-effect/,"The precipitous fall has offered a glimpse into what happens when a country quits smoking cigarettes. And the answer is a ton of good things. The dip has coincided with steep declines in the rate of lung cancer, the death rate associated with cardiovascular disease (it peaked in 1968) and a number of other negative health outcomes.

Story continues below advertisement

But it has also, interestingly, coincided with another trend that isn't quite as encouraging: the rise of obesity. And it's not unreasonable to think that the two might be at least somewhat related.

""No one would recommend cigarette smoking as a way to combat obesity,"" said Charles Baum, a professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University, and the author of a study published in the journal Review of Economics of the Household. ""But realistically, the decline in smoking might very well have had some effect on the rise of obesity.""

Baum, along with Shin-Yi Chou, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), wondered what, if any, changes in human behavior have played a role in the growing pervasiveness of obesity, which has doubled over the past quarter-century. So they tried to estimate how things beyond the obvious and more immediate shifts in things like diet and exercise might have contributed.

In order to approximate the effect of various socio-environmental factors — things such as changes in food prices, physical demands at work, urban sprawl, racial composition, age distribution and cigarette consumption — Baum and Chou used almost 30 years’ worth of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The survey gathered detailed information about the social and economic backgrounds, weight, height and many other characteristics of more than 12,000 youth. The researchers controlled for several variables, including age, education, income and work experience. And what they found is that nothing seemed to have had much of an effect at all. That is, aside from the changes in cigarette consumption.

""The decline in the prevalence of cigarette smoking didn't have a large effect, comparatively speaking, but it had an effect,"" said Baum. ""It can explain about as much as 4 percent of the increase in obesity, according to our estimates.""

The impact associated with the fall in cigarette consumption was the largest of all the factors the researchers tested — such as the rise of urbanization, the fall in national food stamp enrollment and the growth in the number of restaurants — and that held true in all three of the models they built to compare the various factors.

The cigarette diet

The connection between the national shift away from smoking and growth in the collective American gut isn't as far-fetched as it might seem.

Cigarettes are a well-known appetite suppressant, not just within popular culture, but also among scientists who have studied tobacco's effect on the body. There is a plethora of research that suggests nicotine tends to decrease food intake (including this recent peer-reviewed study, which was published in the journal Science). The reasons, outlined in a slightly older, 1991 study, include resultant changes to the nervous system, physical activity and preferences in food consumption.

And it hasn't just been shown that smoking cigarettes can lead to weight loss — it's fairly well-established that people tend to gain weight after quitting, too.

Story continues below advertisement

""We know smoking cessation leads to weight gain. That's pretty accepted,"" said Yoni Freedhoff, an obesity expert at the University of Ottawa. ""Of course, the amount of weight gain varies, but it can be as high as 12 to 20 pounds.""

The effect is so significant that a study conducted in the early 1990s, which found that ""major weight gain is strongly related to smoking cessation,"" noted that it's likely part of what makes it so hard for people to quit.

So what?

Despite the collective eagerness to pin the obesity epidemic, which now affects more than a third of all U.S. adults, on any one particular thing, the truth is that it's more likely the result of a complex web of many and varied societal shifts. There are things, of course, that contribute more than others — the rise of processed food, for instance, or the uptick in the number of calories Americans consume. But there are also smaller, overlooked factors that slip through the cracks, evading the broader discussion.

The fall of tobacco seems like it might very well be one of those things, as evidenced not only by Baum's study, but also by myriad studies undertaken over the years, which have built on our understanding of the relationship between smoking and weight.

""Obviously, it's hard to establish any causal relationship here, but I would definitely say it's plausible that the fall in smoking contributed to the rise in obesity,"" said Freedhoff, the obesity expert.

What exactly are we supposed to glean from the suggestion that the fall in smoking might have contributed to the rise in obesity? The answer is not that anyone should look back upon the days when more than half of the population smoked regularly with nostalgia. Rather, according to Baum, it's better to view the study's finding as more of a point of interest, a takeaway that allows us to look at how societal changes move like waves that ripple, touching other shifts, even if only slightly.

The fall in smoking ""is an overwhelmingly positive thing,"" he said. ""It's just useful to know what some of the side effects of quitting are. It's interesting to see how they might be contributing to national trends, like the rise in obesity.""",2016-05-30 23:21:02
108,The best age to marry is exactly at 32 to reduce the odds of divorce. ,https://www.fatherly.com/parenting-and-relationships/science-identifies-the-best-age-to-marry-still-debating-when-to-have-kids/,"Data geeks have been responsible for some of our most important discoveries over the past few years, including high-value baseball players, the nation’s best burrito, and now this: The ideal age to get married.

According to new research from The Institute Of Family Studies, it’s 32.

The report swings (and mostly misses) as a bunch of explanations, but states definitively that “prior to age 32 or so, each additional year of age at marriage reduces the odds of divorce by 11 percent. However, after that the odds of divorce increase by 5 percent a year.”

That’s cool if you’re thinking about popping the question, but how does it align with previous research on the best age to have kids?

According to multiple studies summarized in Twentysomething: Why Do Young Adults Seem Stuck? by Robin Marantz Henig and Samantha Henig, it depends on what you mean by “best.” Biologically, prime baby time for women is only ideal if they’re looking for a role on MTV’s Teen Mom. Kids born to 26-year-old moms are statistically least likely to have birth defects, but kids born to 32-year-olds have the lowest overall infant mortality.

If you want to tie the decision to the mother’s long-term physical well being it gets even more complicated — the answer depends on if you’re talking about energy levels, ailments and aches, chronic illnesses, or overall health. To save your calculator thumb, know that the average nets out at 31. But also know that the best age for a woman to give birth, in terms of her overall life expectancy, is 34.

That’s a lot of squishy data to divine a “best” age from, but how about this: Get married around 30 and then have your first kid before 32. Your marriage will last, your kid will have a long, healthy life, and your wife will … have to sacrifice a few years on the back end. Well, “best” is a relative term, isn’t it?",2016-05-29 15:48:43

118,"3 years of cold and rain leading to more marshland that the horses could not traverse, and spoilage of crops leading to less food supplies for the horde which was later exacerbated further by famine. 
Thank you Darko for sending this in!",http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-finally-know-what-stopped-mongol-hordes-from-conquering-europe,"In 1206, Genghis Khan, a fierce tribal chieftain from northern Mongolia, began to take over the world. The khan’s ruthless tactics and loyal horde swept across Asia.

One territory after another fell under the overwhelming force of the Mongol Empire, which would eventually stretch from the eastern shores of China. A series of successful forays in Hungary and Poland made even Europe seem within reach of conquering.

But this unstoppable wave of victories in Europe suddenly ended. Almost as soon as the Mongols set their sights set on Austria, they abruptly returned to Asia.

Historians could only guess why until now, since written accounts from the point of view of Mongol military leaders are sparse. But a new study in the journal Scientific Reports looked at a different kind of record to solve the mystery of the horde’s abrupt exit from central Europe: tree rings.

This wooden chronicle revealed that a cold and wet period set in for years, leading ""to reduced pastureland and decreased mobility, as well as hampering the military effectiveness of the Mongol cavalry"", according to a press release.

Here’s how the Mongols rose to power - and how natural climate change may have forced them to cut their losses and stop a fearsome war of attrition.

Before Hungary

When Genghis Khan died in 1227, he left his son, Ogodei, a territory that extended from northeast China to the Caspian Sea, just north of modern-day Iran. In total, it measured an astounding 11 million square miles (28 million square km).

""Whether measured by the total number of people defeated, the sum of the countries annexed, or by the total area occupied, Genghis Khan conquered more than twice as much as any man in history,"" writes historian Jack Weatherford in his book, Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World.

After Genghis’ death, Ogodei Khan carried forward his father’s legacy. The khanate expanded to the east and west, conquering the remainder of northwest China and pushing into Russia, aided by a wet period that allowed the Mongol armies to bring thousands of horses across the largest desert in Asia: the Gobi.

By 1240, Kiev had been sacked and the horde was rapidly advancing west. Their cavalry and siege tactics were laying waste to the cities of Europe, and, perhaps more importantly, they brought along Chinese gunpowder.

This series of unqualified successes brought the vast Mongol army to Hungary in March 1241. King Bela IV fled his palace in Pest (now Budapest), and Ogodei’s armies slaughtered an estimated 1 million Hungarians: Troops, clerics, nobles, knights, and peasants. It was one of the bloodiest defeats of the medieval period.

In December of 1241, Ogodei Khan died unexpectedly. Some historians have argued that Batu, Ogodei’s nephew who had been leading the western campaign, turned back toward the Mongol capital of Karakorum for the election of a new leader.

But Batu never returned returned to Mongolia, instead remaining in southern Russia to rule the Golden Horde. Meanwhile, Ogodei’s wife, Toregene, took power as the Great Khatun.

An abrupt end

The following year, everything changed. The horde suddenly turned south, moving through modern-day Serbia, and then headed back through Russia. Though subsequent khans staged occasional raids on European cities, the major war campaign was over.

Several hypotheses exist as to why the army abandoned their western front, but, the authors of the new paper argue, none are fully sufficient to explain the change in course.

The authors sampled wood from five regions of Eurasia to track what the weather was like during the period of the Mongols’ most extensive reach.

Sarah Kramer

Trees are especially sensitive to small changes in climactic conditions: in wet years, they add thick layers of bark to their trunks. In dry years, the rings are thinner, reflecting the lack of water to a tree.

They found the climate in Hungary and its surroundings were unusually cold and wet for about three years, from 1238 to 1241. The extra moisture and early spring thaw turned the Hungarian plains into marshes and swampland - unsuitable terrain for moving the thousands of horses the Mongol armies relied on for transportation and warfare.

The last year of the eastern European campaign, 1242, they note, was especially damp. This led to crop spoilage, further reducing the food supply for the khan’s hordes. Famine later set in and killed thousands in the region.

It’s likely that Ogodei’s commanders chose a southern route because of its relatively drier conditions, the authors write, directing them away from Europe.

What happened to the Mongols afterward? Ogodei Khan’s death kicked off a spate of power struggles among Genghis’ sons and grandsons, fracturing the Mongol Empire into pieces that never reunified.

His lineage, however, continued to found dynasties in India, China, Persia, and Siberia. The Mongol people continue to live in China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and modern-day Mongolia, where Genghis Khan’s portrait appears on currency, vodka, and cigarettes, and his name even graces Ulaanbaatar’s international airport.

As scientists gain the ability to examine the climate record in greater detail, we’re discovering more about how climate shaped history. Unusual climates probably allowed Polynesians to spread out across the South Pacific, led to the fall of an ancient metropolis in pre-colonial Mexico, and encouraged Attila the Hun’s campaign of terror against the Roman Empire 800 years before Genghis Khan.

The authors conclude that their study of the Mongolian withdrawal from Hungary, ""illustrates the incidence of even small climate fluctuations upon a historical event"".

It also hints at a lesson for our climate future: a few degrees is all it takes to change the course of human history.

YouTube is a great place to find blooper, snuggly kitten or music videos. Now, it’s also a place to post grand ideas for microgravity research studies. Two of those ideas actually got to fly to the International Space Station. The YouTube Space Lab competition provided just such an opportunity, and three students saw their research performed aboard the orbiting laboratory.

For then-high school students Dorothy Chen and Sara Ma of Troy, Mich. and Amr Mohamed of Alexandria, Egypt, the sky no longer is the limit for their research questions. Chen, Ma and Mohamed completed research investigations as winners of the YouTube Space Lab global contest. The competition invited 14- to 18-year-old students to submit two-minute videos via YouTube to propose physics or biology investigations for astronauts to perform aboard the space station. Their research was chosen out of more than 2,000 entries received from around the world.

The two winning studies looked at the anti-fungal properties of the bacteria Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) in microgravity, and the predatory behavior of Salticus scenicus and Phiddipus johnsoni, also known as a zebra jumping spider and a red-backed jumping spider, respectively. The results they received from their research informed them that microgravity can be a wily participant in a research study held aboard an orbiting laboratory in space.

In a live video stream with the space station, Chen, Ma, Mohamed and NASA astronaut Sunita Williams were interviewed by Bill Nye the Science Guy about the two investigations. “To see it working is just mind-blowing,” said Chen, after talking with Williams on the station about her project. “It’s weird,” remarked Ma, “it’s like we saw the prototype for our bacteria container, and now [Williams] is holding it. It’s just really surreal.”

Chen and Ma hypothesized that B. subtilis, a naturally occurring bacteria commonly used as an anti-fungal agent for agricultural crops, would have increased anti-fungal properties when grown in microgravity compared to the same bacteria produced on Earth. Their testing also added phosphates and nitrates to the B. subtilis nutrient source to see if the additives affected growth and anti-fungal strength. The phosphates and nitrates acted as nutrients to potentially boost growth of the bacteria. The outcome of their investigation aboard the space station showed that the least amount of growth in the bacteria occurred in microgravity as compared to bacteria produced on Earth. They found that microgravity had no effect on the degree to which phosphates and nitrates affect B. subtilis growth.

In reaction to the results of her study with Ma, Chen said, “It was a little difficult to make hypotheses about the reason for the results since we never directly interacted with our experiment, but we think it may have to do with the specific strain of B. subtilis that we used.” For additional study, “I would want to include a control strain,” added Chen.

When asked how the experience of having her research conducted aboard the space station impacted her career goals, Chen said, “It has made me much more curious about the possibilities of research aboard the space station or in microgravity in general.”

Mohamed, now a college student in California, was excited about seeing his zebra jumping spider research in action while talking with Williams in orbit. “The best scientists and astronauts are the ones who work on the station, and it’s an honor to have my own experiment be done there.”

Mohamed's research hypothesized that jumping spiders, like the zebra and red-backed species, would not be able to adapt their hunting abilities to microgravity. Jumping spiders do not build webs for catching their food, instead using their vision to hunt prey, jumping and striking with a fatal bite. This hypothesis was proven wrong while the investigation was conducted aboard the space station, as the spiders did adapt to microgravity to catch prey. “The results did indeed contradict my hypothesis, which was very exciting,” exclaimed Mohamed. “I think it is boring when experiments turn out as expected or when the universe behaves as observed.”

“This competition was by far the best experience of my life. It is something that will stay with me forever,” says Mohamed, when asked how the experience of having his research conducted aboard the space station impacted his career goals. “I am currently studying engineering at my [college] in California. I am involved with the Student Space Flight Initiative. I really want space exploration to be a part of my future.”

In appreciation of the YouTube Space Lab Project, NASA, the American Astronautical Society and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space recognized Zahaan Bharmal of Google for the project as a Top Education Application on the International Space Station in 2012. Bharmal acknowledged the importance of YouTube Space Lab and other space education programs as a key motivator for students to pursue careers in research and engineering and, in turn, further human space exploration. “The first man or woman to one day walk on Mars is, today, a child,"" said Bharmal. ""YouTube Space Lab—and programs like it—are so very important to those on Earth because they are helping to inspire this next generation of explorers who may one day find a new home beyond Earth.”

But spiders crawling into your mouth should be the least of your worries when your far away and dreaming in slumberland.

This young man had to have hundreds of tiny maggots removed from his ear after houseflies invaded and laid their tiny eggs while he was sleeping.

Doctors in India said if they had not treated him, the wriggling larvae - which were feeding off his flesh - could have burrowed into his brain and killed him.

The stomach-churning video was uploaded onto YouTube by Dr Vikram Yadav, who treated the unfortunate man.

They can be seen squirming inside the man's head before Yadav painstakingly removes them with a pair of tweezers.

An infestation of ear maggots is a common problem in the tropics and subtropics - going by the name of aural myasis.

Sufferers usually complain of a buzzing in the ear and a smelly discharge - the fatality rate is 8% according to experts.

It is usually seen in children younger than 10 years of age or in debilitated individuals.

The best way to get rid of the infestation is to ""make them suffocate so they come to the surface"".

As he picks the maggots out manually, Yadav says: ""If anybody sleeps, a child, an old person, and you see any houseflies there, put some cloth on their face so they don’t enter into the orifices and lay their eggs.

By Juan Cole | (Informed Comment) | —

The adoption of wind and solar for electricity generation around the world is happening at a growing pace, and the likelihood is that it will displace hydrocarbons in fifteen to twenty years (decades sooner than Big Coal, Big Oil and Big Gas expect). Here are some stories illustrating that stepped-up pace.

Germany’s wind power output is up by a third in the first five months of 2015 over the same period the previous year. In part, some offshore projects that had been delayed have started coming on line, adding 3 gigawatts of capacity. In part, Germany’s government plans to reduce incentives for wind and has already done so for solar, on the theory that these are now mature industries. The planned changes caused owners of planned wind turbine plants to rush to finish them so as to benefit from the more generous current policies. In 2015, it is expected that for the first time, Germany will generate more electricity via renewables like wind and solar than by its aging set of 8 nuclear reactors. The cost of electricity in Germany is historically low this year as a result of the wind and solar installations in the country, and is half what it is in Britain.

China added 5 gigawatts of new solar capacity in the first three months of 2015! That is nearly equivalent to all the solar installations ever built in Spain. China is going for 17 gigawatts of new solar capacity in 2015. That will make it about tied with Germany, currently the leading solar power in the world, with 33 gigawatts of installed coapacity.

The state of Maharashtra in India has announced a plan to nearly double its power generation from renewables over the next five years, with plans to have 7.5 gigawatts of solar energy and 5 gigawatts of wind by 2020. At the moment, 9% of the state’s energy comes from renewables,and this plan would bring the total to 15%. The plan is revenue-neutral, in part because of expected help from the Indian federal government. Maharashtra lies on the country’s west coast and includes the mega-city of Mumbai (Bombay), its capital. The state has a population of 114 million, making it more populous than the Philippines and nearly as populous as Mexico. That is, if it were an independent country, it would be no. 12 by population. The state’s annual gross domestic product is $233 billion, putting it in the same neighborhood as Iraq, Chile and the Philippines.

Wind power in Brazil doubled in the past year, and solar is up 62%. Brazil is looking to add 6 new gigawatts of electricity generation capacity in 2015.

The United Arab Emirates plans to add 100 megawatts of new solar PV capacity soon. By 2017 the largest solar plant in the Middle East will open, with a capacity of 200 megawatts. By 2021, the UAE plans to get 24% of its electricity from renewables. The UAE is a country of about 9 million, though only about 2 million of those are citizens. It has a GDP of about $400 billion annually, mainly income earned from petroleum exports. But Dubai has emerged as a finance hub and the country is diversifying away from oil. Unlike American CEO’s, the Gulf sheikhs are usually not in any doubt about climate change or the likelihood that the globe will have to give up burning hydrocarbons. The UAE is attempting to position itself as a major player in green energy markets via its Masdar corporation.

Why is all this happening? Because solar power and wind power are competitive with hydrocarbons even if we don’t figure in externalities. Their real price is rapidly falling. Externalities are things like pollution, which economists often do not figure into their formulas for profitability. If we considered externalities, then coal, gas and oil are worthless because they are so destructive. Burning them is like setting off multiple atomic bombs in the atmosphere. But even if you left a little thing like that out of your equations, solar and wind can now compete with other forms of energy in the global marketplace.

For instance, Dubai let a bid for a new solar PV plant that will generate electricity for only 6 cents a kilowatt hour. It would have cost the UAE more than that to build a natural gas plant. We are only at the beginning of a huge electricity price drop.

126,The Sun will collapse when it runs out of fuel (hydrogen) to counteract the immense gravity holding it together. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/physicist-brian-greene-just-explained-to-colbert-how-the-world-will-end,"When we get all caught up thinking about the zombie apocalypse, the robot revolution, or something a little more realistic, like say, an antibiotic-resistant superbug that could seriously wipe millions of us out, we're talking small-time 'end of the world' stuff. Robots might rise up against us and destroy humanity forever, but the world will keep on spinning, and the Solar System will still have eight planets (sorry Pluto).

But nothing is forever, no matter how many billions of years you've existed, and theoretical physicist Brian Greene just demonstrated to Colbert how a star like our Sun will end.

Now, we don't want to alarm you or anything, but at some point, our Sun is going to run out of fuel, collapse in on itself, and everything we know and love will die.

If you have kids, that's something you maybe want to give the delicate 'birds and the bees' treatment to when it comes time to explain that little nugget of truth to them, lest they end up like one of Louis CK's daughters, when he decided to marvel at the incredible, flaming violence of it all:

""She started crying immediately, crying bitter tears for the death of all humanity... and now she knows all of those things: she’s gonna die, everybody she knows is gonna die, they’re gonna be dead for a very long time, and then the Sun’s gonna explode. She learned that all in 12 seconds, at the age of seven.""

The sad futility of existence aside, the science behind how and why a star millions of times more massive than our Sun implodes in on itself is fascinating, and nobody explains it as clearly as Greene in the video above.

And he takes things one step further, by bringing a record-breaking Galilean canon into the studio to demonstrate just how far the shockwaves of destruction will emanate from a dying sun. Dude makes breaking a world record look suspiciously easy.

Watch the video above to find out more about our ultimate demise, and check out this video by Physics Girl if you can't get enough of those stacked balls:

128,Telling great stories. ,http://finance.yahoo.com/news/scientists-men-one-intriguing-characteristic-174500090.html,"man speaking

Take a look at a bunch of women's OkCupid profiles and you'll be hard pressed to find one that says, ""I'm looking for a guy who makes me laugh, loves trying new foods, and — oh! knows how to spin a mean yarn.""

And yet new research suggests that storytelling prowess is a desirable quality in a guy — possibly because it signals that they're high-status. Men, on the other hand, don't seem to be fazed by women's ability to tell a good tale.

Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and SUNY Buffalo came to these conclusions after conducting a series of studies with hundreds of male and female undergrads as participants.

In one study, undergrads read descriptions of men and women, some of which specified that the man or woman tells great stories. Results showed that women found men who were good storytellers more attractive as long-term partners than men who were only decent storytellers, or men whose bios didn't mention storytelling ability at all.

Men, on the other hand, didn't rate women more attractive when those women were described as good storytellers.

The researchers also asked the participants to indicate whether they thought the man or woman would be popular, admired, and a good leader. Answers to these questions indicated how high-status the person seemed.

Sure enough, men who were supposedly good storytellers were perceived by women as higher status. Again, though, women who were supposedly good storytellers were not perceived by men as more attractive or of higher status.

At this point, it's hard to say for sure why women are drawn to men who can tell a good story. The authors suggest that ""storytelling ability reflects a man's ability to gain resources. Good storytellers may be more likely to influence others or to gain positions of authority in society.""

Story continues

Previous research has found that women prefer high-status guys, so this isn't especially surprising — what's new is the idea that storytelling ability is an indicator of status.

Of course, future research is necessary to see if watching and listening to a man tell a story is as appealing as reading a story he's written.

Yet this study adds to a growing body of research on the nonphysical characteristics that can make men attractive to women, like mindfulness and altruism. In some cases, these attributes seem to be even more important than a man's looks.

Bottom line: Women might not explicitly reveal that they're looking for a guy who can tell a good story — in fact, they might not even realize that's what they want. But if you want to impress a woman, consider ditching the pickup lines and starting with ""Once upon a time ..."" instead.

Are his opportunities affected by the status of his home life or gender?

Now this: What happens to the typical woman with a PhD in science after she has her first child? Or her second? How do her (mostly male) peers react? Is she allowed extended maternity leave? Flex time? Breast-pumping breaks and days off for comforting sick kids? Is she considered equally in applications for higher-paying jobs and promotions? What if she takes a year or two off—is the gap on her resume counted as experience, or a strike against her? If she applies for a research grant, will she get it?

Today, February 11, is the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. This is the first such commemorative day dedicated to asking these questions and coming up with solutions to a problem that affects communities from the wealthiest, most urbane settings to the poorest corners of the globe.

In place after place, women and girls are lagging behind their male counterparts in the sciences. A quick look at the stats shows why the international community so urgently needs to do a better job of promoting women in science.

A Global Problem

Worldwide, women account for just 28 percent of all researchers. Even though enrollment numbers are up and more women are studying science, they’re not matching their male counterparts with PhDs and jobs with critical decision-making clout. And we cannot assume the status quo will gradually change over time as more of those women graduate with degrees in science, technology and engineering. “Gaps and barriers persist throughout the scientific research system,” notes a flagship UNESCO science report on this issue titled, Towards 2030.



Even in Europe and the United States, the numbers of women in positions of “leadership and prestige” remain stagnant despite a decade-long push for change. “Each step up the ladder of the scientific research system sees a drop in female participation until, at the highest echelons of scientific research and decision-making, there are very few women left,” the report says. Reasons cited include a host of cultural phenomena: the maternal wall or glass ceiling, lack of recognition and support for women in leadership, and bias—both conscious and subconscious.

The latter is particularly pernicious and difficult to change. “Science remains one of the few sectors where gender bias is common and considered acceptable by some,” according to UNESCO. There is a persistent underlying belief that women simply cannot do science as well as men—or that they are overly emotional and distracting to men.

When women are missing from classrooms and research labs, they are less likely to be invited to research councils, think tanks, and the editorial boards of scholarly journals. They will not move up to political forums and roundtables of global policymaking.

The UN decided to set aside one day—Feb. 11—each year to promote women in science because it is critical to the future of humanity, and this planet. This is not just about do-good, feel-good morality goals; it’s about health and prosperity, life and death. In countries where women and girls are denied education, child and maternal death rates are higher. But when women are educated and included in decision-making circles—in the family, the village, the country—economies grow and mortality rates decline.

Take, for example, climate change. As a whole, women suffer the effects of climate change more than men. “Since men tend to enjoy a higher socio-economic status, women are disproportionately affected by droughts, floods and other extreme weather events and marginalized when it comes to making decisions on recovery and adaptation,” according to UNESCO. Yet not nearly as many women as men work in scientific fields involving climate change adaptation strategies. Not nearly as many women as men have decision-making powers—at home or in the community—to determine the best strategies for family and cultural survival. Participants at last December’s COP21 talks in Paris noted a striking gender imbalance, “detrimental to taking action to save people from the ravages of climate change.”

Think, for a moment, about daily life in a traditionally patriarchal society. Let’s say you’re a girl in a remote village, somewhere up a mountain in Timor-Leste. You quit school at third or fourth grade because your mother needs your help in the kitchen and field. You marry young, leave your parents, and move into your husband’s home. His family pays a bride price for you, and by your culture’s standards, you essentially belong to him. You are “not independent to speak,” says Rosaria Martins da Cruz, director of HIAM Health, an NGO that fights malnutrition among mothers and kids. Your husband doesn’t want you to get a job, so you don’t. You have no income of your own. You spend your days in the confines of your hut and your land—caring for kids, tending livestock, weeding the garden. As a rural woman, you are “always in the home to look after the baby, cooking for the man, clean the house, do everything for the man and the kids,” da Cruz says.

Now let’s say it’s an El Niño year (like this one). The rains are late, and drought is expected. Your crops are dying, and people say it’s going to get worse with climate change. You’ve spent the money from last year’s harvest. There is only a little rice to eat, with a few chiles and greens. You feed your husband first. You feed your baby a mush of bland white rice, nothing else. You eat the last dregs yourself, after the others have finished—because that’s tradition, that’s your place in the family. You know it’s not enough nourishment for any of you. You know you’re all getting weaker. You go to church, you pray for rain. When it doesn’t come, sickness does. The neighbor’s baby dies. Then the old woman up the road does, too. You attend each funeral, and go to bed wishing you had the knowledge to make things better, wishing you knew where to begin. The next morning, you wake before dawn to fetch the water, you light the fire, and your daily routine repeats.

This is what it’s like for millions of rural women worldwide who are neither asked nor granted the opportunity to study, to leave the village, to learn and then return to make things better. When women are excluded from education and the pursuit of dreams, their communities are denied 50 percent of all opportunity to innovate and grow. For many women around the globe, their gender presents a double burden: they are born into the lowest rungs of society, and their culture keeps them there with little chance to advance.

This is something we all must work to change, in our homes and our communities—from Timor-Leste to the United States and beyond. We need Feb. 11 as a start to promote women and girls in science. But even more, we need women and girls in science every day, all year long.

Thank you Pat!",http://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-what-really-happens-to-your-body-when-you-swallow-gum,"You might have heard the rumours as a kid: Swallow gum and it will sit stubbornly in your stomach for seven long years.

But what does science have to say about that? Reactions, a video series from the American Chemical Society, traced the steps taken by our body’s digestive system to find out that while some of the gum we chew can survive digestion, it ""doesn’t mean the gum you swallowed in grade school is still there"". Phew.

Turns out there are three basic components of digestion: The first includes the mechanical processes that are required to process your food when you first ingest it, i.e. chewing.

The second focuses on the enzymes or proteins in your saliva and stomach that help break down that food. Last but not least are acids, which dissolve what’s left into something your body can comfortably pass through your intestines.

Traditionally, when you eat, your teeth and tongue work together to munch the food into small bits. Then your muscle movements push the food through the digestive tract until it is emptied into the stomach and churned with digestive juices, as shown below:

While this is happening, the enzymes in your saliva, stomach juices, and intestines drive chemical processes that allow you to convert that food into nutrients your body can use.

Then, the acids in your stomach get to work, dissolving what’s left of that food into a mush that your body can comfortably pass through your intestines and, eventually… dispose of.

But gum isn’t designed to be smoothly digested by your body like regular food. That’s because it contains either a natural or synthetic rubber base, which is what gives it its gummy consistency. Butyl rubber, commonly used in gum (as well as tires and basketballs, mm!), is a synthetic rubber that provides it with an ideal chewiness.

You’ve probably noticed that gum is unaffected by the crushing of your teeth - that’s kind of the point. So when you swallow the gum, it moves through your digestive tract into your stomach as one giant wad.

While your enzymes are able to break down the carbohydrates, oils, and alcohols in the gum as they would with regular food, the rubber base in the gum is basically immune to these enzymes.

Even the 'harsh brew' of acids in your stomach is no match for this rubber base. (Remember that rubber is so resilient that we use it in gloves for protection.) As a result, part of your gum survives all of your digestive system’s attempts to break it down.

But so do parts of a lot of other things you eat, like sunflower seeds or corn. So while that gum you swallowed is rebellious enough to stand up to your digestive processes, that doesn’t stop your muscles from eventually ushering it through your body and out the other end within a couple days.

",https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/nasa-is-a-jobs-program?utm_term=.dxmG6mPKlV#.xhVavmg3eR,"Although NASA touts its discoveries in space, the federal agency is, and has always been, about jobs on the ground. “Money aimed at science and research ends up with builders and contractors instead,” a former NASA deputy administrator said.

NASA / Via nasa.gov One piece of NASA's massive new rocket

Space adventure fans might enjoy NASA’s latest saga, the story of a rocket to nowhere that Congress wants, very badly, built in Alabama. Or they might be really pissed off. In its 2017 budget request, NASA asked Congress for $1.3 billion to build its next jumbo rocket. Last week, despite years of fighting with the Obama Administration over its plans to explore an asteroid with the rocket, the Senate Appropriations Committee not only granted the request, but gave the space agency an extra $995 million to build it. A surprise billion dollars may sound good. But while adding money to “Space Operations,” the Appropriations Committee also cut $660 million from NASA’s science, aeronautics, and space technology programs that build the telescopes, observatories, planes, and landers that make the agency so beloved. In justifying this decision, the committee wrote that the rocket “is the nation’s launch vehicle that will enable humans to explore space beyond current capabilities.” The futuristic space rocket, called the Space Launch System (SLS), won’t send any astronauts into space until at least 2023, and it doesn’t even have a destination. But that doesn’t seem to matter to lawmakers. Since the moon landings ended, NASA is and has always been a jobs program, more about dollars spent on the ground than discoveries made among the stars, with the SLS bonanza just the latest example. “It is more the politics of pork than the politics of progress,” former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver told BuzzFeed News. “There’s a long-time pattern at NASA where money aimed at science and research ends up with builders and contractors instead.”

NASA / Via nasa.gov Ratana Meekham, a technician at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama

The Senate space spending committee is headed by Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, and on the minority side by Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, both of whom have NASA centers in their states. The SLS (nicknamed the “Senate Launch System” after it was forced on NASA in 2010), will be built at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama, where a $45 million 15-story test stand for the rocket reached its intended height earlier this month. “The point is to spend money and create jobs the way the Soviet Union did on its rocket design bureaus,” Keith Cowing of NASA Watch told BuzzFeed News. The SLS — “a rocket to nowhere,” as Cowing put it — fits this pattern neatly because it provides thousands of jobs in space states. No one knows where it will go. Maybe to an asteroid (the Obama administration’s unloved notion), or to circle the moon, or boost astronauts on their way to Mars. Eric Berger, a reporter at Ars Technica decried the move to build the rocket ahead of a destination. Cuts also came to NASA’s “space technology” funding, a $130 million bite meant to keep aloft earth-observing satellites run out of Goddard Space Flight Center, based in Mikulski’s state of Maryland. As Berger said, “the motivation seems primarily to be keeping people employed.”

One problem with this approach is that you might end up with space rocket that doesn’t have any space technology — a habitat module, deep-space propulsion, landers — to actually let astronauts voyage to asteroids, or the moon, or Mars. You might spend billions on workers who maintain the rocket you’ve built, and not have any money left over to build the interplanetary survival gear needed to ever get to Mars, the ultimate goal of the space agency. It’s happened before, Garver said, with the the $100 billion International Space Station. “We had to spend all the money just to get it built, with very little left for science.” Scientists have long complained how little research takes place on the orbiting lab. NASA’s scientific advisory committee decided only this month to send a fact-finding group to the foundation that manages ISS research, after questioning its scientific productivity.

“The critics are right, this isn’t a rational way to run a space program,” political science professor Harry Lambright of Syracuse University told BuzzFeed News. “But that doesn’t matter, because this is the way a space program will inevitably work in a democracy.” So it has always been for NASA, born in a moment of Cold War lunacy over the Soviet Union claiming the moon for communism, and looking for another space race to justify its budget ever since the glamour of Moon landings first wore off. In the 1960s, NASA administrator James Webb faced declining popular interest in the moon landing, responded by spreading NASA centers to politically important states, such as Lyndon Johnson’s Texas, California, Ohio, and Florida. NASA’s Stennis Space Center, which will build the rocket engines powering the SLS, is located in Mississippi, home to the chairman of the Senate’s overall spending committee, Sen. Thad Cochran. In a sense, that system is still working. NASA built the space shuttle in the 1970s in a decision largely shaped by Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign. Since then, the space agency has had to compete for Congressional dollars like every other federal agency, which means that politicians will always look to jobs as a reason for any Mars landings, Lambright said. “They can’t spend money that Congress doesn’t give them.” So, NASA will at least get a rocket out of the deal, he and others argue. “NASA is actually doing a very good job, in my view, of navigating to build a rocket while they can,"" Lambright said. ""That is what there is money to build."" The real problem, former NASA official Scott Pace of George Washington University told BuzzFeed News, is that the Obama administration’s plans to fly astronauts to an asteroid and then Mars are not very interesting to international or commercial partners, who would rather return to the moon. Building SLS lets NASA keep its options open if the next president decides to look to lunar landings instead, something that Obama seemed to rule out in a 2010 speech. Meanwhile, one commercial partner of NASA appears very much interested in Mars. SpaceX has announced that it will land an unmanned Dragon astronaut capsule on the Red Planet as early as 2018. That landing would depend on its yet-to-be-produced Falcon Heavy rocket, one almost as powerful as the SLS, carrying the capsule to Mars.

Planning to send Dragon to Mars as soon as 2018. Red Dragons will inform overall Mars architecture, details to come

That’s the same SpaceX that on April 8 demonstrated unparalleled rocket landing capabilities, by dropping one of its Falcon rockets onto an ocean barge after sending a satellite into orbit.

Might SpaceX privately building a big rocket in the next two years, and sending something to Mars, make SLS look redundant to politicians, finally ending NASA’s long cycle of rocket-building jobs programs? “That’s kind of optimistic, and I’m an optimist,” said Garver, who served as a space policy advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008. “I wouldn’t count on it.”

Sorry for long post. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/13-amazing-science-facts-you-never-learned-at-high-school,"We learn about some awesome science in high school - like Einstein's theory of relativity, the Periodic table, and DNA replication.

The knowledge we pick up there sets the foundations for all the other amazing things we go on to study. But science definitely doesn't end at high school, and it's once you take your learning to the next level that things get really interesting.

In no particular order, here are some mind-bendingly incredible facts that we didn't learn at high school, but wish we did. Because I certainly would have paid a whole lot more attention if my teacher had shared a few of these insights in class.

Side note: if you did learn about all of this and more at school, then you had a kick-ass teacher and you should probably tell them that.

1. Water can boil and freeze at the same time

Tenstone

Seriously, it's called the 'triple point', and it occurs when the temperature and pressure is just right for the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of a substance to coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. This video shows cyclohexane in a vacuum.

2. Lasers can get trapped in a waterfall

BuzzFeedYellow

Oh my gosh, yes. Not only is this an incredible example of total internal reflection, it also shows how fibre optic cables work to guide the flow of light.

3. We've got spacecraft hurtling towards the edge of our Solar System really, really fast

Clay Bavor/Twitter

We all know rockets are fast, and space is big. But sometimes when we're talking about how long it takes for us to get to distant parts of the Solar System (eight months to get to Mars, are you kidding me?) it can feel like our spacecraft are just crawling along out there.

This gif shows just how wrong that idea is by comparing the speed of the New Horizons probe, which flew past Pluto last year, to a 747 and SR-71 Blackbird.

4. An egg looks like a crazy jellyfish underwater

BIOSstation/YouTube

A cracked egg on land might make a big mess, but 18 metres (60 feet) below the surface of the ocean, the pressure on the egg is 2.8 times atmospheric pressure, and it holds it all together like an invisible egg shell. True story.

5. You can prove Pythagoras' theorem with fluid

00000000130/YouTube

Not buying what your maths teacher is selling when they tell you a2 + b2 = c2? You can actually prove it with liquid.

6. This is what happens when a black hole swallows a star

NASA

As the star gets sucked up into the black hole, a huge jet of plasma is burped out, spanning hundreds of light-years. ""When the star is ripped apart by the gravitational forces of the black hole, some part of the star's remains falls into the black hole, while the rest is ejected at high speeds,"" explains Johns Hopkins University researcher, Suvi Gezari.

7. You CAN see without your glasses

MinutePhysics

According to MinutePhysics, all you need to do is make a pinhole with your hand, which will help you focus the light coming into your retina. Sure, it won't give you 20/20 vision, but it's a good start if you've left your glasses at home.

8. This is how a face forms in the womb

BBC

Embryonic development is an incredibly complex process that scientists are still just beginning to understand. But one thing researchers have been able to map out is how the embryo folds to create the structures of the human face in the womb. We could watch this all day.

9. Popping your knuckles isn't necessarily bad for you

Vox

One researcher popped the knuckles of one hand for 60 years but not the other, and found no discernible difference in the amount of arthritis between the two of them at the end of his experiment.

Find out more in this video from Vox:

12. You'd be better off surviving a grenade on land rather than underwater

Mark Rober

Those balloons? That's what would happen to your lungs if an explosion went off near you underwater.

13. If you spin a ball as you drop it, it flies

Veritasium

I mean, it really flies. It's thanks to the Magnus effect, which occurs when the air on the front side of a spinning object is going the same direction as its spin, which means it gets dragged along with the object and deflected back.

Meanwhile, the air on the other side of the ball is moving in the opposite direction, so the air flow separates.

Watch Veritasium explain it better than we ever could:

We could keep going... but the best part about science is that it discovers new things every day. Never stop learning.

“Thai food is delicious but sometimes very greasy,” BBDO writes in a project description, adding that the hundreds of stir-fry and deep fried dishes cooked with oil are one of the reasons that Thais have the second highest obesity rate in Southeast Asia. “Unhealthy eating behaviour is hard to change, and most Thai people go for what’s delicious. How can we help Thai people eat healthier without changing their regular meal?”

But 30 calories per meal is such a negligible amount that this is certainly not a silver bullet.

The inhabitants of the Movile Cave are like no others. The “otherworldly” conditions of this Romanian cave, just a few miles west from the Black Sea, have been sealed up for around 5.5 million years. Although the air is poisonous and unbearably humid, this cocktail of factors has created a goldmine for biologists.

Fewer than 100 people have ever delved into the cave, according to BBC Earth . It was only discovered by humans in 1986, when workers of the Socialist Republic of Romania were looking for new ground to build a nuclear power plant. Nowadays, it is blocked off by the authorities and only accessible with special permission, although the central caverns are naturally “guarded” by a series of vertical shafts and narrow limestone tunnels.

Once in the depths of the cave, the air contains half of the amount of oxygen than usual and is high in carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. It is also pitch black and hasn’t seen sunlight for at least 5.5 million years.

148,"1.Understand and build language
2.Recognise and exploit hidden structures in data.
",http://www.sciencealert.com/what-makes-a-mathematical-genius,"The film The Man Who Knew Infinity tells the gripping story of Srinivasa Ramanujan, an exceptionally talented, self-taught Indian mathematician. While in India, he was able to develop his own ideas on summing geometric and arithmetic series without any formal training.

Eventually, his raw talent was recognised and he got a post at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked with G.H. Hardy until his untimely death at the age of 32 in 1920. Despite his short life, Ramanujan made substantial contributions to number theory, elliptic functions, infinite series, and continued fractions.

The story seems to suggest that mathematical ability is something at least partly innate. But what does the evidence say?

From language to spatial thinking

There are many different theories about what mathematical ability is. One is that it is closely tied to the capacity for understanding and building language. Just over a decade ago, a study examined members of an Amazonian tribe whose counting system comprised words only for 'one', 'two' and 'many'.

The researchers found that the tribe were exceptionally poor at performing numerical thinking with quantities greater than three. They argued this suggests language is a prerequisite for mathematical ability.

But does that mean that a mathematical genius should be better at language than the average person? There is some evidence for this. In 2007, researchers scanned the brains of 25 adult students while they were solving multiplication problems.

The study found that individuals with higher mathematical competence appeared to rely more strongly on language-mediated processes, associated with brain circuits in the parietal lobe.

Srinivasa Ramanujan. wikimedia

However, recent findings have challenged this. One study looked at the brain scans of participants, including professional mathematicians, while they evaluated mathematical and non-mathematical statements.

They found that instead of the left hemisphere regions of the brain typically involved during language processing and verbal semantics, high-level mathematical reasoning was linked with activation of a bilateral network of brain circuits associated with processing numbers and space.

In fact, the brain activation in professional mathematicians in particular showed minimal use of language areas. The researchers argue their results support previous studies that have found that knowledge of numbers and space during early childhood can predict mathematical achievement.

For example, a recent study of 77 eight-to-10-year-old children demonstrates that visuo-spatial skills (the capacity to identify visual and spatial relationships among objects) have an important role in mathematical achievement.

As part of the study, they took part in a 'number line estimation task', in which they had to position a series of numbers at appropriate places on a line where only the start and end numbers of a scale (such as 0 and 10) were given.

The study also looked at the children’s overall mathematical ability, visuospatial skills, and visuomotor integration (for example, copying increasingly complex images using pencil and paper). It found that children’s scores on visuospatial skill and visuomotor integration strongly predicted how well they would do on number line estimation and mathematics.

Hidden structures and genes

An alternative definition of mathematical ability is that it represents the capacity to recognise and exploit hidden structures in data. This may account for an observed overlap between mathematical and musical ability. Similarly, it could also explain why training in chess can benefit children’s ability to solve mathematical problems.

Albert Einstein famously claimed that images, feelings and musical structures formed the basis of his reasoning rather than logical symbols or mathematical equations.

Albert Einstein playing the violin. E. O. Hoppe

However, the extent to which mathematical ability relies on innate or environmental factors remains controversial. A recent large-scale twin and genome-wide analysis of 12-year-old children found that genetics could explain around half of the observed correlation between mathematical and reading ability.

Although this is quite substantial, it still means that the learning environment has an important role to play.

So what does all this tell us about geniuses like Ramanujan? If mathematical ability does stem from a core non-linguistic capacity to reason with spatial and numerical representation, this can help explain how a prodigious talent could blossom in the absence of training.

While language might still play a role, the nature of the numerical representations being manipulated could be crucial.

The fact that genetics seems to be involved also helps shed light on the case – Ramanujan could have simply inherited the ability. Nevertheless, we should not forget the important contribution of environment and education.

While Ramanujan’s raw talent was sufficient to attract attention to his remarkable ability, it was the later provision of more formal mathematical training in India and England that allowed him to reach his full potential.

She was born in 2004 and her first 14 months of life were spent in an orphanage in China.

I am well acquainted with the vast body of research that shows the physical and psychological harms of deprived environments. Orphanages can arguably be placed under this category along with other places such as refugee camps and some hospitals where children lack close contact and attention. Deprivation comes in many shapes and forms: lack of food, diseases, maltreatment, and child abuse are some of the harms that come to mind. However, I would argue that deprivation of love can be just as deadly.

When I started researching orphanages and child health I read the classic works of paediatrician Harry Bakwin, psychologist John Bowlby and psychiatrist Harry Edelston. At the beginning of the 20th century, in the US and the UK, the death rates among infants placed in orphanages, nurseries, and foundling hospitals were, in some cases, close to 100%. London’s Foundling Museum documents in depth these harsh realities. In the 1940s, the work of psychoanalyst Rene Spitz further documented high infant death rates (one out of three) and, among the babies who didn’t die, high percentages of cognitive, behavioural and psychological disfunction.

Most of these deaths were not due to starvation or disease, but to severe emotional and sensorial deprivation – in other words, a lack of love. These babies were fed and medically treated, but they were absolutely deprived of important stimulation, especially touch and affection.

The importance of touch

Human touch is fundamental for human development and survival. Research conducted by Ruth Feldman and Tiffany Field has shown the positive effects that come from skin-to-skin touch in premature babies and that these effects are still at work after ten years. Significant gains in neurological development, weight gain, and mental development of premature babies have been shown to be triggered by skin-to-skin stimulation.

Infants in orphanages can be deprived of touch, individual attention, and love. This happens not because all orphanages are terrible places (although some of them are), but because there are usually too many babies for the staff to manage. In the case of the hospitals, in Europe and the US in the first half of the 20th century, nurses were required to cover their faces with surgical masks and not interact with babies. Parents and other family members were prevented from visiting freely as it was believed this would prevent infections from spreading and help keep babies healthy. However, instead of getting better the babies got worse.

Bakwin understood that this was harmful to the children’s well-being. He stated that “failure of infants to thrive in institutions is due to emotional deprivation"". The term “failure to thrive” is currently used as an umbrella term of conditions, ranging from growth delay, emotional misery and death. It is a generalised health problem seen in high-income and low-income countries although it is more prevalent when poverty and a lack of human resources prevents the babies from receiving emotional and sensorial stimulation (or love) on a daily basis.

My daughter’s story

The reports from our adoption agency guaranteed that the children were well taken care of, fed appropriately, and had toys to play with. But how much sensory stimulation were they given? We knew that the babies were trained, from very early, to hold their feeding bottle on their own. It was not possible to have a carer per child during feeding times.

We flew to China and adoption day finally arrived. Our daughter seemed to be in good health. She adapted herself to us quickly, clearly enjoying the attention we provided, and ate everything we offered. However, on the day we held her for the first time, 90% of the baby girls her age were taller than her. The effects of short height at this age can linger for life and are usually associated with poor health in later life, such as a greater risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease.

Once we got her back home, we were certain that love and bonding would be what she needed most. Three months later, 75% of girls her age were taller than her. Today, at 11 years of age, only 50% of girls her age are taller than her. This is consistent with research that shows a catch-up growth for children who were in orphanages and internationally adopted.

When emotional deprivation and lack of love occur, physical growth slows down or stops. The body enters into a survival mode where vital, basic physiological functions are preserved at the cost of physical, mental, and social development. The longer the child is in survival mode, the more permanent and negative the effects will be. Once a child is adopted and the amount of love, care, and stimulation increases, the body ceases to be in survival mode and will start recuperating.

My husband and I study anthropometry, the study of human body measurements, providing accurate biomedical information on health and nutritional status. We measure our daughter twice a year and compare the results with the World Health Organisation references. But we do not obsess over her measurements. She is a very healthy child, doing well at school in academic subjects, sports, and music. We are now happily bracing for adolescence.

Our daughter’s experience mirrors that of thousands of other babies adopted into loving, well-off families. Increasing awareness on this issue is a step in the right direction, so that more orphaned children receive the happy ending my daughter did.

Well, this video by EatsTooMuchJam shows what happens when you sling a frisbee made out of 0.45 kilograms (1 pound) of sodium into a river.

152,Could be bad for your health. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/why-you-shouldn-t-wrap-your-food-aluminum-foil-cooking-it,"If you’re baking fish, roasting vegetables or preparing a piece of meat for dinner tonight, chances are that you’ll wrap your food in aluminium foil. What you may not realise is that some of the foil will leach into your meal – and this could be bad for your health.

Research that I conducted with a group of colleagues has explored the use of aluminium for cooking and preparing food. Aluminium doesn’t just appear in foil: it is the most popular cookware material used by people in developing countries. Pots and pans are lined with it and it is found in some kitchen utensils like large serving spoons. Copper used to fulfil this role, but over time it’s been replaced by aluminium because it is cheaper to mass produce and easier to clean.

But while cooking your food in aluminium pots or pans isn’t a bad thing, placing it in foil and putting it in the oven is problematic. This is especially true with acidic or spicy food that’s prepared at high temperatures.

Aluminium and health

Human bodies can excrete small amounts of aluminium very efficiently. This means that minimal exposure to aluminium is not a problem: the World Health Organisation has established a safe daily intake of 40mg per kilogram of body weight per day. So for a person who weighs 60kg the allowable intake would be 2400 mg.",2016-05-21 21:30:00
153,Genes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/why-your-nose-looks-it-does,"Whether you’ve got a button nose, a hook nose, or a Roman nose, you can blame a specific group of five genes for the shape of your honker, according to a new study that appears in the journal Nature Communications.

When it comes to appearances, humans are probably the most diverse species on the planet, coming in all shapes and sizes. This goes as much for our faces as our bodies, and of course one of the most prominent items on the facial landscape is the schnoz.

Differences in nasal design are thought to be driven by a number of evolutionary adaptations, such as the need for nostrils of a particular size in order to control the volume and temperature of inhaled air. The fact that humans tend to recognize each other by sight rather than smell (in most cases!) is another key driver of our wildly varying facey bits.

Surprisingly, these enormous differences in nose shape and size are controlled by a rather small number of genes, which, according to the study authors, encode for specific characteristics such as nostril width, “pointiness,” and the inclination of the bridge of the nose.

To discover this, the researchers looked at photographs of 6,275 people from across Latin America, cross-referencing these images with a full analysis of their genomes, obtained via a DNA sample. In particular, the study authors analyzed 14 different facial traits, seeking out any genetic similarities between people with similar features.

Amazingly, the researchers were able to pinpoint five genes that seem to code for specific nasal traits. For instance, a gene called DCHS2 – which plays a role in controlling cartilage formation – was found to have a major influence over the pointiness of a person’s nose. Another gene, called PAX1, was identified as a driver of nostril breadth, while RUNX2, which is involved in bone growth, is vital for nose bridge width.

This knowledge could have major implications for the treatment of inherited facial deformations. Conditions such as Campomelic Dysplasia, for instance, are associated with a range of craniofacial defects, and are thought to be caused by mutations in genes controlling the development of cartilage.",2016-05-21 18:30:00

But according new research from Vanderbilt University, it's better to get real about gaps in your résumé—and being honest could actually land you the job.

""Our study provides the first-ever evidence that women who conceal personal information dramatically lower their hiring prospects,"" says Joni Hersch, professor of law and economics at Vanderbilt Law School, about women who take time away from their careers to raise kids. In other words, being forthright about stepping away from work in favor of family actually works—refreshingly—in women's favor.

I was shocked by the results,"" says Hersch.

Hersch and assistant professor Jennifer Bennet Shinall had 3,022 subjects act as potential employers and asked them to choose between two female job candidates. Each résumé had a 10-year gap in job history. A personal explanation—taking time off to have a child or a get through a divorce—was given for some of the candidates. No explanation was given on the other résumés.

The job-searchers who gave the personal info had a 30-to-40 percent increased chance of being hired, according to the findings.

""I was shocked by the results,"" says Hersch. ""The personal information gave no indication whether the woman would be a more or less productive employee. This was entirely neutral information. Yet the number of people who preferred the woman who explained her résumé gap was staggering.""

155,"When the bears switch to a leafy, less fibrous diet, they slough off the lining of their gastrointestinal tract ",http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/what-are-there-gooey-masses-panda-poop,"An analysis of giant panda poop has revealed that when the bears switch to a leafy, less fibrous diet, they slough off the lining of their gastrointestinal tract. It then passes through their digestive system and comes out as a gooey mass. The findings, published in Frontiers in Microbiology this month, may help explain why these endangered animals are struggling to reproduce.

Recent work revealed that the digestive systems of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) resemble that of carnivores and omnivorous bears – even though their transition to a vegetarian diet happened some 2 million years ago. Their gut and gut microbes are built for breaking down meat and small amounts of plant matter, yet pandas eat up to a third of their body weight in bamboo every day.

A team led by Garret Suen from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ashli Brown of Mississippi State studied two giant pandas living at the Memphis Zoological Society in Tennessee: a female named YaYa and a male named LeLe (pictured above). The team observed the pandas’ bamboo consumption behavior, and they collected fresh feces (pictured to the right) as well as samples of mucous excretion.

Pandas undergo dramatic seasonal shifts in diet: Most of the time, they eat bamboo stalks, but in August and September, they shift to leaves. Shortly after this summertime shift from woody stalks to less fibrous leaves, the pandas experience episodes of gastrointestinal tract distress, with symptoms ranging from abdominal pain to the excretion of mucous stools containing gelatinous pellets called mucoids. And the pandas stop eating.

After sequencing DNA extracted from stool samples, the team found that microbial diversity is lower in samples collected immediately before mucoid episodes than in the mucoids. Additionally, mucoids contain microbes that are typically found in the gut lining. Together, these findings suggest that mucoids are the expulsion of the internal mucus lining driven by changes in diet.

“What we think might be happening is that their diet is causing a strong internal reaction, leading to an inflammatory response,” Suen explained in a statement. “Pandas are basically shedding their gastrointestinal lining to allow for the replacement of those microbes. It’s kind of like resetting the microbiome.”

The researchers aren’t sure why pandas experience this resetting, and furthermore, this summer shift in food – and the sickness that follows – coincides with the beginning of panda pregnancies. Mucoids are more prevalent following breeding season, and the reduction in nutrition may affect gestation, lactation, and cub development.

156,Ecuador's Chimborazo is the tallest. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/everest-may-not-be-tallest-mountain-world-after-all,"Here’s an easy question for you: What’s the tallest mountain in the world? If you are wary of being asked such a seemingly simple query, you would be right to be concerned, because the answer is not necessarily Mount Everest.

At a height of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level, it puts other mountains on Earth to shame. However, if you measure this distance out from the center of Earth, thanks to elevated crust near the equator, Ecuador’s Chimborazo is by far the “tallest.”

Measured above sea level, it is only 6,268 meters (20,564 feet) high; when taken from Earth’s core, it is actually 2,168 meters (7,113 feet) higher than Everest would be by this metric. This means that although Everest may be the highest peak on Earth, Chimborazo may in fact be the most prominent – meaning that it “sticks out” more than anything else.

Then there’s the issue of Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on the island of Hawaii. At 4,207 meters (13,803 feet) above sea level, it doesn’t come close to either Everest of Chimborazo using this traditional metric. If the water around it is removed, however, then the height of this once angry mountain is actually around 9,330 meters (30,610 feet). Side by side, Mauna Kea trounces Everest.

The reason this old volcano is so high is because it is sitting on oceanic crust, which is denser than the continental crust that Everest has emerged out of. This means that, even with a massive chunk of rock sitting on top of it, the former cannot be compacted as much as the latter. Ultimately, oceanic crust can support the weight of higher mountains than the continental crust ever could.

In any case, this all pales in comparison to the depths of the deepest point in the ocean. The Challenger Deep, found south of the Japanese archipelago, is 10,984 meters (36,036 feet) below the surface of the ocean. At this depth, it is 2,136 meters (7,000 feet) deeper than Mount Everest is tall.

But why stop at looking at Earth’s features? Thanks to a now-extinguished stationary superheated mantle plume beneath the crust, the Olympus Mons shield volcano on Mars spent millennia piling lava flow after lava flow on top of itself. Nowadays, the extinct edifice is 21,229 meters (69,649 feet) high, which is roughly 2.4 times the height of Everest.

Speaking of volcanoes, Io – the most volcanically active object ever discovered – is currently orbiting Jupiter and spewing out some unbelievably high plumes of sulfurous material. Thanks to explosive volcanic activity at the surface, a nearly non-existent atmosphere providing almost zero resistance, and a low gravitational field strength, some of these plumes can reach heights of 500 kilometers (311 miles).

These gloriously gargantuan columns of volcanic material, some of which have been observed in real-time as they begin to freeze into frigid crystals in space, can fit around 57 Mount Everests inside them. To the Solar System, Everest is a mere molehill.",2016-05-20 06:30:00
157,It has a moon. ,https://secondnexus.com/technology-and-innovation/makemakes-moon/,"The dwarf planet Makemake, discovered in 2005, is cold, dark and remote. It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon.

Finding a Dark Moon

Until this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake’s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake’s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake’s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The “dark moon hypothesis” offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. “Imagine that the dark material isn’t on Makemake’s surface… it’s in orbit!” image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. “If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!”

Credit: Source.

Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake’s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden.

MK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don’t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker’s words, “not actually that faint”), but it was easy to miss before.

Part of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake’s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he

thought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, “Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?” When Buie replied, “There’s a moon in the Makemake data?” they knew they’d made a major discovery.

The Moon in the Data

It is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2’s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake’s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place.

However, MK2’s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake’s past atmosphere. If MK2’s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, “The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.” If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts.

The New, Improved Makemake System

While MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, ""The discovery of this moon has given us an

opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.""

Makemake is sometimes referred to as “Pluto’s little sister” because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. “That's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,” Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake.

Looking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system’s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech’s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, “The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. But we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story.” Small worlds like Makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more “exotic” ices and compounds. Since MK2 will allow scientists to tell Makemake’s density and thus the densities of the materials it’s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets.

The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. Even before then, though, information about Makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new Hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. “This new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system,” Buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us.",2016-05-20 01:54:06
158,New Orleans is sinking faster than previously thought. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/some-regions-new-orleans-found-be-sinking-five-centimeters-year,"It was already known the region is sinking, but now NASA has revealed it is happening at higher rate than previously thought. NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri

NASA has confirmed that New Orleans and the surrounding areas are sinking at a much higher rate than previously thought. Using airborne radar to map the rate at which the ground is sinking over a period of a few years, they were able to document in fine detail exactly which regions are most at risk, and where planning and building needs to be monitored.

The Earth’s surface can sink due to a mixture of natural and man-made causes. The weight of deposited sediment can, for example, cause subsidence, as can the movement of glaciers and the compaction of shallow sediments. But humans can also influence this process by pumping out oil and gas, or in the example of New Orleans, by the withdrawal of water.

The extraction of groundwater and dewatering of the region, in which surface water is removed in order to prevent standing water or saturated earth, is causing the city to sink. This has been exasperated by the building of levees, which prevent the natural build-up of sediment that counteract the sinking.

The region of Norco is one of the worst affected, sinking 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri

This is most acute in regions upriver along the Mississippi River, specifically the industrial areas of Norco and Michoud, where the ground is sinking by a worrying 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. Other areas of concern were in New Orleans Upper and Lower 9th Ward, where the subsidence may be related to the water levels of the Mississippi. Of particular concern is the changes in ground level around the levees built to prevent flooding, as they found regions behind the levees sinking by 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) a year.

The data used by NASA to build the maps, published in a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was created using NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), which is able to track changes in elevation on the Earth’s surface down to a centimeter difference. This by itself can’t tell the researchers what is causing the change in ground level, so they then have to disentangle all the possible causes, which operate at different time and space scales.

While the fact that the region is sinking is not new, NASA have highlighted that the degree to which it is happening is much greater than previously thought, and that it could be putting certain regions at a much greater risk of flooding, as if there wasn’t a big enough one to begin with. It is hoped that the data can be used to attempt to reduce or reverse the subsidence in the most severely affected areas, as well as help with planning decisions for the future.",2016-05-19 21:30:00

160,Atmospheric Mirrors caused by Solar Flares. ,http://www.iflscience.com/physics/scientists-finally-solve-50-year-old-mystery-atmospheric-echoes,"Scientists always love a thoroughly mysterious signal. Although one has never been traced back to alien life, terrific planet-wide thunderstorms on alien worlds far from our own have generated detectable radio bursts. Other such signals have been emitted from the heart of our own galaxy, perhaps due to the destruction of dark matter.

A new study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters has claimed to solve the enigma of another of these signals. The so-called “150-kilometer echoes” have been baffling scientists for half a century, but it turns out that every single person on the planet has been looking at the culprit their whole lives.

Every single day at dawn and dusk, the phenomenon rears its head: Radar signals, initially being sent into space by scientists, have been reflecting back towards the ground as echoes. Something at a height of 150 kilometers (90 miles) is acting as a mirror for these signals, and towards noon, the “depth” of the mirror extends downwards to a height of 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 19 miles).

The mirror then rises again towards sunset, where it disappears at night. Probes sent into the atmosphere during sunrise and sunset have failed to identify any potential source of the mirroring effect.

Researchers at Boston University decided to try and identify this mirror once and for all. “When you actually figure out something that nobody’s ever figured out before, that’s when it’s really worthwhile,” Meers Oppenheim, an astronomer at Boston University and joint co-author of the study, said in a statement.

The echoes, tracked throughout the day, at varying altitudes. Oppenheim and Dimant/Jorge Chau/GRL

They noted that the source of the echoes grew more powerful during solar flares and became considerably weaker during eclipses. The researchers also pointed out that the increasing depth of the signal during the day matched the angle of incoming solar radiation. This circumstantial evidence seemed to point to our local star as being potentially culpable, but the signal was unlikely to be coming from the Sun itself.

Ultraviolet light from the Sun is known to tear off the electrons of oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the upper atmosphere, which sends these electrons off at high speeds and with considerable energies. The interactions between these electrons, the electron-stripped molecules (ions) and other particles, are likely to cause the ions to vibrate in batches.

As the study suggests, this mass vibration could generate energetic waves that may be strong enough to reflect radar signals coming from the ground. Using computer simulations to replicate this mechanism, the researchers did indeed show that the energy from the incoming solar radiation is enough to ultimately produce radar-reflecting batches of vibrating ions.

As the Sun rises and moves across the sky during the day, the angle of incoming solar radiation increases, and the vibrating ion batches appear lower in the sky. Towards sunset, the angle decreases, and the “mirror” moves back upwards again. During energetic solar flares, more vibrating ions can be produced, and the mirror becomes more powerful.

Far from just solving a long-held mystery, the team note that this atmospheric mirror, which is easily located, can be used to track the complex movements of atmospheric currents and tides. In any case, this once-mysterious signal is definitely not coming from an alien civilization; perhaps more importantly, it’s not just coming from someone using their microwave at the wrong time of day.",2016-05-19 10:30:00
161,Not Yet. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/can-paedophilia-really-be-cured-drugs,"According to the Daily Mail, scientists in Sweden are working on a “cure” for paedophilia. The trial involves a drug that disrupts testosterone.

Forcing or persuading children to have sex is one of the worst things a person can do to them. Sexual abuse causes serious emotional and physical harm, and can ruin a child’s capacity to have healthy relationships as an adult. However, we mustn’t confuse all sexual abuse of children with paedophilia.

Paedophiles are sexually attracted to children but they may, or may not, act on their urges. In fact, my experience indicates that most of the people who abuse children are not paedophiles. Research by Alanko and colleagues, looking at the question of whether paedophilia was inherited, showed that approximately 5% of men in the study with paedophilia had offended against children. In fact, people who offend against children, in my experience, are (mostly) men who are obsessed with sex and are looking for a sexual outlet, regardless of the age of the victim.

In our research which looked at whether medication was helpful for sexual offenders who struggled with their obsession with sex, we found that while over 90% of them had committed offences against children, most of them had also abused adults. And, in some cases, victims included both males and females, showing a broad pattern of offending. These abusers will seek out any possible opportunity for sexual satisfaction and sadly children are often vulnerable and easy prey.

Clinicians use the following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria to diagnose paedophilia:

Over a period of at least six months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviours involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger). The person has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. The person is at least age 16 years and at least five years older than the child or children in Criterion A.

Most paedophiles don’t act on their urges

Many researchers think that paedophilia is a sexual orientation (like heterosexuality), rather than a psychosexual disorder or illness. Regardless of which it is, it’s very difficult for people to live with. Discovering at puberty that your sexual preference is for children, is usually a terrifying and depressing realisation.

Think back to when you were 13 or 14 years old and just beginning to become strangely drawn to the boys or girls around you. Now think what it would have been like if those feelings were not for your own peer group, but for much younger children. You might wonder or worry a bit at first, and, as time went on, worry a lot. Why are you so different? What is wrong with you? Who can you talk to about it?

It’s tough enough for teenagers to talk to their parents about sex, let alone tell them they are a paedophile. What we need to do, as a society, is to understand that some people are sexually attracted to children. More than this, we also need to understand that this attraction to children does not bring with it an uncontrollable urge to force sexual attention on children.

Or course, there will be a small number of people who either can’t or won’t control their sexual urges, but for the most part, they can and they will. Think of yourself in a similar situation with your preferred partner type. How easy do you find it to control yourself in a roomful of the type of people you are attracted to? It’s not so difficult to do, is it?

Medication to manage sexual arousal

But what about paedophiles who do act on their urges (as well as sex offenders who prey on children) – do the drugs work for them? As the researcher leading the evaluation of the use of these types of drugs in the UK prison service, I can reassure you that they do reduce people’s obsession with sex.

The drugs seem to work well and it is great that they are being offered (in this case) as a prevention tool. It’s also important that they are offered alongside psychological treatment to further help people control their urges.

As of April 1, 2016, both medication and psychological treatment are also being offered in the UK across the whole of the prison service, and some charities, such as the Safer Living Foundation, are also looking to offer them as a prevention tool for people who have not yet committed an offence.

Keeping children safe

Although testosterone disrupting drugs can help sex offenders control their urges, they may not be a cure for paedophilia. As already described, most people who offend against children are not paedophiles.

Most paedophiles are perfectly capable of controlling themselves and understand the damage that will be done to children by sexual abuse. We need to stop panicking about paedophiles, and focus our efforts on offering treatment and help to anyone struggling with their sexual urges. That’s what will help our children grow up safely.

162,Warmer sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/2016-likely-be-world-s-hottest-year-here-s-why,"We’re not even halfway through the year but already you may have heard talk of 2016 being the hottest on record. But how can scientists be so sure we’re going to beat the previous record, set just last year?

Even before the end of 2015, the UK Met Office was forecasting with 95% confidence that 2016 would beat the record. Since then, that confidence has grown still further, as record after record has tumbled. April 2016 broke the record for the hottest April after we had experienced the hottest February and March on record already this year.

NASA climatologist Gavin Schmidt recently estimated at least a 99% likelihood of 2016 being hotter than 2015.

The Role Of El Niño

The main reason why scientists are so sure that 2016 will be the hottest year is El Niño, which is associated with warmer sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The 2015-16 El Niño was among the strongest on record and has increased global average temperatures.

Even though the El Niño is now decaying, the second year of a major El Niño event is often associated with much warmer than normal conditions and is typically warmer than the first.

For instance, the 1997-98 El Niño was by some measures the strongest on record, and contributed to 1998 becoming the hottest year on record globally at the time.

Since the start of this year, we have seen global temperature records smashed time and time again. This means that much colder temperatures for the second half of the year would be needed for 2016 not to surpass the 2015 record.

Even a strong La Niña event (the cooler opposite of El Niño), which some analysts are forecasting, is unlikely to produce cold enough temperatures.

One thing that could prevent 2016 becoming a record-breaking hot year is a major volcanic eruption in the tropics. Volcanic eruptions at low latitudes can eject aerosols high into the atmosphere reducing the amount of energy from the sun reaching the Earth’s surface.

Previous eruptions such as Pinatubo in 1991 and Tambora in 1815 (which caused 1816 to be “the year without a summer”) reduced temperatures across much of the globe.

However, it is the year after the eruption that often experiences the most severe cooling, so an eruption would have to be pretty soon and very strong to scupper 2016’s chances of being the hottest year on record.

What About Climate Change?

The role of climate change is smaller because we’re comparing 2016 with last year (the previous record). Over such short periods of time, the contribution from global warming doesn’t change much.

However, scientists estimated that 2015 was about 1℃ hotter than it would have been without human-caused climate change. As the human influence on the climate has not increased greatly since last year this 1℃ estimate will also apply to 2016.

The highly likely record temperature of 2016 will join the previous 17 record-breaking hot years back to 1937 which were all made more likely due to human-caused climate change (the rising global temperatures were even noticed as far back as 1938).

So even if El Niño is driving the 2016 record, we can say that the temperatures of this year (and indeed the temperatures associated with all the records over the last few years) would be virtually impossible without climate change.

Climate change has been increasing the likelihood of global temperature records for many decades. The vertical red bars show the record-breaking hot years we can attribute to human-induced climate change. The shorter yellow bars show ranges of estimates for how much more likely a record hot year becomes each year. Andrew King, Author provided

An Omen For The Future?

We expect 2016 to beat the 2015 record for global average temperature as the decaying El Niño event pushes up surface temperatures.

This year, we’ve already seen devastating events associated with unusually warm temperatures, like the mass coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef, which has been largely attributed to human-induced climate change.

In future, we can expect to see more extreme heat events, like we’ve already seen in 2016, impacting society and ecosystems across the world.

And even though 2016 is likely to be the hottest year by some margin, we wouldn’t bet on this record lasting too long. While 2017 is very likely to be cooler due to a possible La Niña, with the strong warming trend the world’s experiencing it’s only a matter of time before we have another record-breaking hot year.

Only if we substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions now will we see the benefit of fewer record heat events in the future.

You may then conclude that heating water results only in hotter water. But at some point everything changes – the water starts to boil, turning from hot liquid into steam. Physicists call this a “phase transition.”

Automation, driven by technological progress, has been increasing inexorably for the past several decades. Two schools of economic thinking have for many years been engaged in a debate about the potential effects of automation on jobs, employment and human activity: will new technology spawn mass unemployment, as the robots take jobs away from humans? Or will the jobs robots take over release or unveil – or even create – demand for new human jobs?

The debate has flared up again recently because of technological achievements such as deep learning, which recently enabled a Google software program called AlphaGo to beat Go world champion Lee Sedol, a task considered even harder than beating the world’s chess champions.

Ultimately the question boils down to this: are today’s modern technological innovations like those of the past, which made obsolete the job of buggy maker, but created the job of automobile manufacturer? Or is there something about today that is markedly different?

Malcolm Gladwell’s 2006 book The Tipping Point highlighted what he called “that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.” Can we really be confident that we are not approaching a tipping point, a phase transition – that we are not mistaking the trend of technology both destroying and creating jobs for a law that it will always continue this way?

Old worries about new tech

This is not a new concern. Dating back at least as far as the Luddites of early 19th-century Britain, new technologies cause fear about the inevitable changes they bring.

It may seem easy to dismiss today’s concerns as unfounded in reality. But economists Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University and Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University argue, “What if machines are getting so smart, thanks to their microprocessor brains, that they no longer need unskilled labor to operate?” After all, they write:

Smart machines now collect our highway tolls, check us out at stores, take our blood pressure, massage our backs, give us directions, answer our phones, print our documents, transmit our messages, rock our babies, read our books, turn on our lights, shine our shoes, guard our homes, fly our planes, write our wills, teach our children, kill our enemies, and the list goes on.

Looking at the economic data

There is considerable evidence that this concern may be justified. Eric Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of MIT recently wrote:

For several decades after World War II the economic statistics we care most about all rose together here in America as if they were tightly coupled. GDP grew, and so did productivity — our ability to get more output from each worker. At the same time, we created millions of jobs, and many of these were the kinds of jobs that allowed the average American worker, who didn’t (and still doesn’t) have a college degree, to enjoy a high and rising standard of living. But … productivity growth and employment growth started to become decoupled from each other.

Lots more productivity; not much more earning. U.S. Department of Labor Statistics

As the decoupling data show, the U.S. economy has been performing quite poorly for the bottom 90 percent of Americans for the past 40 years. Technology is driving productivity improvements, which grow the economy. But the rising tide is not lifting all boats, and most people are not seeing any benefit from this growth. While the U.S. economy is still creating jobs, it is not creating enough of them. The labor force participation rate, which measures the active portion of the labor force, has been dropping since the late 1990s.

While manufacturing output is at an all-time high, manufacturing employment is today lower than it was in the later 1940s. Wages for private nonsupervisory employees have stagnated since the late 1960s, and the wages-to-GDP ratio has been declining since 1970. Long-term unemployment is trending upwards, and inequality has become a global discussion topic, following the publication of Thomas Piketty’s 2014 book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century.

A widening danger?

Most shockingly, economists Angus Deaton, winner of the 2015 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, and Anne Case found that mortality for white middle-age Americans has been increasing over the past 25 years, due to an epidemic of suicides and afflictions stemming from substance abuse.

Is automation, driven by progress in technology, in general, and artificial intelligence and robotics, in particular, the main cause for the economic decline of working Americans?

In economics, it is easier to agree on the data than to agree on causality. Many other factors can be in play, such as globalization, deregulation, decline of unions and the like. Yet, in a 2014 poll of leading academic economists conducted by the Chicago Initiative on Global Markets regarding the impact of technology on employment and earnings, 43 percent of those polled agreed with the statement that “information technology and automation are a central reason why median wages have been stagnant in the U.S. over the decade, despite rising productivity,” while only 28 percent disagreed. Similarly, a 2015 study by the International Monetary Fund concluded that technological progress is a major factor in the increase of inequality over the past decades.

The bottom line is that while automation is eliminating many jobs in the economy that were once done by people, there is no sign that the introduction of technologies in recent years is creating an equal number of well-paying jobs to compensate for those losses. A 2014 Oxford study found that the number of U.S. workers shifting into new industries has been strikingly small: in 2010, only 0.5 percent of the labor force was employed in industries that did not exist in 2000.

The discussion about humans, machines and work tends to be a discussion about some undetermined point in the far future. But it is time to face reality. The future is now.

164,Artificial Sweetener. ,http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/fda-warns-artificial-sweetener-can-be-fatal-dogs,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released an official warning to dog owners on the dangers of xylitol, an artificial sweetener used in many household products. While safe for humans, the ingredient can be fatal for their furry companion.

The toxicity of xylitol for dogs has been known for some time, but this is the first official advisory from the FDA. The warning comes amid an increase in the number of dogs accidentally poisoned by xylitol – a figure that has increased from 82 cases in 2004 to more than 3,700 in 2014.

Products that contain xylitol include sugar-free gum, certain baked goods, cough syrup, chocolate bars, children’s and adult chewable vitamins, mouthwash, and toothpaste.

If ingested by your pet pooch, the sweetener can cause their pancreas to rapidly release insulin, dropping their blood sugar to dangerously low levels – all within 10 to 60 minutes of consumption.

“In people, xylitol does not stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas. However, it’s different in canines: When dogs eat something containing xylitol, the xylitol is more quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, and may result in a potent release of insulin from the pancreas,” wrote the FDA in a statement. This results in hypoglycemia, a possibly life-threatening condition if not treated.

Depending on the amount consumed, side effects can take up to 12 to 24 hours to appear, so it is best to stay vigilant during this time. Symptoms to look for include vomiting, weakness, staggering, lack of coordination, collapse, and seizures. If your dog has consumed xylitol, take your pet to the nearest vet or emergency animal hospital.

Other items that dogs should not eat include grapes, raisins, alcohol, onion, garlic, macadamia nuts, avocados, and caffeine. As a side note, the FDA said they do not know whether xylitol is poisonous to cats, as they tend to show disdain for sweets.

The takeaway: There is nothing sweet about giving your dog artificial sweetener, so keep your gum and chocolate bars out of paws reach.",2016-05-18 16:00:00
165,It crushes the diamond. ,http://www.iflscience.com/physics/hydraulic-press-channel-takes-one-natures-hardest-materials,"The Hydraulic Press Channel has had a meteoric rise to fame over the past few months, simply by satisfying our appetite for mindless destruction and showing millions of people how amazing Finnish accents are. So far, it’s squished everything from bowling balls to non-Newtonian fluid . But now they must face nature's hardest substance: diamond.

The diamond was donated to the channel by a generous diamond retailer looking to jump on the viral bandwagon. As stated in the video, it’s a 1.2 carat jewel and worth at least $4,000, complete with its own certificate to prove it’s the real deal.

So, as Lauri Vuohensilta – the mad genius behind the channel – says in the video: “They say diamonds are forever, but how long?”

As it turns out, not very long.

So, how was the diamond broken so easily? As some have pointed out, the “hardness” that diamonds are known for only really refers to their ability to be scratch-resistant. While the covalent bonds between the diamond atoms themselves are extremely strong, diamonds can also be brittle, especially if there’s any kind of defect or it’s been poorly cut. Scientists have even discovered materials that are actually harder than diamonds, such as wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite.

Nevertheless, it’s still pretty impressive how swiftly the hydraulic press manages to shatter the diamond. That, and the ""bonus crushing"" of the plasticine model at the end is a particularly good one.",2016-05-18 14:33:26
166,"A few miles high, but not into space. ",http://mentalfloss.com/article/79672/how-high-can-runaway-helium-balloons-fly,"If there is no ceiling or other obstacle in their way, balloons ascend higher and higher until they are out of view, but how high can balloons actually fly? Helium-filled balloons can reach several miles above the Earth's surface, but they cannot float into space (if they could, that'd just mean more space junk we'd have to deal with).

According to Robert Matthews of Science Focus, toy balloons can ascend around six miles high, while weather balloons (which are made of more durable materials) can go three times that distance. This is thanks to the Archimedes Principle (explained here in this Carol Hodanbosi article for NASA). The balloon floats in the first place because its helium is less dense than the air outside. As a balloon climbs higher, the surrounding air pressure drops, and the helium inside expands. When the density of the balloon matches the density of the air, its ascension stops. And when the expanding helium becomes too much for the toy balloon's latex material, it bursts.

Please don't feel compelled to test this out, however. Not only do helium balloons mess with wildlife, they have also been known to cause problems for commercial planes. Sorry to burst your bubble.",2016-05-18 04:38:10
167,28-32. ,https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/the-right-age-to-get-married-126672874767.html,"Research shows a “sweet spot” for marriage — but should we believe it? (Photo: Stocksy/Studio Firma)

Go to college. Get your career established. Date around. Find out what you’re looking for in a life partner. Wait to get married.

That’s been the prevailing logic when it comes to minimizing your odds of divorce for some time now. But in a study released last month, University of Utah researcher Nicholas Wolfinger, PhD, asserts there is actually an optimal age range for lasting marriage — and you shouldn’t wait too long. He found that likelihood of divorce is lowest when you get hitched between the ages of 28 and 32.

Wolfinger, an adjunct professor of sociology at the university, had previously found a U-shaped relationship between age at marriage and likelihood of divorce by looking at data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) back in 2006 to 2010. The NSFG polled more 22,000 men and women aged 15 to 44 on topics ranging from factors determining marriage and divorce, to attitudes about sex and pregnancy.

Ever the good researcher, Wolfinger wanted to see if he could replicate those initial findings by pulling additional NSFG stats from 2011 to 2013. He got nearly identical information: Age 28 through 32 is the sweet spot for marriage — get married before or after that, and risk of splitting from a spouse increases.

“The odds of divorce decline as you age from your teenage years through your late twenties and early thirties,” Wolfinger writes. “Thereafter, the chances of divorce go up again as you move into your late thirties and early forties.” After age 32, divorce risk climbs about 5 percent each year.

But not so fast. Wolfinger’s findings are something to consider, sure — but they’re not a reason to freak out.

Related: The Best Times and Places to Have Major Relationship Conversations

There have been some naysayers of the findings, notably Phillip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. He has found a slightly older “perfect marriage” age range, using different data than Wolfinger. He found there’s, ultimately, no reason to worry if you get married later on. Cohen’s stats were from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, sent out to 295,000 American households per month to collect ongoing data on social, economic, and housing characteristics of individual communities.

Story continues

And here’s another very important thing to point out about Wolfinger’s study: It only looks at divorce during the first five years after marriage, says psychologist Karla Ivankovich, an adjunct professor at the University of Illinois at Springfield. Ideally, a marriage is going to last longer than half a decade. “So there is still possibility of divorce, just not in the time frame identified within the study,” she tells Yahoo Health.

In a way, that 28-to-32 demographic does make sense. By that age, you know a lot more about who you are, what you want out of life, and what you want in a life partner, than you did in your early 20s.

Interestingly, Marisa T. Cohen, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at St. Francis College and co-founder of the Self-Awareness and Bonding Lab, has polled the masses on this very subject: What’s the best age to get married? She found daters are pretty in sync with Wolfinger’s findings: After examining opinions from 773 people, “an overwhelming majority — 83.7 percent — felt that it is ideal to get married in between 25 to 34 years of age,” she tells Yahoo Health.

But even though getting married in this age range is something we say we want, that doesn’t mean this is the time all of us are universally ready for marriage, she caveats. “You need to be committed in order to make a marriage work. Some of the causes of divorce, besides infidelity, are lack of communication, being incompatible partners, and growing apart,” Cohen notes. “Basically, if you don’t know who you are as a person, you won’t be a good partner.”

Instead of focusing on age as the decider of when to get married, we should instead focus on social environments and life experiences — and growing out of that “emerging adulthood” phase, which generally rolls through our post-grad, mid-20s years — to determine when marriage is appropriate.

What we do know: Younger marriages are more likely to end, research shows — and the reason is the romantic landscape in a person’s early dating years. “We aren’t just seeing a change in the overall divorce rate and an increase in the divorce rate of those who marry young, but overall we are seeing a shift in the basic way in which people court one another,” Cohen explains. “What was once dating and courting, is now more of a ‘hookup’ culture in college. What was once getting to know you, your values and morals, is now right and left swipes.”

It takes time to get all those “options” out of your system, and settle on the person who is right for you. And it’s not just the romantic aspects of marriage, but also the practical ones, that come into consideration. It takes time to come to fully bear all the responsibilities Mom and Dad had been shouldering before — like car payments, rent, insurance, general life decisions — and all that takes place during this “emerging adulthood” period.

Now for the other side of that 28-to-32 group. If you choose to get married at an older age, you have been flying solo much longer, says Carin Goldstein, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in Santa Monica, California. “You’re pretty set in your ways,” she tells Yahoo Health. “You’re less willing to compromise or accommodate a partner’s opinion into your own. When you’ve been supporting yourself and making your own decisions for years, it’s harder to get used to the idea of someone else’s opinion.”

Now that we’ve looked at the logic behind the magical “28 to 32,” it’s time to examine why getting hitched before or after that age range is by no means a death sentence for your marriage. (Do relax.) In fact, that range won’t be right for everyone.

Ivankovich compares determining the ideal age a person should get married to spinning the mystery wheel at your favorite casino. “It is not so much a number, but dependent on an individual’s maturity, and ability to commit to a long-term relationship,” she explains. “Prior experiences with marriage — how [a person was] raised, psychosocial situations, religious factors, you name it — all impact readiness.”

Indeed, there are many factors that determine marital success, according to Liz Keneski, a PhD candidate in human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. She’s conducted work alongside Tim Loving, PhD, an associate professor in the School of Human Ecology at the university, examining the recipe for marital success.

One major predictor: how family and friends in the couple’s sphere of influence view the developing relationship. “People readily recognize norms for relationship development — or how relationships ‘should’ go, based on what’s typical for our society,” Keneski tells Yahoo Health.

For instance, according to Keneski and Loving’s work, couples’ friends and family members report liking a loved one’s partner more when they perceive the relationship is progressing normatively (a.k.a. nothing out of the ordinary, no apparent red flags). “They report doing things to show their support for the relationship more, too, like inviting the loved one’s partner over for an event, hugging the partner, or asking about the partner,” Keneski says.

Related: 5 Relationship Secrets From Couples Who’ve Been Together For 40+ Years

In other words, people really like when relationships follow the “typical” script — and just like friends and family, we probably like to see that regular progression in our own relationships, too. Keneski and Loving have found that dating milestones matter a great deal, checking boxes like first kiss, first intercourse, meeting one another’s friends and parents (and so forth), in a steady order. However, what seems to matter is the order of these events and how well they go — and not necessarily how fast they occur.

No matter your age, you have to be open to amending your timeline to marriage a bit. Everyone’s journey to the altar, should they want to reach it, is very personal. But here are some areas of focus couples must work on to make a marriage last at any age.

Early on: Smell the roses.

Early in your marriage — especially if you marry in or before that “sweet spot” — Ivankovich suggests taking some time for yourselves as a couple. Plan for the future, instead of rushing through it. Discuss family, instead of starting one. Travel the world, instead of settling in one place. In other words: Stop and smell the roses. “Life is just beginning, so take a moment to explore before settling down,” she explains. “Learn about careers, enjoy time together.” There will be lots of time to establish yourselves.

As you grow: Build strong relationships apart from your significant other.

Keneski says that, ironically, a strong pairing is not just about two people. “Working on your relationship with your partner is certainly paramount in creating a great foundation for a relationship,” says Keneski, “but don’t forget to foster strong relationships with friends and family outside of your relationship. What they think of your relationship and how they interact with you and your partner matters for the happiness of your relationship.”

As you add family: Flexibility goes a long way.

Ivankovich says that the more you are able to roll with the punches and make adjustments to your plan, the happier you will be — especially as you begin to factor kids and family into the equation. “Long-term plans involve love,” she says. “Take some time to create a map for the future and consider how this will impact a life that involves family — but be willing to adapt to whatever life throws your way.”

As you mature: Decide to stay married…

Marriage and family therapist Jodie Voth says she’s polled couples in the later stages of their relationships, asking them how they’d made it last. “I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again,” she tells Yahoo Health. “If ‘marriage forever’ is your goal, every successful couple past 40 years of marriage has told me the same thing: It is a decision to stay married. Not romance, not flexibility, not negotiation or communication skills — it is a decision. Sometimes, every day.” So, the next time you two get into an argument and cannot see eye-to-eye? Voth says you say, “I’m gonna stick this out, because I want to be married to this person for the rest of my life.” And then, you keep working on it.

… And don’t foster contempt.

While deciding to stay married is hardly romantic, Voth says studies from psychologist John Gottman reveal what can make the whole experience much happier — and more likely to remain intact, too. “His research tells us that allowing yourself to be influenced by your partner and refraining from contemptuous behavior are what make marriages last,” she explains. “So, yes, keep divorce off the table — but also be open to hearing your partner’s opinion, and stop rolling your eyes and using sarcasm to communicate.” Marriage is more pleasant if you work together constructively. Leave contempt at the door.

169,Not making your bed exposes dust mites to air/sunlight and kills them. ,http://www.domain.com.au/advice/why-you-should-never-make-your-bed-20151001-gjy8f6/,"People often tell you to make your bed because it ‘starts the day off well’ or that it brings order and calm.

But the lazy among us have always known making your bed is a bad idea.

For starters, it’s difficult to see the point of arranging all your throw pillows and stuffed animals on the bed if you’re only going to push them off hours later.

If you have to leave the house early in the morning you’re probably all bleary-eyed and you don’t have the time or desire for tackling chores.

Even if you thought about making your bed, as soon as someone nags you to do it, that immediately makes you not want to do it. It’s all very complicated.

Plus, it’s harder to get comfortable in your bed if it’s been made and the sheets are firmly tucked in. (I like to create a cocoon out of blankets and fold all the sheets up around my legs, to the point where it’s stupidly warm, which is why bed-making is not for me.)

Another thing to consider: if you make your bed in the morning, that means you’re telling yourself that you won’t be getting back into it for the rest of the day, and you just don’t need to place those boundaries on yourself.

Finally, all these very valid points have now also been backed up by scientific evidence. Thanks science.

According to reports, making your bed every morning may be bad for your health.

The reason is dust mites; they don’t just look nasty, they are nasty.

In the average bed there’s as many as 1.5 million microscopic mites crawling around and feasting off the skin cells you shed while you sleep.

In the morning, if you make your bed immediately, all of the skin cells, sweat, mites and their droppings – which can cause asthma and allergies – will be trapped underneath.

However, if the bed is left unmade, the mites, dead skin, the sweat, all of it, will be exposed to fresh air and light.

So, if you have to make your bed it is better to wait until the evening. By that point your bed is much less appealing to dust mites and they will have died from dehydration or just lost interest.

What you should do to mitigate allergies is wash your sheets every one-to-two weeks, use a damp mop or rag to remove dust and encase your mattress and pillows in dust-proof or allergen impermeable covers.

170,You can't react fast enough. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/watch-there-s-a-mathematical-reason-for-why-you-can-t-catch-a-dollar-bill-in-your-fingers,"Here's a life tip for you - if a stranger ever comes up to you in the street, telling you he'll give you a dollar bill for free, and all you have to do is catch it between your fingers when he drops it, get the hell out of there, it's a trap!

Seriously though, test it out with a friend, and unless you're an exceptional human being, you will never ever catch that dollar bill. But don't feel bad - there's a mathematical reason for why it can't be done, and it's rooted in the biological fact that the reaction time for most humans is about 0.2 seconds.

Yep, 0.2 seconds approximately how long it takes for you to see something, process it, and physically react to it, which is actually pretty impressive when you think about it. But that's not nearly quick enough for your eyes to see that falling dollar bill, and have your brain to process that information, and instruct your fingers to snap together in time to catch it.

So case closed, right? Well not quite, because you're perfectly capable of catching things on the fly - humans aren't completely useless - so why not some sweet, sweet cash?

As the Numberphile video above explains, it all comes down to some good old high school maths. We all know that when we drop an item from a height, you can figure out the time it will take to get to the ground based on the falling velocity and the distance travelled. Or you can figured out the distance travelled based on the falling velocity and time it takes to get to the ground.

You just need to use an equation like this, D = 1/2 gt2, where D = distance, t = time, g = gravititation acceleration, and gt = falling velocity. On Earth, gravitational acceleration is measured at 9.8 m/s2, but for the purposes of this calculation, Numberphile mathematician Tadashi Tokieda has rounded that value up to 10.

If all that is giving you maths homework nightmares, don't worry, the video above does all the work. Just sit back, relax, and feel smart by osmosis.

So when you use this equation to figure out a distance based on the human reaction time of 0.2 seconds and gravitational acceleration value of 10, you get 0.2 metres, or 20 cm.

If you measure a dollar bill, you'll find that it's around 15 cm long, which means that if someone is holding it at 5 cm or less above your fingers, it's pretty much impossible for you to react fast enough to catch it. Curse you, slow mortal brain!

But don't give up just yet, because there is hope if your one dream in life is to catch falling money between your fingers.

You'll have to watch the Numberphile video above to find out why even someone without above average reaction times could improve their chances of achieving this feat, but let's just say if you do agree to that stranger's bet in the street, make sure he lets you choose which fingers to use.

171,"Without a GPS, scent. ",http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/how-dogs-find-their-way-home-without-gps,"Animals’ ability to navigate long distances has long been shrouded in mystery. From the skill of racing pigeons to find their way home, to the seasonal breeding migration of the humpback whale, a huge range of creatures are capable of navigating in a consistent, precise and effective way.

Science has been slow to fully identify and understand the processes and cues involved in animal migration. However, evidence now suggests that a vast array of species, from beetles to birds to dogs, demonstrate amazing abilities to travel long distances, without the use of electronic GPS – something many humans have perhaps become over-reliant upon.

In April, the story of Pero, an adventurous four-year-old working sheepdog was reported. Pero managed to find his way from Cockermouth in Cumbria back to his previous home, near Aberystwyth, on the coast of mid Wales. In a real-life story reminiscent of “Lassie Come Home”, Pero somehow navigated about 240 miles in two weeks. Significantly, his microchip confirmed this was not a case of mistaken identity, this young sheepdog really had made it back to his first home.

Stories like that of Pero’s often attract media interest, leaving readers puzzled over how an animal can travel so far. Without speculating over whether the dog had been simply dropped off at the farm by someone who recognised him, these sorts of tales apparently prove the remarkable nature of animal instincts. The deep relationship between people and their dogs also seems to drive a desire to believe that there is something magical about this ability. So, is this navigation skill because of “personal bonds” between owner and dog, or is there a scientific understanding of the biology involved?

Sniffing out adventure. www.shutterstock.com/Kevin Lobene

A huge variety of animals use a number of different sensory systems in order to travel distances. Desert ants, for example, use environmental olfactory cues and odour plumes – clouds of scent dispersed by the wind moving odour molecules – to navigate their way both to food sources and back to their nests. Honeybees appear able to recall routes to feeding sites when exposed to scent from that location. Other species such as sea turtles, some amphibians, spiny lobsters and birds are able to use magnetic positional information to migrate or orientate towards specific target locations. This latter ability to exploit geomagnetic information is significant, as it is unlikely to be affected by weather conditions, cycles of light and dark, seasonality or global position in the same way that other cues might be affected.

In addition to a “magnetic compass”, birds also appear to use sun and star “compasses” for navigation. Parasitic nematode worms are capable of moving towards new hosts by responding to seismic vibrations and other species use vibrations for prey capture. Bats, birds and marine mammals can also identify location and travel with the help of sonar and infrasound, while visual landmarks appear critical for species such as ourselves.

Pero’s tale.

But just how did Pero find his way home? It is likely that many animals, including dogs, navigate using an integration of many of the internal systems and external signals mentioned above. Dogs are also very reward driven – so positive associations with particular places or people are likely to result in a desire to return. The intense olfactory ability of dogs is also likely to assist location awareness – my own dogs appear to “smell” the beach miles before we actually see it.

Interestingly, recent evidence that dogs and some primates possess a molecule associated with magnetoreception – the ability to sense a magnetic field – might further explain Pero’s return home. Cryptochrome 1 is a light-sensing molecule that regulates circadian rythmns in species as diverse as plants and fish. It seems that this molecule is present in the retinal cone cells of a range of other species too, including dogs, foxes, wolves, bears and badgers. It has also been identified in some primate species including the Bornean orangutan.

The reason for the presence of this molecule remains undetermined and researchers have acknowledged that it might not be related to magnetoreception. However, the identification of cryptochrome 1 in the photoreceptors of these mammals' eyes is identical to the location of the same molecule in birds. This might suggest that the ability to respond to magnetic positional information is maintained in birds and some mammals. Indeed, magnetoreception has been documented in different mammal species, leading to the suggestion that dogs might even defecate in response to the earth’s magnetic field.

It is interesting to note that researchers have as yet failed to identify this molecule in species such as bats, an animal already known to be capable of navigating using magnetic fields. Perhaps some species have evolved different ways to use magnetic fields to identify location, or, alternatively, a range of interacting biological processes may be involved.

It is important to remember however, that Pero and other animals reported as having travelled miraculous distances tend to be the exception rather than the rule. For every amazing story of a pet dog or cat travelling huge distances to return “home”, there are many more who are quite simply, lost. For those animals, even a deep bond with their human caregiver is not enough to drive or facilitate a long-distance return.

So while there does appear to be some fundamental biology that means even our domesticated species can navigate long distances, nailing down the exact science that enabled Pero’s exceptional feat of navigation remains tricky.

172,A Snake. ,http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/these-fisherman-found-something-very-unexpected-lurking-cod-s-mouth,"Andy Warton got a surprising two-for-one-deal when he was fishing around Melville Island in Australia’s Northern Territory.

“This is a cod and it’s got a snake in its mouth…. He’s just eaten it! Ain’t that incredible,” you can hear the person say from behind the camera in their video posted to YouTube by Caters Clips.

After removing the lure and plucking the snake from the cod's mouth, they released the fish back into the waters and it appeared to swim off. The snake might not look in the best of shape, but Warton told The Mirror that the snake was still alive.

He added: ""I've seen crocodiles eat pigs and eagles, I've had big barramundi stolen by sharks, but up until this experience, I've never seen a fish with a fresh snake in its belly.”",2016-05-15 18:37:23
173,"It has to do whether or not you think people, especially yourself, can change. ",http://time.com/4198374/psychology-past-romance/?xid=time_socialflow_facebook,"A friend once grumbled that, given the choice, she’d rather see her ex miserable than herself happy.

Few things in life are as traumatic as the end of a long-term, romantic relationship. Nonetheless, many people are able to eventually recover and move on relatively unscathed.

Others, like my friend, aren’t so lucky. Even years later, they remain mired in the pain of the experience. Any reminder of their former partner – whether it’s a casual mention in conversation or a Facebook photo – can elicit profound feelings of sadness, anger and resentment.

Why is it that some people continue to be haunted by the ghosts of their romantic pasts, struggling to let go of the pain of rejection?

In new research, my colleague Carol Dweck and I found that rejection actually makes some people redefine themselves—and their future romantic prospects.

In one study, we asked people to write about any lessons they’d taken away from a past romantic rejection. Analyzing their responses, we realized that a number of respondents thought the rejection unmasked a basic negative truth about themselves—one that would also sabotage their future relationships. Some said they’d realized that they were too “clingy.” Other thought they’d been “too sensitive” or “bad at communicating.”

Additional studies explored the consequences of believing that rejection had revealed a fundamental flaw. By linking rejection to some aspect of their core identity, people found it more difficult to move on from the experience. Some said they “put up walls” and became warier about new relationships. Others were afraid to disclose the rejection to a new partner, fearing that this person would change their opinion of them, thinking they had “baggage.” (This might explain why some people hide past rejections, treating them like a scar or stigma.)

We then wondered: what makes someone more likely to link a romantic rejection to some aspect of “who they really are”? After all, other respondents wrote that rejection was merely a part of life, that it was an important part of growing up and actually caused them to become better people.

It turns out that your beliefs about personality can play a big role in how you’ll respond to romantic rejection.

Past research has found that people hold divergent views about their personal characteristics, whether it’s their intelligence or shyness. Some people have a “fixed mindset,” believing that these qualities are unchangeable. In contrast, those who have a “growth mindset” believe that their personality is something that can evolve and develop throughout their lives.

These basic beliefs shape how people respond to failure. For example, when people believe that intelligence is fixed, they’ll feel worse about themselves – and are less likely to persist – after experiencing a setback.

We thought that beliefs about personality might determine whether people see rejection as a piece of evidence about who they really are – as a sign of whether they are a flawed and undesirable person.

In one study, we divided people into two groups: those who think personality is fixed, and those who think personality is malleable. Participants then read one of two stories. In one, we asked them to imagine being left, out of the blue, by a long-term partner. In the other, we asked them to imagine meeting someone at a party, feeling a spark and then later overhearing that person telling a friend that they would never be romantically interested in her or him.

We might expect that only a severe rejection from a serious relationship would have the power to make people question who they are. Instead, a pattern emerged. For people with a fixed view of personality, we found that even a rejection from a relative stranger could prompt them to wonder what this rejection unveiled about their core self. These people might worry that there was something so obviously undesirable about them that a person would reject them outright—without even getting to know them.

So what can we do to prevent people from linking rejection to the self in this negative way? One promising piece of evidence shows that changing someone’s beliefs about personality can shift his or her reaction to rejections.

In a final study, we created articles that described personality as something that can evolve throughout the course of a lifetime, rather than as something that’s predetermined. When we asked people with a fixed view of personality to read these articles, they became less likely to interpret rejections as an indication of a permanent, fatal deficiency.

By encouraging the belief that personality can change and develop over time, we may be able to help people exorcise the ghosts of their romantic pasts—and move on to satisfying relationships in the future.

As of Thursday, Emma Morano is the only person on Earth who was born in the 1800s. She credits her longevity to her very bizarre diet.

The 116-year-old Italian woman isn’t gluten-free, vegan, or Paleo. She’s not gulping green smoothies or snacking on superfoods. Morano told the Associated Press she eats two raw eggs a day. Yes, really.

Since developing anemia as a child, Morano has been on the raw egg kick. It was her doctor who suggested she should add the eggs to her diet when she was just a young girl.

“

Morano’s secret doesn’t mean we should all be slugging back egg yolks in the name of health. Even though instances of egg-related salmonella have reportedly decreased since 1998, eggs for human consumption are probably better off cooked, because hey — why risk it? Plus, one study found that egg protein is more digestible when cooked, yet another compelling reason we should fully cook our omelets.

Whether or not raw eggs are all they’re cracked up to be (had to), Morano’s old age isn’t out of the ordinary for Italy, w number of centenarians. In one village, there are roughly 300 people over 100 years old, NPR reported.

175,It's worm poop. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/these-mysterious-south-american-mounds-turn-out-be-giant-piles-of-worm-poop,"Scientists have long puzzled over what created strange mound formations in the tropical wetlands of South America, and a new study appears to have found the answer.

The mounds, which are called surales, are found throughout the Orinoco Llanos wetlands of Columbia and Venezuela, and according to research led by archaeologist and palaeoethnobotanist José Iriarte, these spectacular formations are actually massive conglomerations of worm poop.

Surales vary in size, with the largest mounds measuring up to 5 metres in diameter and up to 2 metres tall. To figure out how these gigantic lumps came to be, Iriarte, a researcher from the University of Exeter in the UK, and his team analysed the physical and chemical makeup of the mounds' soil.

The team found that up to one half of the total soil mass of the mounds is composed of earthworm casts – the muddy soil byproduct ejected from worm guts. It's not surprising that worms leave their casts behind – after all, everybody has to go sometimes – but how do their poop piles become so… comically epic?

According to the researchers, the surales form when large earthworms feed in shallow, flooded soils within the wetlands. These big guys leave their larger deposits behind, creating mini poop 'towers' that start sticking above the surface of the water. Kind of like when Saruman's tower becomes flooded in by the Ents… except with worm poop instead of an evil wizard.

After enough time, this casts tower begins to form into a mound, and the largest surales are formed when a couple of smaller mounds situated close enough fuse together.

Professor José Iriarte

Despite the surales' somewhat humble beginnings, now that we know how they come to be, it helps solve a riddle that has long perplexed researchers. Previous hypotheses on their formation included termite activity and a form of land erosion, but the new findings finally discount those explanations.

""This exciting discovery allows us to map and understand how these massive landscapes were formed,"" said Iriarte. ""The fact we know they were created by earthworms across the seasonally flooded savannahs of South America will certainly change how we think about human versus naturally-built landscapes in the region.""

The findings are reported in PLOS ONE.",2016-05-13 12:00:00
176,You get an oscillating circuit. ,https://www.wired.com/2016/05/go-ahead-connect-inductor-capacitor-see-happens/,"What happens when you put an inductor and a capacitor in a circuit? Something kind of cool---and actually important.

What is an inductor?

You can make all sorts of different types of inductors, but the most common type is cylindrical coil of wire---a solenoid.

When current runs through the first loop, it creates a magnetic field that passes through the other loops. Magnetic fields don't really do anything unless the the magnitude changes. A changing magnetic field will create an electric field in the other loops. The direction of this electric field will make a change in electric potential that acts like a battery.

In the end, we have a device that has a potential difference that is proportional to the time rate of change of the current (since the current makes the magnetic field). This can be written as:

There are two things to point out in this equation. First, the L is the inductance. It only depends on the geometry of the solenoid (or whatever shape you have) and its value is measured in Henry's. Second, there is the negative sign. This means the change in potential across the inductor opposes the change in current.

How does an inductor behave in a circuit? If you have a constant current, then there is no change (DC current) and thus no potential difference across the inductor---it acts like it's not even there. If there is a high frequency current (AC circuit) then there will be a large potential difference across the inductor.

What is a capacitor?

Again, there are lots of different configurations for a capacitor. The simplest shape uses two parallel conducting plates with electric charge on each plate (but a net charge of zero).

The electric charge on these plates creates an electric field inside the capacitor. Since there is an electric field, there must also be a change in electric potential across the plates. The value of this potential difference depends on the amount of charge. The potential difference across the capacitor can be written as:

Here C is the value of the capacitance in units of Farads---it also only depends on the physical configuration of the device.

If there is a current going into the capacitor, the value of the charge on the plates will change. If there is a constant (or low frequency) current, this current will continue to add charge to plates to increase the electric potential so that over time, this potential will eventually act like an open circuit with the capacitor voltage equal to the battery voltage (or power supply). If you have a high frequency current, the charge will be both added and taken away from the plates in the capacitor with no charge build up and the capacitor will act like it's not even there.

What happens when you connect a capacitor and an inductor?

Suppose we start with a charged capacitor and hook it up to an inductor (no resistance in the circuit because I am using perfect physics-wires). Think about the instant right when these two are connected. Suppose there is a switch, then I can draw the following diagrams.",2016-05-12 20:33:00

Unless you're an amphibian or a superhero (Fish Woman, anybody?), the answer will be ""No."" The brain's innate drive for oxygen would override any ""willpower"" to win the prize.

Unnervingly, if you're currently living on a steady diet of sugar-enhanced foods, your brain is similarly re-wired, demanding that next ""hit."" Your willpower has as much of a chance at resistance as the ability to keep your body underwater.

We know sugar is not a healthy substance -- but it was this stunning example by my colleague Dr. Mark Hyman about its impact on our brain that really drove home the message. You see, I'm a reformed sugar addict. During residency, a long ER shift was the cue for a few bags of Skittles. A studying session led to Swedish Fish. But I realized that these sugar hits always led to a crash -- and then a craving for even more -- which made it clear to me that it was time to make a change.

Your Brain on Sugar

Advertisement

Sugar acts within the brain's ""Reward Center"" mechanism (it's like the brain's equivalent of the elementary school Gold Star chart, or if you're like me and in a home with a toddler right now, the ""Potty Chart""). Upon eating sugar, your brain releases Dopamine, our favorite ""feel good"" hormone, the same one that's triggered by other pleasure mechanisms like sex, exercise, and, on the bad side of the spectrum, drugs like cocaine or meth.

Through the same mechanisms as drug addiction, frequent sugar intake means that the brain eventually gets accustomed to that high and become less sensitive to sugar. So to get the same rush, your brain requires more and more sugar over time.

Here's how it works: You eat a sugary food, your blood sugar levels spike, and your body releases Dopamine (yay!) and insulin (which triggers your body to store the sugar as fat). Then comes the ""crash"": your sugar level plummets and you feel tired, hungry, and reach for the next sugary treat. It's purely chemistry, my dear, and these physical urges completely override your willpower and desire to eat healthfully.

Break the Sugar Cycle

So are you doomed to be a victim to brain chemistry? Hardly. Just as excess sugar rewired your brain in the first place, cutting back can reverse the dependence, just as I did. But this is harder than it sounds, largely because:

(1) It's everywhere: Added sugar is included -- sometimes as the second or third ingredient -- in over 70% of packaged foods. Think everything from breakfast cereals to BBQ sauce to salad dressings and so-called ""healthy snacks"" like granola bars or even those ""heart approved"" refined-carb breakfast cereals. The FDA just acknowledged the confusion behind these labels this week and is looking at redefining them, but until then, it's fair game for sugar-ladened snacks to boast the ""healthy"" designation.

(2) It's sneaky: Sugar exists in many forms, making it easy for the food industry to hide it in ingredient lists, listed with other names in foods you might not even think of as ""sugary.""

The Let's-Be-Realistic Bottom Line

Look, we all know the white stuff is going to sneak in somewhere, sometime, into our own and our kids' diets. You don't need to become a biochemist to cut back, and you can still even have a sugary treat once in a while. But if you're tired of this sugary chemistry experiment going on in your brain, follow these 3 steps to at least minimize the majority of added sugar.

Learn its disguises:

As tricky as this seems, sugar is almost never called just ""sugar"" on ingredient lists, so you have to be smart about spotting where it hides.

There are at least 61 different names for sugar on food labels. I may be a science nerd at times, but even I don't expect you to memorize them. Here are a few tricks: avoid anything ending in ""-ose"" like sucrose or maltrose. Look out for the buzzwords of ""syrup,"" ""nectar,"" ""cane"" and ""sweetener."" And be mindful that even natural sugars, like agave or honey, still contribute to your daily sugar limit. If sugar (or any of these terms) is in the top 5 ingredients, it's a treat, and not a nutritious food.

Cut Out Liquid Sugar:

Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages? News flash -- your brain doesn't even recognize these calories as food, leading to a high and crash that will end with you eating even more. Public enemy #1 is soda -- with up to 46 grams in a single 12-oz can, one drinks can put you over the sugar limit for the entire day (24 grams per day for women and 36 for men, per the AHA). Multiple studies have suggested the link between increased soda consumption and obesity in the U.S.

Advertisement

But it's not just soda -- watch the ""healthy juice"" too: many juices and seemingly healthy drinks contain added sugar. For the most part, unless you're talking a fresh-pressed, unsweetened juice, you're better off eating a whole piece of fruit. And to settle the whole fruit-is-sugar debate, while fruit does have sugar in the form of fructose, it's nothing in comparison to added sugars and doesn't cause the same blood-spiking mechanisms. There's no need to limit fruit if you're focusing on cutting back added sugar.

DIY It:

You don't have to completely cut out everything sweet; I don't like my coffee black or my yogurt plain. But it's a lot easier to control the amount of sugar you're adding if you do it yourself. Add a half-packet to coffee instead of letting the barista talk you into a fancy sweetened frappe. Buy plain Greek yogurt and add berries and honey; I guarantee it will have less sugar than the fruit-flavored, sugar-laden packaged kind. As it often does, it comes down to a simple truth: it's a lot easier to know what's going on in your body if you control what you put into it.

178,"It may reduce your capacity for empathy but pain may also reduce that as well.
",http://elitedaily.com/wellness/tylenol-side-effects-empathy/1491466/,"Zapping your headache by popping a few pills may also be killing your ability to feel.

In a new study published by The Ohio State University in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, researchers reveal, acetaminophen may reduce the ability to feel empathy for others.

Acetaminophen also happens to be the main ingredient in Tylenol.

To come to its conclusion, the team devised two double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments.

As the team describes,

...participants rated perceived pain, personal distress, and empathic concern in response to reading physical or social pain scenarios, witnessing ostracism in the lab, or visualizing another study participant receiving painful noise blasts.

The study came to its findings after having 40 college-aged participants take 1,000 mg of acetaminophen, while 40 more participants took a placebo.

The group then read eight different and unpleasant scenarios. In the end, the group that took the acetaminophen rated the scenarios as ""less severe"" than their placebo counterparts.

The team tested the results with a second set of 114 college students and came to similar findings.

How can this really translate into your everyday life?

Baldwin Way, senior author of the study, told Science Daily,

If you are having an argument with your spouse and you just took acetaminophen, this research suggests you might be less understanding of what you did to hurt your spouse's feelings.

The pure volume of acetaminophen taken in the US can also have profound effects on society as well. As the team concluded in its abstract,

Because empathy regulates prosocial and antisocial behavior, these drug-induced reductions in empathy raise concerns about the broader social side effects of acetaminophen, which is taken by almost a quarter of US adults each week.

However, simply not taking pain medication is a real lose-lose situation. Dominik Mischkowski, co-author of the study, pointed out to USA Today,

Pain might actually decrease empathy as well. So, there are other factors that need to be taken into account.

179,Liver disease. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-discovered-what-could-be-a-significant-new-health-risk-from-travelling-in-space,"If humanity is ever going to realise its ambitions of travelling to Mars and elsewhere in the Solar System, one of the challenges we're going to have to address is how to stay healthy in space over long periods of time. NASA estimates it's going to take at least 150 days for humans to get to Mars, and that's a long time to be exposed to things like cosmic radiation without the benefits of Earth's protective magnetic field.

Unfortunately, some of the latest research on the effects of spending time in space doesn't have very positive findings. A recent study found that mice flown aboard the space shuttle Atlantis returned to Earth with the early signs of liver disease – and the animals were only off the planet for less than a fortnight.

After 13.5 days onboard the shuttle during its final flight in 2011, the mice were studied by a team of scientists including anaesthesiologist and physicist Karen Jonscher from the University of Colorado. The team found that even a short duration of spaceflight appeared to activate specialised liver cells that can induce scarring and cause long-term liver damage.

""Prior to this study we really didn't have much information on the impact of spaceflight on the liver,"" said Jonscher. ""We knew that astronauts often returned with diabetes-like symptoms, but they usually resolved quickly.""

Unlike other studies that have analysed the effects of cosmic radiation on mouse brains to see how exposure to space could impact the animals' cognitive abilities, the researchers don't think radiation is what caused the liver damage in this case.

The more likely culprit is the relative lack of gravity in a microgravity environment, which scientists think has a negative influence on the animals' metabolisms.

""We saw the beginning of nascent liver damage in just 13.5 days,"" said Jonscher. ""The mice also lost lean muscle mass. We have seen this same phenomenon in humans on bedrest – muscles atrophy and proteins break down into amino acids. The question is, how does that affect your liver?""

When the space-faring mice were compared with a control group that stayed on Earth, samples taken from the travellers indicated increased fat storage in their livers, along with lower levels of retinol – an animal form of Vitamin A – and changes to the levels of genes that help break down fats.

Taken together, these are all signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and potential early indicators of fibrosis. The most disturbing aspect of the findings, which are reported in PLOS ONE, is the rapid timeframe in which these symptoms developed in the animals.

""It generally takes a long time, months to years, to induce fibrosis in mice, even when eating an unhealthy diet,"" said Jonscher. ""If a mouse is showing nascent signs of fibrosis without a change in diet after 13.5 days, what is happening to the humans?""

While NASA is aware of some of the risks that altered gravity fields can have on the human body – listing it first on a rundown of factors that could impact our health in space – liver damage isn't one of the risks reported, indicating we may still have a lot to learn in this area.

Of course, one of the primary scientific goals of NASA astronaut Scott Kelly's famous 'year in space' was the unique opportunity to see what such a long-haul trip off the planet did to the human body – with Kelly's twin brother, former astronaut Mark Kelly, serving as an Earth-based control.

The most remarkable and immediate (and temporary) effect seen was Scott Kelly growing an astonishing 5 centimetres (2 inches) taller over the course of the year, due to the reduced gravity environment onboard the International Space Station – but NASA's ongoing research into the pair and their health will be long-lasting.

In the meantime, scientists will need to do a lot more research to gauge the potential of liver damage from space travel, both in mice and humans. And aside from any technological measures we can implement to try to reduce or mitigate the health risks of space, the researchers also acknowledge the situation might not be quite as stark as these early results suggest.

""Whether or not this is a problem is an open question,"" said Jonscher. ""We need to look at mice involved in longer duration space flight to see if there are compensatory mechanisms that come into play that might protect them from serious damage.""",2016-05-12 16:30:01

People size you up in seconds, but what exactly are they evaluating?

Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy has been studying first impressions alongside fellow psychologists Susan Fiske and Peter Glick for more than 15 years, and has discovered patterns in these interactions.

In her new book “Presence,” Cuddy says people quickly answer two questions when they first meet you:

Can I trust this person?

Can I respect this person?

Psychologists refer to these dimensions as warmth and competence respectively, and ideally you want to be perceived as having both.

Interestingly, Cuddy says that most people, especially in a professional context, believe that competence is the more important factor. After all, they want to prove that they are smart and talented enough to handle your business.

But in fact warmth, or trustworthiness, is the most important factor in how people evaluate you. “From an evolutionary perspective,” Cuddy says, “it is more crucial to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.” It makes sense when you consider that in cavemen days it was more important to figure out if your fellow man was going to murder you and steal all your possessions than if he was competent enough to build a good fire.

Cuddy’s new book explores how to feel more confident. Amazon

While competence is highly valued, Cuddy says it is evaluated only after trust is established. And focusing too much on displaying your strength can backfire.

Cuddy says MBA interns are often so concerned about coming across as smart and competent that it can lead them to skip social events, not ask for help, and generally come off as unapproachable. These overachievers are in for a rude awakening when they don’t get the job offer because nobody got to know and trust them as people.

“If someone you’re trying to influence doesn’t trust you, you’re not going to get very far; in fact, you might even elicit suspicion because you come across as manipulative,” Cuddy says. “A warm, trustworthy person who is also strong elicits admiration, but only after you’ve established trust does your strength become a gift rather than a threat.”

181,"Sleep to ""Prune"" unused or ineffective synapses. ",http://www.fastcompany.com/3059634/your-most-productive-self/your-brain-has-a-delete-button-heres-how-to-use-it,"There’s an old saying in neuroscience: neurons that fire together wire together. This means the more you run a neuro-circuit in your brain, the stronger that circuit becomes. This is why, to quote another old saw, practice makes perfect. The more you practice piano, or speaking a language, or juggling, the stronger those circuits get.

The ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. For years this has been the focus for learning new things. But as it turns out, the ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. Even more important is our ability to break down the old ones. It’s called “synaptic pruning.” Here’s how it works. Your Brain’s Delete Button And How to Use It Your Brain Is Like A Garden Imagine your brain is a garden, except instead of growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables, you grow synaptic connections between neurons. These are the connections that neurotransmitters like dopamine, seratonin, and others travel across. “Glial cells” are the gardeners of your brain–they act to speed up signals between certain neurons. But other glial cells are the waste removers, pulling up weeds, killing pests, raking up dead leaves. Your brain’s pruning gardeners are called “microglial cells.” They prune your synaptic connections. The question is, how do they know which ones to prune?

Researchers are just starting to unravel this mystery, but what they do know is the synaptic connections that get used less get marked by a protein, C1q (as well as others). When the microglial cells detect that mark, they bond to the protein and destroy–or prune–the synapse. This is how your brain makes the physical space for you to build new and stronger connections so you can learn more. Why Sleep Matters Have you ever felt like your brain is full? Maybe when starting a new job, or deep in a project. You’re not sleeping enough, even though you’re constantly taking in new information. Well, in a way, your brain actually is full.

When you learn lots of new things, your brain builds connections, but they’re inefficient, ad hoc connections. Your brain needs to prune a lot of those connections away and build more streamlined, efficient pathways. It does that when we sleep. Your brain cleans itself out when you sleep–your brain cells shrinking by up to 60% to create space for your glial gardeners to come in take away the waste and prune the synapses. Have you ever woken up from a good night’s rest and been able to think clearly and quickly? That’s because all the pruning and pathway-efficiency that took place overnight has left you with lots of room to take in and synthesize new information–in other words, to learn.

Thinking with a sleep-deprived brain is like hacking your way through a dense jungle with a machete. Its overgrown, slow going, exhausting. This is the same reason naps are so beneficial to your cognitive abilities. A 10- or 20-minute nap gives your microglial gardeners the chance to come in, clear away some unused connections, and leave space to grow new ones. Thinking with a sleep-deprived brain is like hacking your way through a dense jungle with a machete. It’s overgrown, slow-going, exhausting. The paths overlap, and light can’t get through. Thinking on a well-rested brain is like wandering happily through Central Park; the paths are clear and connect to one another at distinct spots, the trees are in place, you can see far ahead of you. It’s invigorating. Be Mindful Of What You’re Mindful Of And in fact, you actually have some control over what your brain decides to delete while you sleep. It’s the synaptic connections you don’t use that get marked for recycling. The ones you do use are the ones that get watered and oxygenated. So be mindful of what you’re thinking about.

182,"The discovery of 1,284 confirmed exoplanets. ",https://bit.ly/1T9twP8,"As NASA readied to announce new information about the organization’s planet-hunting division, many of us wondered if we were going to hear the words, “We are not alone in this universe.” We did not. During a live audio conference, Kepler mission researchers announced the discovery of 1,284 confirmed exoplanets as part of a recent study—the most every announced at one time.

Since the Kepler Space telescope launched back in 2009, it’s mission has been to seek out possible habitable planets. If we are to become a space-faring species, we have to find Earth-like planets beyond our own solar system. Since its launch, Kepler has been watching 150,000 stars to find these possible habitable planets.

This star chart illustrates the patch of sky Kepler has been staring at for the past few years. It’s field of view occupies 100 square degrees of our galaxy.

The work of these scientists uses “astrophysical false positive probability calculations for every Kepler Object of Interest.” The 1,284 planets that have been validated as exoplanets through this method and no other. They determine, using these calculations, 1 percent of the 1,284 verified planets will be false-positives.

“Planet candidates can be thought of like bread crumbs,” said Timothy Morton, associate research scholar at Princeton University in New Jersey. “If you drop a few large crumbs on the floor, you can pick them up one by one. But, if you spill a whole bag of tiny crumbs, you’re going to need a broom. This statistical analysis is our broom.”

This method may help unlock Kepler’s full potential, cutting down the busy-work of examining anomalies that may not even be planets.

Kepler’s mission is to detect planets in that Goldilocks Zone. It examines the transit of planets across distant stars, which gives researchers an idea of the candidates ability to how life based on its orbit and size. While there’s so much more information to judge the “habitablility” of a planet, this is what Kepler is able to measure.

Future telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will be able to give researcher more information about distant planets. It will allow researchers to assess whether a planet is habitable or not based on atmospheric composition.

It’s nice to think that mapping out our galaxy may help us build a road map for future space-faring generations.

Stephen Petranek, a journalist and author of a new book titled How We’ll Live on Mars, agrees. He says we must become a space-faring society. Mars is the first step, a step that won’t be without its challenges, but a necessary one that will better prepare us.

183,The part of the brain associated with inhibition quiets down. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/something-weird-happens-to-your-brain-when-you-start-improvising,"The best musicians are somehow able to come up with a song or piece of music on the fly that no one has ever heard before. They just let the music flow, riffing off something that exists and creating something new.

That's what we call creative genius. But where does this improvisational ability come from? Charles Limb, a music-obsessed otolaryngologist and surgeon, wanted to know exactly that.

Over the past few years, he's put jazz musicans and rappers into MRI machines to see what's happening in their brain as they freestyle and improvise.

Results showed that when someone is creating something new, parts of the brain associated with self-expression (language and at times, especially while freestyle rapping, parts associated with visual imagery) are highly active.

At the same time, and perhaps more interestingly, another part of the brain associated with inhibition quiets down. At a TEDx talk in 2010, he said it looks like it does this ""so that you're not inhibited, so that you're willing to make mistakes, so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses"".

Below is a graphic from Limb's studies that shows that while improvising, areas of the brain involved in self-monitoring – the sort of thing that might stop creativity – quiet down (those are blue); while areas of the brain connected to expression and language become very active (in red).

TED

It's important to be cautious about research like this, as Limb notes, because we're just scratching the surface here. We know very little about how the brain works. Plus, images of what's happening in the brain – as fascinating as they are – are still a sort of observational science. We see something that's happening but don't know what's driving it and certainly can't manipulate it yet, flipping a creative switch.

But this is a start to understanding what creativity looks like.

To first look at what was happening as a jazz musician came up with something new, Limb had six musicians go through a set of steps. First he had them play scales, then improvise on them. Then they played a memoriSed piece of music, and finally an improvised version of that – all while inside an MRI scanner.

But they were up to the challenge. And all showed similar results while improvising – a dampening of parts of the brain associated with inhibition and an increase in activity associated with self expression.

Here's another graphic showing the way that brain activity changed. Blue is a decrease in activity, red is an increase:

TED

When Limb first published his research on the topic, co-author Allen Braun noted the similarities between the brains of improvisers and the brains of people in REM sleep – while they were dreaming.

""It's tantalising to think some connection exists between improvisation and dreaming, which are both spontaneous events. These musicians may in fact be in a waking dream,"" Braun told Hopkins Medicine.

Limb has followed this up with other research since then. He's shown that while improvising with partners, musicians' language centres in the brain are highly active, lending support to the idea that their music may actually be understood by the brain as a 'language' on its own.

More than anything else, it's fascinating to start to look at what creativity is on a neurological level. After all, the brain is perhaps the greatest unexplored frontier in understanding how people work.

We've mapped the human genome but are still trying to understand the massive network of neurons and glial cells beneath our skull. Concepts like creativity – the ability to make a mental leap and come up with something new – are even more mysterious.

""We know very little about how we are able to be creative,"" Limb says in the TED talk. But as he told Hopkins Medicine before, creativity is a fundamental part of humanity.

""Without this type of creativity, humans wouldn't have advanced as a species,"" says Limb. ""It's an integral part of who we are.""
