But take a closer look at the picture. You'll be shocked when you see it!

They make a huge mess and are a total waste of deliciousness, but cake smashes are unarguably always adorable. That’s why when this mom of multiples decided to do one for her daughters’ first birthdays, she wanted to make it extra special.

UK mom Lara Mason recently posted photos on Facebook showing off her awesome cake smash photoshoot starring her twin daughters, Lyla and Lily. Yep, you read that correctly. Her daughters are twins, not quadruplets.

Now, it’s totally cool if you’re a little confused. We were too. But take a closer look at the picture and you’ll notice the two babies in the middle aren’t babies at all—they’re cakes.

In addition to being a mom, Mason also owns her own bakery where she makes fun customized cakes like the ones you’ve seen on the Food Network and TLC. With her daughters’ birthdays approaching, she decided to go big and make cake versions of her baby girls. “Not a lot of other people do this crazy thing that I do so I thought to myself… Why not?!” she wrote in her Facebook post. “I mean, what other kids get to say that their mum made them life-size cakes of themselves for their 1st birthday!?” Take a look at the video she posted along side her photos:

The twins with their Cake twins! Posted by Lara Mason Cake Art on Thursday, February 15, 2018

Now, we’ve seen a lot of those cake shows, so we know that making cake people look even somewhat realistic is a super tall order. And because they were her own children, Mason made sure to put extra special care into making these cake figures. “The cakes have taken a fair few hours—I’d say about 100 to 120 hours over the last few weeks,” Mason told the Motherload. “It’s the most critical I have ever been while making ‘cake people’ because I feel like I did such a good job making them so cute in the first place!”

Props to you, Lara Mason. You had a vision and you went for it. We just have one question: Did you and your family eat the cake babies? Because we’re thinking that might be pretty weird.

1,No. #stopclickbait,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hand-sanitizer-explodes-hot-car/,"Editor’s note: Fire experts warn that a plastic bottle containing any liquid — including, but not limited to, hand sanitizer — left in a car and exposed to direct sunlight can potentially focus sunlight into a beam hot enough to start a fire. The following article deals specifically with the specific claim that hand sanitizer will “spontaneously combust” if left in a hot car.

In April 2020, a series of photographs started to circulate on WhatsApp and Telegram that supposedly showed the aftermath of a car fire caused by an unattended bottle of hand sanitizer.

These posts, many of which were written in Portuguese, urged people to be cautious about leaving hand sanitizer in their cars because, they claimed, it can spontaneously combust.

A month or so after these posts went viral in Brazil, a similar rumor started to circulate on English-language pages. In addition to being spread by anonymous social media users, these warnings also made their way onto the pages of a real fire departments. The Western Lakes Fire District of Wisconsin (WLFD) in Wisconsin, for instance, shared the following post to its Facebook page on May 21:

Soon after, a number of news outlets picked up on this story and ran articles about how a fire department was warning people not to leave hand sanitizer in their cars. Although WLFD truly did post the above-displayed warning, the department later removed the post for stirring confusion.

For starters, the picture has not been officially linked to a fire caused by a bottle of hand sanitizer exploding into flame. A number of experts have also weighed in to say that while hand sanitizer does contain alcohol and is flammable, it would require a tremendous amount of heat for spontaneous combustion. Although this sort of fire may be technically possible (more on that later), we’ve yet to see any official reports about a car fire starting this way. Lastly, the WLFD did state that a fire could be started via “magnification of light through the bottle,” but this is true for any plastic bottle and has little to do with its contents.

WLFD deleted its original hand sanitizer warning and replaced it with the following message:

Our goal in the WLFD is to provide timely, accurate, and educational information while responding to the needs of our customers. It’s become clear that a recent post about hand sanitizer was taken in many different directions from our original goal. We want to take the opportunity to clear up some misunderstandings and assure our position is understood. While we never made the claim that the photo utilized was from our district or from an exploding container of hand sanitizer, it has become clear that that inference and speculation made is seem as though it was. It was to illustrate a door fire resulting from contact with open flame which was the center of our post. Our message was intended to center on preventing fire or injury from the use of hand sanitizer. It also regarded the past history of issues stemming from clear bottles being stored in vehicles. These bottles typically store bottled water or as of late; hand sanitizer. While infrequent, there have been cases in the recent past were reflecting light placed through a clear bottle was able to focus onto a combustible surface and cause a fire. This has primarily been through water bottles but since hand sanitizer is often stored in the same vessel we wanted to pass it along for your safety. The principle is identical and obviously an additional issue would occur if it happened in the presence of an alcohol based product. The open flame comment was to remind people that when hand sanitizer is wet on any surface it will ignite when exposed to flame. With the recent increase in utilization of this product we wanted to remind our customers that it’s important not to allow this to occur. Many people have been sequestered in their homes and with an upcoming holiday accompanied with nice weather we knew grilling, fire pits, and other enjoyments would be in place. While we never referenced grilling in one’s vehicle, we did center on smoking and wanted to assure that the correlation was made illustrating that is also an open flame. We didn’t want anyone injured exercising good hygiene practices and then unintentionally coming in contact with open flame. Video representation of this happening is included for our fans to watch. We simply want our customers to be happy healthy and well and most importantly enjoy the time they have together with family and friends. Our message quickly came became misconstrued and we wanted to assure that we made it right. We apologize for any confusion and wish you an enjoyable holiday weekend.

Judging from the amount of mail Snopes received, many people were still confused about what dangers may lurk in bottles of hand sanitizer. So let’s take a closer look at the questions this viral post sparked.

Is Hand Sanitizer Flammable?

Many hand sanitizers contain alcohol, and these alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) are flammable. The Federal Aviation Administration wrote in a 2010 report:

As expected, hand sanitizer is flammable and can easily be ignited with a common grill lighter when poured into a pan. It tends to burn relatively cool, compared to fuel, plastic, or cellulose fires with peak flame temperatures between 500° and 1000°F. The observed temperatures above the flame were higher for the liquid hand sanitizer compared to the gel.

Hand sanitizers also give off vapors, and these vapors are also flammable.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes:

ABHS contains ethyl alcohol, which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor, and is considered a flammable liquid. Although the incidence of fires related to ABHS is very low, it is vital that ABHS is stored safely and that bulk dispensers are installed and maintained correctly.

Can Hand Sanitizer Spontaneously Combust?

One of the major fears that people had after encountering this rumor on social media was that their hand sanitizer was going to “spontaneously combust” if left too long in a hot car. We won’t say that this is impossible, but we will say that it is extremely unlikely.

According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), hand sanitizer would have to be exposed to extreme heats (over 700 degrees Fahrenheit) in order to spontaneously combust.

Spontaneous ignition, on the other hand, involves a substance self-heating to a point where it ignites, without the need for any outside ignition source like a flame. Hand sanitizer is not subject to self-heating and would require temperatures to reach over 700 degrees Fahrenheit to spontaneously ignite, according to Guy Colonna, director of Technical Services at NFPA.

Those sort of temperatures just aren’t going to be seen inside of a parked car (so long as that car is parked on Earth). A 2018 study published in the journal Temperature found that the average temperature in a parked car on a 95-degree day was about 116 degrees. Specific parts of the car, such as the dashboard, climbed closer to 160 degrees, but that is still far from the 700 degrees needed for spontaneous combustion.

The NFPA continued:

“Spontaneous ignition would be an ignition source independent of a flame or a spark, [and] it requires a material that is reactive to do what’s called self-heat,” Colonna says in a new video interview on the topic (above). “Internally, it undergoes a reaction and changes its properties, and when changing its properties, it releases lots of heat energy. Hand sanitizer, the alcohol [in it], is a material not inclined to do that. … The ignition temperature of the alcohols are going to be something in excess of 700 degrees Fahrenheit.” In other words, while hand sanitizer gives off ignitable vapors at roughly room temperature or above, that vapor-air mixture still needs to be exposed to very high temperatures to ignite. A flame can do it. A hot car can’t.

Can a Bottle of Hand Sanitizer Focus Sunlight into a Strong Enough Heat Source to Start a Fire?

This claim has more to do with the magnification properties of plastic bottles than it does with the contents of said bottles. In fact, in 2017, a similar warning was circulated on social media that said leaving a water bottle in your car on a hot day could result in a fire.

Live Science wrote:

Leaving a water bottle sitting in your car sounds benign enough. But on a hot, summer day, the plastic can act as a lens, focusing light into a high-energy beam that’s intense enough to burn material like car-seat upholstery. […] “The water bottle is acting like a lens that’s focusing the light coming through the window,” Odile Madden, a materials scientist at the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles, told Live Science. Light consists of numerous photons, which are subatomic particles that travel in a straight line, Madden said. Eyeglass and microscope lenses direct the photons so they converge on a point. “You can use that to see something better, get it in focus. Or, you can focus a lot of light onto a very small point and concentrate all that energy, and that can cause melting and burning,” Madden explained.

Although it is technically possible for a fire to start in this manner, again, it is very unlikely. The sun, the bottle, and a flammable source would all have to be in perfect alignment on a rather hot day to ignite a fire.

In June 2020, Illinois’ Waukegan Fire Department reported that a small bottle of hand sanitizer had started a car fire. The organization later amended their statement to clarify that the fire was started in the manner described above — a plastic bottle focusing direct sunlight into beam hot enough to start a fire — so its cause was unrelated to the substance in the bottle.

All Smoke and No Flame?

The claim that hand sanitizer was causing car fires first gained traction in Brazil in April 2020 via social media posts on WhatsApp. This spurred the country’s Corpo de Bombeiros de Campo Grande (Campo Grande Fire Department) to issue a warning about the potential dangers of leaving hand sanitizer in a hot car. However, the fire department admitted that it had yet to see any fires caused in such a manner. Likewise, we have yet to uncover any confirmed reports about hand sanitizer causing a fire while left in a parked car on a hot day.

However, many hand sanitizers are still flammable and do pose some risks. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should not be used near open flames, and people storing large amounts of hand sanitizer should adhere to the National Fire Protection Association’s Flammable and Combustible Liquids code.

Although keeping a small bottle of hand sanitizer in your car won’t result in spontaneous combustion, cautious drivers may want to store their hand sanitizer (and any other liquids kept in plastic bottles) out of direct sunlight in their glove boxes or center consoles.",2020-05-22 19:03:32

4,...and there it is. ,http://www.boredpanda.com/perfect-kingfisher-dive-photo-wildlife-photography-alan-mcfadyen/,"Alan McFadyen, who has been an avid wildlife photographer since 2009, just captured a perfectly timed photo that he has spent six years trying to get. By his count, it took him 4,200 hours and 720,000 photos to get a perfect shot of a Kingfisher diving straight into the water without a single splash.

“The photo I was going for of the perfect dive, flawlessly straight, with no splash required not only me to be in the right place and get a fortunate shot but also for the bird itself to get it perfect,” McFadyen told The Herald Scotland. “I would often go and take 600 pictures in a session, and not a single one of them be any good. However, looking back on the thousands and thousands of photos I have taken to get this one image, it makes me realize just how much work I have done to get it.”

The common kingfisher is mostly known for his very bright plumage, that is quite atypical for birds living in colder climates. The bird usually lives near bodies of water and catches their prey by diving.

McFadyen, who also runs a wildlife photography side business, was inspired to love nature and wildlife by his grandfather. “I remember my grandfather taking me to see the kingfisher nest, and I remember being completely blown away by how magnificent the birds are. So when I took up photography, I returned to this same spot to photograph the kingfishers.”

“I never really stopped to think about how long it was taking along the way as I enjoyed doing it but now I look back on it I’m really proud of the picture and the work I put in.”

“I remember my grandfather taking me to see the kingfisher nest, and I just remember being completely blown away by how magnificent the birds are”

Case in point: While you've been tidying up your home for spring, she's been doing the same exact thing at her Waco farmhouse. Luckily for us, the designer dished her best spring cleaning tip in a recent blog post.

According to Joanna, giving your home a good deep clean isn't just about sprucing up: The best thing you can do is identify things you don't need anymore and throw them away for good.

""I can't stress this enough—your whole family will feel the benefits of rooms and spaces that can breathe, so before you even start the cleaning, get five trash bags and start filling them with items your family has outgrown or no longer needs,"" wrote Joanna. ""If you don't love it, toss it.""

Considering Chip doesn't go to an antiques shop without buying something, well, odd, we can only imagine how he feels about this.

7,Calling someone you're close to by the name of someone else you're close to is actually a sign that you care for them dearly. #Stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/life/a42323/scientific-reason-why-moms-mess-up-their-kids-names/?src=socialflowFB,"How often, while you were growing up, did your mom call you by your sibling's name? And how often do you find yourself doing the same now? This is a weird phenomenon, because you'd associate forgetfulness with unfamiliarity — and that's definitely not something you could accuse mothers of.

But misnaming isn't a result of poor memory, frazzled mom syndrome, the two people looking alike, the similarity of the names that are confused and misused, or even because they're straight up not that important to you.

This content is imported from Giphy. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

Sorry, Ron Swanson. You're way off base here.

Misnaming is actually a sign of love. Calling someone you're close to by the name of someone else you're close to is actually a sign that you care for them dearly, according to an investigation published in the journalMemory & Cognition.

The researchers (all current or former members of the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University) conducted five studies and spoke with over 1,700 participants to examine the so-called ""misnaming phenomenon"" among familiar individuals. They reached their conclusion after observing that misnaming typically happens ""within a social group."" With moms, this means that they typically call their child by their sibling's name – not the name of a random kid down the block who sorta looks like them, or someone they saw on TV.

This is thanks to the way our minds store people's names and information about them, according to the report. The brain uses a ""semantic network"" (essentially, a filing system) where similar or related information is stored ""next to"" each other. So when your brain is looking for your firstborn Tommy's name so you can holler at him to put away his laundry, it might accidentally pull the wrong ""file"" from the ""family folder"" and out comes your other son Joey's name.

Of course, this phenomenon isn't exclusive to parents. The researchers even cite one of the most infamous pop culture examples of misnaming – Ross saying Rachel instead of Emily during his wedding vows in Friends.

So don't worry, your #mombrain is failing you if you can't keep your kids' or friends' names straight. ""It's a normal cognitive glitch,"" researcher Samantha Deffler assured NPR during a January interview about the study. Deffler, too, reported that her own mother used to mess up her siblings' names – with even the family dog's name thrown in. Gotta love those fur babies.

9,Approximately 75% of the photos in the catalogue are actually CGI (Computer Generated Images). #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/shopping/a5719/ikea-catalog-cgi/?src=socialflowFB,"Media Platforms Design Team

When you open a fashion brand's catalog or shop for a new dress online, you probably assume that the models wearing the clothes don't look like that in real life. Photoshop is everywhere in fashion (and sometimes it's rather egregious), but did you know that the images you see in furniture catalogs might also not be what they seem?

Recently, IKEA revealed that 75% of the photos in its catalog are actually CGI, meaning they've been produced not on a set with real furniture, but at a desk on a computer.

At first hearing this, we couldn't believe all those cozy, well-designed rooms didn't really exist. But IKEA says that producing their catalog digitally is more efficient and eco-friendly, as they don't have to build sets and transport furniture that would ultimately be discarded.

""The most expensive and complicated things we have to create and shoot are kitchens,"" Martin Enthed, an IKEA IT manager, told CG Society. ""From both an environmental and time point of view, we don't want to have to ship in all those white-goods from everywhere, shoot them and then ship them all back again. And unfortunately, kitchens are one of those rooms that differ very much depending on where you are in the world. A kitchen in the US will look very different to a kitchen in Japan, for example, or in Germany. So you need lots of different layouts in order to localise the kitchen area in brochures.""

But wary consumers need not get up in arms. Enthed also stresses that he knows it's important for shoppers to know exactly what they're getting when they buy furniture, so his team takes painstaking steps to mimic the real-life product as best they can.

10,PCOS (Polycycstic Ovarian Syndrome). There is no one symptom which is a direct indication of it. #stopclickbait,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-facts,"Usually the script is simple when you’re sick: You feel crummy. You go to the doctor. A test reveals the issue at hand. But that’s not the sitch with all health conditions. Case in point: polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

While PCOS is classically associated with irregular cycles or missed periods, it’s also easy to miss: Maybe you blame your crazy cycle on other factors. Or, because PCOS is categorized by a slew of signs and symptoms (and isn’t diagnosed by one test), it might even go unnoticed. In fact, less than 50 percent of women with PCOS know they have it, according the PCOS Foundation. But it’s actually a fairly common ovulation issue. Between five and 10 percent of menstruating young women have it, says Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine. Here’s what you need to know about the disorder:

There’s a Group of Symptoms

Just like there's no one test to diagnose PCOS, there’s no one symptom that signifies its presence. Irregular or absent periods can be a sign. Acne, excessive hair (a.k.a. hirsutism, which is when you develop hair in so-called male pattern areas), infertility, and weight gain are also all linked with PCOS, says Mamta Mamik, M.D., an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive science at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. So are metabolic issues like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and even diabetes.

If any of this sounds familiar, check in with your gynecologist, suggests Minkin. Many times, docs will order blood tests to look for wonky levels of sex hormones, like too much testosterone, she says. Your ovaries and adrenal glands make testosterone normally, but if you have PCOS, you make increased amounts. You might also have abnormal glucose levels, she says.

...But Cysts Aren’t Everything

Despite its name, not all women with PCOS have cysts on their ovaries, says Mamik. If you do have cysts, they’re often described as a string of pearls—and if they burst, it can be super-painful. The cysts are sometimes a result of a woman's eggs not being released over time, and can be ID'd through an ultrasound.

It’s a Weighty Matter

PCOS may be genetic, says Mamik. Some research suggests if your mom has it, there’s a 50 percent chance you could, too. But the condition is also associated with being overweight, says Minkin. “One of the conundrums is whether or not you develop PCOS and then gain weight or gain weight and then develop PCOS,” she says. “Probably, both can happen.” If you do have PCOS and are overweight, a weight loss plan (good nutrition and an exercise program) is vital, says Minkin. “Weight loss really helps to normalize the abnormalities,” she says.

Treatment Options Vary

Here’s the good news: “In general, the treatment is quite straightforward,” says Minkin. Beyond addressing any underlying conditions like blood sugar abnormalities or diabetes, your course of action generally depends on where you are in life. If you’re not trying to get pregnant, the easiest remedy is usually the Pill. Oral contraception takes control of your ovaries, forcing them to stop making excess testosterone and controls your periods, says Minkin.

See a baby in the near future? While PCOS can be linked with trouble conceiving, it doesn't mean you’ll never be able to get knocked up, says Mamik. A gynecologist can start you on a medication called Clomid, which gets you ovulating. “Success rates are quite high,” says Minkin. Ultimately, everyone is different, and your ob-gyn can help you come up with the best plan for you based on your medical history and condition.

11,"The ages which end a decade - 29, 39, 49, with 39 being the largest offending age. #stopclickbait",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-are-people-more-likely-to-cheat-at-age-29_us_57a9f9e6e4b0ba7ed23d87a7,"WANDER WOMEN COLLECTIVE via Getty Images There is some research to suggest that, in general, people behave differently when they approach a new decade in their age.

The idea that the person you love is betraying your trust and engaging in intimate rendezvous with someone else is emotionally devastating. It’s only natural to look for patterns and warning signs to avoid being cheated on.

Now, a new report suggests that people are twice as likely to cheat at the “danger age” of 39, and are also more likely to have affairs during the last years of other decades — for example, at age 29 or 49 — than at other times. The findings come from research done by the U.K.-based website IllicitEncounters.com, and were first reported by The Sun.

Do other studies of infidelity back up this claim?

There is some research to suggest that, in general, people behave differently when they approach a new decade in their age. In 2014, researchers Adam L. Alter and Hal E. Hershfield at New York University and the University of California, Los Angeles, respectively, performed six studies to investigate the behaviors of adults during their “9-ending ages” (ages 29, 39, 49, etc.), including their propensity for extramarital affairs. The researchers obtained data from an online dating site similar to Illicit Encounters, where users are already in supposedly monogamous relationships. [I Don’t: 5 Myths About Marriage]

Alter and Hershfield calculated the total number of male users on the site (8,077,820) and compared that to the number of 9-ender male users (952,176). They found there were 18 percent more 9-enders registered than there would be if the site’s users represented a completely random sample of ages.

Across the six studies, Alter and Hershfield also found that 9-enders reported being particularly preoccupied with aging, and were more likely to wonder whether their lives were meaningful.

This could lead to a rise in behaviors that “suggest a search for, or a crisis of meaning,” such as an affair, the researchers said.

In general, infidelity is difficult to study because it’s challenging for researchers to find willing participants and to gather accurate reports, and cheating itself is defined inconsistently across relationships, said Christin Munsch, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut, who was not affiliated with the Illicit Encounters research but does study infidelity.

The Illicit Encounters’ research may not be unbiased: the company is financially backing the study, methods were not vetted by outside experts, and it was not peer-reviewed.

Munsch said that the findings of the Illicit Encounters study could just suggest that people looking to have affairs might not be honest about their age in their profiles. [How Do I Love Thee? Experts Count 8 Ways]

However, in their research, Alter and Hershfield looked at how people on dating sites might approach lying about their age. They asked users to imagine they were trying to fool a potential date into believing they were as young as possible while remaining within the bounds of plausibility. Their data suggested that the most frequent responses were ages ending in 5.

While these aren’t definitive findings, they suggest that a lying 30-year-old is more likely to say they’re 25 than 29.

In her own research, Munsch looked at data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), an anonymous, nationally representative survey of people born between 1980 and 1984 that was conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor. She compared people’s marital status with their responses to questions about whether they had multiple sex partners in the past year, and whether they had had sex with a stranger. Anyone who was married and answered yes to these questions was coded as unfaithful.

She found that for both men and women, being economically dependent (making less money than your spouse) was correlated to increased rates of cheating.

“The less money you make relative to your spouse, the more likely you are to cheat. We compare ourselves: you don’t want to see yourself coming out on the losing end,” Munsch told Live Science.

In 2012, Munsch reviewed the literature for trends surrounding infidelity. With regards to age, she found that as people get older they are more likely to cheat, and that may be because there are simply more opportunities to be unfaithful.

Munsch said that for men, being economically dependent may be worse because they may feel expected by society to be breadwinners. Cheating can be a way for men to simultaneously bolster their masculinity and get back at their breadwinner wives. [Busted! 6 Gender Myths in the Bedroom & Beyond]

According to Munsch, the recipe for avoiding an affair is pretty simple.

“From a sociological perspective, one of the biggest predictors of infidelity is opportunity. If I’m trying to lose weight, I don’t keep cookies in the house. The same principle applies here. If you’re looking for a ‘magic bullet,’ don’t be in the situation” where cheating could happen.

And although it’s tempting try to analyze data to predict who will cheat, putting the results in perspective is important, she said. For example, her research showed that the likelihood of infidelity jumps from around 5 percent for men whose wives make equal financial contributions to 15 percent for men who are economically dependent on their wives.

“That’s three times more likely. But 85 percent of men [who are dependent on their wives] aren’t cheating,” she said.

Ultimately, many variables factor into infidelity. Munsch said that there are certain psychological traits that are correlated to cheating, such as extreme risk-taking behavior or low morality, and that people’s environment also plays a role. If a person with certain traits gets placed in a situation of high opportunity, that can be a good indicator that infidelity will take place.

But by the same token, a person with all the necessary predispositions can be put in an ideal circumstance to cheat and still not do it.

Munsch said that the “9-ending ages” theory is “certainly plausible,” but that predicting any complex human behaviorremains an inexact science.

12,Atopic dermatitis is a form of eczema which affects babies and can cause complications later in life such as sleep problems and allergies. Moisturizing babies with Vaseline would (likely) solve the problem. #stopclickbait,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vaseline-cheap-eczema-prevention_us_584afad3e4b04c8e2bafb25b,"On the surface, eczema may seem like an ailment that is more annoying than debilitating. But for the more than 20 percent of kids who struggle with it, the effects can be more severe ― and costly (really costly) for their parents.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common form of eczema, and tends to develop in infants. It can be either lifelong and chronic or go away on its own over time, and is linked to hay fever, asthma, allergies, sleep problems and weight problems. Data suggests families caring for a child with this type of eczema spend as much as 35 percent of their discretionary income on care each month. Estimates put the total cost of eczema care in the U.S. at up to $3.8 billion per year.

Now, new research suggests that a solution under $10 might be able to help prevent the condition from developing in the first place. The fix? Moisturizing newborns with petroleum jelly until they are six months old.

“We could really save a lot of newborns ― and save families ― a lot of suffering,” researcher Dr. Steve Xu, a resident physician in the department of dermatology at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, told The Huffington Post.

“It’s also a pretty good deal in terms of cost,” he said.

Xu and his team built on a 2014 study of 124 babies, in which researchers from Oregon Health & Science University found that parents cut their newborns’ risk of atopic dermatitis in half when they moisturized them daily (or at least 5 times a week, everywhere but the scalp) for their first six months of life. The parents in the study used either an over-the-counter drugstore ointment, moisturizing cream or sunflower seed oil, all of which provided a similar benefit in terms of preventing eczema.

In a follow up analysis of the research, Xu and his colleagues looked at cost and determined that using a daily moisturizer for a baby’s first six months was cheap ― way cheaper than the costs of dealing with eczema if it develops later on.

A six-month supply of Vaseline petroleum jelly was just $7.30, the cheapest of all the moisturizers in the analysis. And the total cost for the most expensive moisturizer, Vaniply ointment, was $173.39 for a six-month supply.

“We added the economic argument why prophylactic moisturizing is a really really great idea,” Xu said.

There are still a lot of unanswered questions about eczema

Moisturizers are a big part of the way eczema is treated, but until now they haven’t necessarily been used to prevent the problem. The evidence is still unclear as to how they actually help thwart the condition ― in a big part because the evidence is still unclear about what exactly causes atopic dermatitis in the first place ― and why individuals who have it are so likely to go on to develop allergies, hay fever and asthma.

The researchers suspect using moisturizers during infancy helps correct outer-layer skin defects in babies who will go on to develop eczema. Those defects are thought to play a role in how the condition actually develops, along with hereditary and environmental factors, too.

Whether or not preventing eczema would also prevent the allergies, hay fever and asthma that come along with it is yet another unsolved question. But there’s a growing body of data that suggests that atopic dermatitis does in fact makes individuals more susceptible these comorbidities, which some doctors refer to as the “atopic march.”

Vaseline petroleum jelly is one of the moisturizers recommended for the treatment of eczema by the National Eczema Association, though not as a prophylactic treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends petroleum jelly as one of the top choice moisturizers for treating (not necessarily preventing) eczema, including atopic dermatitis, because it’s among the most moisturizing.

Plus, it’s safe, Xu said. Petroleum jelly is fragrance-free and doesn’t have preservatives or additives that could potentially cause irritation or other allergies, he added. That said, some people may still avoid it for political or environmental reasons: Petroleum jelly is actually a byproduct of the oil refining process.

Sunflower seed oil was the second cheapest moisturizer in the study, costing $18.25 for six months of using it daily on a newborn, and may be a solid choice for those who want to avoid petroleum jelly.

Not all infants need a daily moisturizer

Ready to slather your infant with Vaseline tonight? Not without talking to your pediatrician first, Xu said.

It’s important to note that the initial study only included babies who were already considered high-risk of developing atopic dermatitis: They each had a parent or sibling who had at some point been diagnosed with eczema, asthma or hay fever.

Larger studies with longer follow-up are still needed ― and are currently ongoing ― to confirm that the method continues to prevent atopic dermatitis in babies who were moisturized beyond the first six months of their lives. But at this point, the data is encouraging, since nearly half of all individuals who develop eczema do so in the first year of their lives, Xu said.

So far, the research only suggests that using a daily moisturizer on newborns could be a good idea for babies at high risk. The risk of trying this intervention is low, even if it ultimately doesn’t prevent atopic dermatitis.

“Gentle, bland moisturizers have very little to no risk of harm to newborns,” Xu said, adding it’s definitely reasonable for parents with infants who are at high risk of developing atopic dermatitis to ask their pediatricians about using a moisturizer as a preventative measure.

And at just more than $7 for the full six months of petroleum jelly, it’s not that expensive to do.",2017-03-11 09:35:00
13,The clothes go through a cycle: 1 - Goodwill Store. 2 - Goodwill outlet. 3 - Auction. 4 - Textile Recycler. #stopclickbait,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-does-goodwill-do-with-your-clothes_us_57e06b96e4b0071a6e092352,"Education Images via Getty Images

Giving away used clothes may sound simple: You drop them off at a donation center, and then they’re sold to somebody who can re-use them. Right?

Not quite. In reality, donated clothing often takes a much longer journey before meeting its ultimate fate. In the end, it may get re-sold. But it also may end up in the trash, joining the approximately 12.8 million tons of American textile waste that was sent to landfills during 2013. And that benefits no one.

Goodwill is one of the biggest U.S. landing points for donated clothes: Stores in New York and New Jersey alone collected more than 85.7 million pounds of textile donations last year, Jose Medellin, director of communications for Goodwill NY/NJ, told HuffPost. And his Goodwill region is just one of 164 regional Goodwill organizations across the U.S. and Canada.

As you’re probably starting to realize, it takes a ton of effort to guide your clothes from the Goodwill donation bin to their final resting place. Knowing how Goodwill works can help you make smarter decisions when deciding if another jeans purchase is really worth it for you, for the donations staff and for the environment.

Step 1: The Goodwill retail store

Goodwill operates more than 3,200 individual stores, Kyle Stewart, director of donated goods retail, told HuffPost. When you donate a bag of clothing at a store, workers most likely parse through it to determine what can be sold and what can’t: Wet or mildew-y clothes are eliminated, but everything else is fair game.

Ray Tellez, the vice president of retail operations for Goodwill Southern California, said stores in his region track how long each piece of clothing has been on the retail floor. If an item doesn’t sell within four weeks, it’s sent onward in the process.

Step 2: A Goodwill outlet

At these stores, “the goal is to liquidate,” he told HuffPost. “We want to try and keep as much out of the landfill as possible.”

Each regional Goodwill organization may go about this process slightly differently. You can contact your regional Goodwill headquarters to learn more.

Step 3: Auction

Whatever isn’t sold in outlets moves on to Goodwill auctions, live events where attendees bid on bins of donated items without knowing precisely what’s inside. An auction bin might sell for as low as $35, which is a stellar value, according to Tellez.

Step 4: Textile Recyclers

Then comes the big move: If clothes weren’t able to sell in those first three stages of the process, Goodwill sends them to textile recycling organizations, Stewart said.

S.M.A.R.T., for example, is a trade association whose independent member businesses work to recycle textiles. On average, 45 percent of clothing that makes it to S.M.A.R.T. is either re-sold into the U.S. used clothing industry or sent overseas into markets with more demand, spokesperson Kathy Walsh told HuffPost.

But this isn’t necessarily a good thing. Obviously, re-selling clothes into the U.S. secondhand market just encourages them to make the cycle all over again. And sending clothes overseas can majorly hinder the textile industries in developing countries, robbing locals of jobs and income.

Beyond that, 30 percent of donated clothes at S.M.A.R.T. get cut into rags for industrial use, and 20 percent is processed into a soft fiber filling for furniture, home insulation, car sound-proofing and more.

But what about landfills?

If S.M.A.R.T. recyclers find clothes that are wet, moldy or contaminated, they send them to landfills, Walsh said. The amount they send is small ― just five percent of all donations ― but it all adds up to the ridiculous amount of clothing waste in landfills nationwide.

According to Walsh, nearly 95 percent of all clothing waste could be reused and recycled. We just aren’t disposing of it properly.

For starters, you should never, ever throw your clothes in the garbage, Medellin says. Instead, take them to a Goodwill or other donation center. If they’re wet, moldy or otherwise hazardous, then contact your city’s sanitation department and ask how best to dispose of them.

Of course, the easiest way to prevent clothing waste is to avoid buying clothes you don’t need. Keep a clean closet, and a cleaner planet will be waiting for you later.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this post stated that Americans sent 12 million pounds of textile waste to landfills in 2013. In fact, the number is much higher, at approximately 12.8 million tons.

Anyone that has worn a button-front shirt has likely noticed that the buttons are different, depending on whether it’s a men or women’s shirt. Chances are you haven’t given it much thought, but as it turns out, there’s actually a pretty interesting story that explains why.

Today co-hosts Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie got to the bottom of things during the show’s “What’s Trending” segment Thursday. As it turns out, the different styles date all the way back to when buttons were invented, around the 13th century.

“Only wealthy women could afford to have buttons on their shirts, and if you were wealthy, you also had ladies maids. So having the buttons on the other side made sense, because it was someone else buttoning your clothes.”

15,September 16th. #stopclickbait,http://www.unilad.co.uk/viral/this-is-the-most-common-birthday-in-the-world/,"NBC

If like myself you’re forever forgetting friends and families birthdays then we’ve got a hot tip for you, make a note of September 16.

Why? Well according to Harvard University September 16 is the most common birthday in the world, so if you’ve got that in the diary chances are you’ll be remembering someone’s birthday.

Advert 10

In fact according to FamousBirthdays.com you’ll be celebrating the birth of Nick Jonas, BB King, Amy Poehler and Flor Rida amongst many, many others. Who knows it may also be a friend’s birthday?

To work this out scientists made a graph, called a heat map, which corresponded to the number of births on any given day with light and dark squares.

The graph then shows how birthdays rank against each other, with darker sections being more common and lighter being rarer.

Advert 10

The reason for this is that unsurprisingly birth rates in the summer and autumn tend to be more popular for births, while people seem to conceive children in the winter, presumably to keep warm.

Meanwhile a separate study from back in 2013 which examined 6,500 sperm samples found that male fertility increases in the winter and spring months which again leads to a higher summer birth rate.

Interestingly birthday’s become quite rare from the Christmas time until January 1. Of course February 29 is rare as well because it only comes around every 4 years.

16,"Dishes can break easily, and the sinks show a lot of dirt and scratches. #stopclickbait",http://www.countryliving.com/home-design/a40747/farmhouse-sinks-problems/,"Every country homeowner knows that no kitchen is complete without a farmhouse sink. They're both rustic and elegant, they provide plenty of room for washing dishes, and they're a Joanna Gaines must-have. But before you run off to install one, take note that they do come with a few complications.

Brittany Bailey, a North Carolina homeowner and the DIY guru behind the blog Pretty Handy Girl, is here to share the biggest problems she's experienced with her farmhouse sink, and her valid points are all factors to consider before getting one of your own. Here are both the problems (and the solutions!) you should know about.

1. You should expect some broken dishware. While accidents are bound to happen in any kitchen, you should anticipate a few more broken dishes than usual if you have a farmhouse sink, especially if it's made from cast iron, according to Brittany. They're designed to be extra durable and tough, which means they aren't very forgiving if you drop a glass or plate. The best solution for this is to invest in higher quality, ""break-resist"" dishes and glasses to avoid as many accidents as possible—or to simply be more cautious with your favorite pieces.

2. White sinks show much more dirt. While other sinks tend to mask grime and wear-and-tear, a white farmhouse sink is going to show it all. Be prepared to clean it more often, and opt for baking soda, which should make it look new again.

3. Scratches will be more noticeable too. If you love cooking with cast iron pans, then you should be even more cautious about this possible problem, Brittany writes. Over time, she's figured out the best way to clean up these scratch marks, which she shares onher blog. You can also opt for a sink grid to keep pots, pans, and other dirty items away from the bottom of your sink.

To see more of Brittany's best farmhouse sink tips head over to Pretty Handy Girl, and check out these other clever cleaning tips that will make your home sparkle.

17,Toast the oats in butter before hand. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a39877/how-make-oatmeal-taste-better-toast-butter/,"No one wakes up in the morning craving oatmeal. You deal with the pile of mush when you're trying to be healthy. Breakfast doesn't have to be this sad. One quick and easy step will seriously change the way you think about oats.

Toast the oats in butter! It's a trick I picked up from the cookbook Whole Grain Mornings . While Megan, the author, has oatmeal down to a science, you don't need a recipe.

Melt a tab of butter in a small saucepan, then throw in the oats. The magic ratio is one tablespoon butter to one cup oats—steel cut or old-fashioned. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the oats smell nutty and roasted. Once you hit that point, set the oats aside and proceed as normal. Bring the milk or water (or a mixture of both) to a simmer, add the oats and cook to your liking.

The world of difference one tablespoon of butter makes is incredible. It makes oatmeal actually taste rich and decadent. You won't even need brown sugar or sweetener! It's amazing on its own.

Try it with these super-delish oatmeal recipes:

18,Clothes & Tide Pods. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/shopping/a38784/dollar-store-manager/,"There seems to be an endless amount of curiosity surrounding dollar stores. And we get it—dollar stores are full of tremendous discounts you can't find anywhere else and helpful organization items (and yes, also some toxic products that scarred the bejeebers out of us!). But honestly, we've always wanted to know more. Like how is it possible to sell all those items so cheaply? And is that bargain-priced food actually safe to eat?

Well thanks to Brandon, a somewhat-secretive Dollar General manager and his recent Reddit post—where he did an ""ask me anything"" Q&A—we now know even more about the popular chains. Here's what we found most interesting about his insider information:

1. Dollar stores don't sell items that are faulty or broken—they're discounted for a different reason. ""I assume like any retailer the product is so cheap because it's bought in massive bulk quantities (DG has around 20,000 stores to supply),"" Brandon said. ""To be honest, most of the products that aren't food are made in China, so you can probably guess why it's cheap.""

2. But there's one precaution he recommends when buying food: ""It's always a good habit to check expiration dates in any store,"" he said, ""but you should be A-OK if the store team rotates the food.""

3. Yes, the stores are cheap, but the company is not. ""Normal starting pay for managers is 34-40k and is negotiable to some degree,"" Brandon explained. ""I'm in that range. I know another manager that's been with Dollar General for 15 years and gets paid 80k. Your pay depends on the size of the store you manage, location, and time with the company. You also get bonuses but I split those with my crew.""

4. And the company seems pretty strict. In fact, you can get fired on the spot for something seemingly harmless. When asked if he ever lost his keys, he replied, ""If you lose your keys you get fired instantly, so thankfully no.""

5. The unofficial biggest seller may (or may not) surprise you. ""The biggest steady seller for a single item would have to be cigarettes,"" he said, ""around 600 packs a week sold at my store.""

6. And the most shoplifted items are...odd. ""The two most shoplifted items is a tie between clothes and Tide Pods,"" the manager said. ""People were just slicing open the Tide Pod Pouches and dumping them into a bag. But I've seen a lot of stupid things get stolen like two packs [of] hot cocoa mix out of a box, a few trash bags out of a box, a few Ziploc bags out of a box that were only a dollar to begin with...tons more.""

7. Laundry products are considered the best deals, according to his customers. ""I get told laundry products. Beer is cheap too, same with phone chargers,"" he said when asked what the best dollar store deals are. ""We have iPhone 5 and 6 chargers for $15, while the stores down the street sell them for $30-40. Most of are our products are cheaper than other big box stores apparently (been told this by customers). Greeting cards are a deal. Most are 50¢-$1. If you go to a place like Hallmark they're about five bucks for the same ones.""

8. And other dollar stores aren't the main source of competition. ""Walmart markets are the competition and ever since four of them sprang up around my city, my district hasn't been breaking last year's sales,"" he explained.

19,Spray the top with vegetable oil and then cover it in plastic wrap. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a41502/this-is-how-you-can-stop-wasting-guacamole/,"I was 21 the first time I tried the glorious green dip that is guacamole. And it was only then that I realized I had not been living for those first 21 years of life. I was simply existing. There is no need to debate, discuss, or dispute whether or not guacamole is God's gift to us mere Earthlings.

Anyway, like all great things in the world, the sanctity of guacamole comes at a cost. The stuff lasts only about 2 minutes in the refrigerator until it turns into a mushy brown vat of slime.

But, there is a cure, and you probably already have everything you need to make it work. The next time you make guac, just spray the top with some vegetable oil, coconut oil, or olive oil spray, then cover it in plastic wrap. It should stay green for up to 24 hours, according to PureWow.

Naturally, we had to know how this works—especially before greasing up our guac. Turns out, the spray creates an oxygen barrier around the mashed avocado, which eliminates any oxidation from occurring (the process that makes it turn brown). You could try this trick on sliced avocados too—perfect if you're only using half for a stuffed avocado or avo toast and want to save the other half for later.

This hack's a game changer—though, if you eat the entire bowl of guac in one sitting, you really never have to worry about this problem.

It turns out that these structures aren't just offensive to the eyes.

Unsightly public architecture isn't always simply a product of bad taste — it can also serve as a means of social control and aims to repel local homeless populations, Atlas Obscura reported.

What makes architecture ""hostile""?

Known as hostile, defensive, or disciplinary architecture, these structures are strategically designed to deter homeless people and other groups perceived as undesirable from sleeping or loitering within eyesight of local residents.

""This style of architecture, which makes use of spikes, barricades, protrusions and checkpoints to prevent society’s unwanted from inhabiting public spaces, is not new,"" reporter Allegra Kirkland wrote on Alternet in 2015. ""But its forms are proliferating, and it can now be found in urban centers across the globe, from Tokyo to Copenhagen.""

This is what it looks like.

In 2014, a luxury apartment building in London installed “anti-homeless” spikes in a nearby alcove.

""People living in the flats, which sell for upwards of £800,000, said the metal studs were installed two weeks ago after a number of homeless people were seen sleeping there,"" the Telegraph reported in June 2014.

The spikes led to major backlash on social media, and they were ultimately removed.

Hostile architecture isn't always easy to spot.

Hostile architecture also pops up in more subtle forms — like public benches.

Often, defensive architecture is said to be installed for security purposes, but our definitions of safe and secure housing are colored by the stigma and criminalization of homelessness. ""This style of design cannot be untethered from broader anti-vagrancy efforts, particularly in the United States,"" Alternet reported.

""We see these measures all the time within our urban environments, whether in London or Tokyo, but we fail to process their true intent,"" writer Alex Andreou wrote on the Guardian. ""I hardly noticed them before I became homeless in 2009.""

""It was only then that I started scanning my surroundings with the distinct purpose of finding shelter and the city’s barbed cruelty became clear,"" he continued.

Andreou described what happened when he discovered an old wooden bench had been replaced with a more hostile design:

""An old, wooden bench, made concave and smooth by thousands of buttocks, underneath a sycamore with foliage so thick that only the most persistent rain could penetrate it. Sheltered and warm, perched as it was against a wall behind which a generator of some sort radiated heat, this was prime property. Then, one morning, it was gone. In its place stood a convex metal perch, with three solid armrests. I felt such loss that day.""

Not all hostile architecture is ugly, either. It can even come in the form of a pretty plant, placed somewhere homeless people might otherwise sleep or rest.

""Hostile design comes in even more innocuous, and sometimes even lovely forms,"" Atlas Obscura pointed out. ""Take the humble potted plant. What could be hostile about a leafy ficus in a pretty pot? Nothing—until you consider where it's placed.""

Hostile architecture attempts to conceal poverty and homelessness, which are already criminalized in many U.S. cities.

There are already many laws that criminalize homelessness in the U.S., as Alternet activism editor Alyssa Figueroa pointed out in a February 2015 piece. These laws restrict homeless individuals from activities like resting, begging, sharing food, and urinating in public.

""Hostile architecture facilitates the work of law enforcement by making it physically impossible for the homeless to inhabit public spaces,"" Kirkland observed on Alternet. ""Neither approach actually addresses the root causes of homelessness, but instead shoves it out of sight.""

The possibility of spazzing out after reading this is very likely, but it’s super important so here goes: There’s a really scary reason you should avoid charging your phone in public. Not only can your charging habits kill your phone battery, but they also place you at risk of becoming the next victim of hacking, specifically if you connect your phone to a compromised charging port exposes your personal info to hackers, Cosmo reports.

According to CNN, this particular form of technological thievery is referred to as “juice jacking,” and basically works the same way as when you use a USB cord to download images from your phone to your computer. Unfortunately, there’s no way to tell if a public port has been hacked, so the best way to avoid exposing all of your pertinent info (including emails, text messages and contacts) is to stop charging your phones in public.

Or you could completely snap and destroy your cell phone because, srsly, how frustrating is this?!

So making sure your phone is fully charged before you leave the house is a huge hassle, and honestly feels like an impossible feat, but since there are selfies and Snapchats to be shared, going the extra step to protect yourself is totally worth it.

31,They *might* increase their membership costs $5-$10. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/life/a41225/costco-membership-price-hike/,"Buying in bulk can reap all kinds of rewards, like not having to buy paper towels for two months, or saving big on that 48-ounce box of crackers for your wine and cheese night. But if you're a member of Costco, you might have to prepare to shell out extra cash for those benefits.

The megastore is apparently planning to charge more for its memberships. Analysts at UBS bank expect the hike to be as much as 10 percent. That means the basic Gold Star Membership annual fee would jump up $5, from $55 a year to $60, and the Executive Membership would increase from $110 to $120.

Costco hasn't officially confirmed that this is happening, but the company's chief financial officer Richard Galanti said during a conference call last month that the time is probably right for a price increase, Consmerist reports. This could be in part to help the chain expand, as it has 30 new stores slated to open this year, about half of which will be the U.S.

If you are thinking about dropping your membership now, remember that you can still (sort of) shop there without one.

32,"It's made of silicone, so it doesn't absorb (or waste) as much product as a regular makeup sponge. It's also easier to clean. #stopclickbait",http://www.thisisinsider.com/what-is-the-silisponge-beauty-blender-2016-12,"The INSIDER Summary:

• There's a new silicone makeup sponge.

• It's called the Silisponge.

• People are excited about it because it's easy to clean and doesn't require as much product.

• It's currently sold out.



Every week when I'm cleaning my makeup sponge, I look down and think there has to be an easier way to do this.

Well, now there is.

Molly Cosmetics has recreated the classic beauty sponge in a big way. They made it out of silicone. Stay with me here, because it's actually pretty awesome. The best part is that you won't break the bank trying it out. The Silisponge is super affordable, but only if you can get your hands on one.

Makeup sponges are nothing new — until now, that is. In case you haven't seen the latest beauty innovation, let me break it down for you. According to the company's Instagram, the Silisponge works the same way that your typical makeup sponge would. It applies foundation, blush or bronzer to the skin. The only difference is that it saves you a whole lot of product while it does it. Because it's silicone, no makeup soaks into the sponge. It's also a heck of a lot easier to clean.

And as if all of that wasn't already enough. The Silisponge is also super affordable as well. As of now, the sixth restock has already sold out, but the products are selling $9.90 for one or $14.90 for two. That's pretty darn affordable, if you ask me. It comes as no surprise that the products are constantly selling out at this price.

Not to mention you'll be able to use these forever. Since it's so easy to clean and you don't have to worry about makeup being trapped inside, odds are you'll only have to buy one your entire beauty career. On top of saving money on foundation, this product seems to be an all-around money-saver.

The only problem with the beauty tool is trying to get your hands on one. It's currently sold out of their sixth restock, which is pretty darn amazing, if you ask me. Molly Cosmetics shows no sign of slowing down on production though, so odds are there will be plenty more restocks to come.

I don't know about you, but I'm dying to try this out! If you want to be one of the first ones to snag the seventh restock, you can sign up for emails on the company's site. That's probably your best bet to getting this wonder product!",2017-01-20 10:19:50

But regardless of what you put in it, we bet you aren't using that space for its intended purpose: a warming drawer.

Yep, that's right. It sounds crazy that appliance manufacturers expect us to let such a large potential storage space sit empty, but on some oven models, it's designed to be a spot to keep your food warm.

If you're skeptical, just dig up your oven's owner's manual. You may find a description like this: ""The warming drawer is designed to keep hot foods at serving temperature. Always start with hot food. Cold or room-temperature foods cannot be heated, warmed, or cooked in the warming drawer.""

This news may or may not come as a surprise to you, but if you think you'd miss the extra storage space, we have a solution. Continue storing your extra pots and pans in the drawer—and then just empty it to keep dinner warm when your guests are running late. Win-win!

Alton Brown best described eggnog when he remarked that it is almost identical to ice cream. It is technically just a stirred custard made of milk and egg, after all.

No one really knows why eggnog has become the iconic holiday drink. Most believe we have 18th century American colonials to thank ― the most famous supporter being George Washington, whose recipe for a very boozy homemade nog is still used today. The origins of nog are murky, though culinary historians can agree that it is related to posset, an early British medieval drink made of warm milk and ale.

One thing we do know that you have to drink some over the holidays. Adventurous folks might make a batch from scratch ― we applaud you ― but most eggnog imbibers will just pick up a carton at the grocery store. There are more than enough options out there, which made us realize: we have no idea who makes the best eggnog.

We quickly remedied that with a taste test. Eight discerning eggnog lovers tasted blindly tasted 10 different nogs in a quest to find the best store-bought brand. We tried classic versions, one fancy local version ― as a control ― and all kinds of milk alternative nogs. The most-loved eggnog, the winner of the taste test, came as a shock to us all.

Below are the results. Each nog was rated on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest score. (As always with HuffPost taste tests, we were in no way sponsored by any of the brands below.)",2017-01-08 11:21:01

By Jeff Forte

Change always happens one thing at a time.

Even when I knew this was true, it was still hard for me to do because it seemed like so much was wrong with my marriage that none of the common marriage advice could fix it.

I was walking on eggshells around my wife, trying to avoid another disagreement. They were happening far too often. It seemed like we couldn’t see eye to eye on anything, and both of us were getting more stressed out day by day.

I knew I wanted to live happily ever after, I just didn’t know how to make it happen.

I also knew for sure that our marriage wasn’t going to survive much more of this. It seemed like there were so many aspects of our marriage that needed to be fixed, and I didn’t know where to start.

Advertisement

Then a thought occurred to me ... I could at least do one thing.

But which one thing? Where would I start?

When I thought about everything that was wrong in my marriage I realized that none of it was going to change unless my wife and I could talk to each other without arguing.

How was that going to happen?

Advertisement

I realized that the only way we would even want to talk with one another would be if we felt closer to each other.

So I decided that what I needed to do was to work on improving the feelings of closeness between us.

That was it!

All I did every day was to work on bringing us closer together. I focused on affection, connection, and feelings of togetherness.

You could do that too. It worked wonders for me.

That’s the one thing, and the only thing, that gave all of our other issues a chance to be resolved. By putting everything else that wasn’t working in our relationship on hold, we both had a chance to breathe.

When I put everything outside of feeling connected to each other on hold, it took the pressure off of us. And the stress went away.

If I hadn’t done that, and instead had continued to try to address all of our problems at once, we might have divorced.

I know personally that love isn’t always easy.

It can be hard when you are feeling bitter or resentful. It can be difficult when you feel unloved by your partner. It can even be painful if your feelings of affection get rejected.

Advertisement

But you could also do one thing.

You could focus on the feelings of togetherness, creating a better connection, and demonstrating affection for each other. You could do any of those things.

People also need to know how to resolve their conflicts and improve intimacy and communication. We are either growing in love with our partner — or losing love. We are either feeling more deeply connected or less. And those are all things you can do something about.

Will you?

Everyone needs to know how to bring love back into their lives. If you are interested in getting Jeff's thoughts on how to repair your marriage, reach out to him here.

Nicole, 32, doesn’t have one-night stands. She has half-night stands. After sex, she heads back home and wakes up in her own bed.

Her hookup buddy doesn’t mind, because he, too, prefers half-night stands.

“We enjoy our time together but when it’s over, it’s over,” Nicole, who works as a writer and project manager in Dallas, Texas, told The Huffington Post. “We both have demanding careers and insanely early mornings. Starting the day in my own bed ― where I can race to my computer at 6 a.m., if necessary ― is just easier for everyone involved.”

Half-night stands are becoming more and more common. They’re essentially an abbreviated version of the one-night stand ― instead of staying the night, one person makes their exit after sex.

“If you don’t want anything more than sex, what’s the point of staying overnight with a stranger?” Bay Area sex therapist Celeste Hirschman told HuffPost. “It’s just easier to go home so you can sleep in your own comfortable bed, wake up, and start your day fresh.”

According to Tammy Nelson, a psychologist and author of The New Monogamy, the half-night stand trend suggests women are simply asserting more sexual agency.

Advertisement

“Women call the shots now,” she told HuffPost. “They choose to go to bed with a man or choose to leave after the sex and go home to their own place. And if they choose to stay, they make that choice. It really is a new time of sexual freedom for women.”

“We live in a ‘swipe’ culture where it's easy to hook up quick and move onto the next encounter.""” - Max DuBowy, a millennial in Portland, Oregon

Of course, no-strings-attached sex is nothing new. But this is no-strings attached sex without the awkward morning after. And naturally, it’s not only women who are hooking up and forgoing small talk the next morning.

Max DuBowy, a 26-year-old gay writer and life coach in Portland, Oregon, leaves early, too, by and large without regrets.

“I think there are two reasons millennials like myself are choosing to cut and run after hooking up,” DuBowy explained to HuffPost. “First, we live in a ‘swipe’ culture where it’s easy to hook up quick and move onto the next encounter. Sex is sort of like ice cream, in that it comes in all kinds of flavors; Some evenings vanilla ice cream tastes good, but other nights, you’re really craving rocky road.”

Advertisement

Plus, DuBowy also believes millennials are smart enough to compartmentalize sex and love.

“Sex is simply an activity. Love is intimate and deeper,” he said. “It’s easier to move on after getting it on since love usually isn’t part of the experience until you’re in a committed relationship.”

But half-night stands are often to the detriment of meaningful human connection.

“When I only wanted to get my jollies off, I felt satisfied and content after a half-night stand,” DuBowy said. “But if I wanted to use sex to get my mind off feeling lonely, I felt lonelier after the hookup.”

“Be sure to tell the person you’re going home with that you can’t spend the night before you actually get to their home.”” - Seth Meyers, a psychologist in Los Angeles

And of course, sometimes there are weird, conflicted feelings after a half-night stand. To text or not to text the next day? Was this one night of passion and nothing more?

As 27-year-old writer Brenda Mejia has discovered firsthand, half-night stands become a lot more complicated when feelings are involved.

“It’s definitely something that can cut both ways,” said Mejia, who blogs about travel and sports at Traveleira.com. “People want their own privacy but you’re still intimating passion and still feel a sense of attachment during that time.”

That’s why people who prefer half-night stands should be transparent with their sexual partners, said Seth Meyers, a psychologist and author of Dr. Seth’s Love Prescription: Overcome Relationship Repetition Syndrome and Find the Love You Deserve.

“Be sure to tell the person you’re going home with that you can’t spend the night before you actually get to their home,” he said. “Or that you have an early morning so you’d prefer they not stay over.”

If they have a heads up “and it feels like the two of you made the decision together, there shouldn’t be awkwardness when it comes time to leave,” Meyers said.",2017-01-04 08:13:00

",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-the-blood-in-steak_us_57fc0219e4b0e655eab6eb36,"While many people love a good rare steak, others (ahem, Donald Trump) have a fear ― or at least concerns ― about eating meat that looks “bloody.” But before you turn down that juicy rare steak, it’s worth taking a moment to learn about why it isn’t going to hurt you.

As it turns out, that “blood” in your steak isn’t blood at all.

Advertisement

It’s myoglobin, the protein that delivers oxygen to an animal’s muscles. This protein turns red when meat is cut, or exposed to air. Heating the protein turns it a darker color. Rare meat isn’t “bloody,” it is just cooked to a lower temperature.

There’s a reason some meats are darker than others.

Myoglobin delivers oxygen to muscle tissues. Animals with more active muscle tissues, as well as older animals, both have meat with more myoglobin, Jeffrey Savell, a distinguished professor of Meat Science at Texas A&M University, told HuffPost.

That’s why veal, which is the meat from a baby calf, is much lighter in color than steak from a full-grown cow ― its muscles haven’t been activated as much as the older cows. It’s also why darker meat is found on turkey legs (where there’s more active muscle tissue) and lighter meat is found in the breasts.

The freshest meat is actually purple.

A fresh-cut slab of cow’s meat is actually purplish in color, Savell says. Exposure to oxygen during the packing process turns it the cherry-red tone we’ve come to associate with freshness.

“This pigment is of major importance, since it represents the bright red color desired by purchasers,” reads “Lawrie’s Meat Science,” one of the tentpole books for students and professionals in the meat industry. Some producers have even gone so far as to treat their meat with carbon dioxide gas in order to lock in this red color far past its normal lifespan.

But brown does NOT mean it’s bad.

Advertisement

After a few days in a grocery store display case, myoglobin molecules naturally oxidize and the meat eventually turns brown, Savell says. It may look less appealing, but it isn’t any less safe to eat.

“Brown meat doesn’t mean it’s bad,” Savell said. “But [grocery stores] will discount it, mark it down. If you buy brown meat, just be sure to cook it right away, because it’s likely already been out there for three or four days.”

Bloomberg via Getty Images

A meat’s color can tell you how it was cooked.

Meat changes color depending on its internal temperature at the time of cooking. According to “Lawrie’s Meat Science,” red meat that reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit during cooking will have a bright red interior, while red meat cooked to 140 to 158 degrees will be pink. Anything hotter than that should turn the meat grayish-brown.

Keep in mind, however, that the U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture recommends cooking steak to an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit and letting it rest for three minutes to kill nasty bacteria that could make you sick.

Pavlo_K via Getty Images

So if it’s not blood, what’s all that juice?

If you’re cooking fresh meat to rare, then you can expect a lot of red myoglobin to be present. Account for the water that naturally occurs in muscle tissues, and you’ve got a bright-red juice that may look similar to blood, but isn’t at all.

“Meat is about 70 percent water,” Sevell says. “So you have water, and myoglobin, and other pigments that leak out. That’s where this juice comes from. I can assure you it’s not blood.”",2017-01-03 07:12:00

",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/infidelity-sign_us_57c075e1e4b04193420ef97d,"It may seem like there are a hundred complicated reasons why infidelity becomes an issue in so many marriages, but according to preacher and author DeVon Franklin, one big reason is actually quite simple. And it begins, he says, before a wedding even takes place.

As DeVon explains during a conversation with Oprah about relationships, sex and celibacy on “SuperSoul Sunday,” men, in particular, have been conditioned to give in to their sex drive. The result, DeVon says in the interview and in his book, “The Wait,” is typically recklessness and chaos.

“As men, we’re raised in a culture where that type of behavior is almost encouraged and rewarded,” he says. “Sometimes, we find validation as men in that type of behavior, but it’s the same behavior that suffocates and kills us.”

DeVon ― who together with his wife, Meagan Good, chose to remain celibate until their 2012 marriage ― also says that one’s sexual behaviors before marriage are the same behaviors that will exist within the marriage as well.

“If I had no discipline in sex before marriage, I will have no discipline in sex after marriage,” DeVon states simply. “And we wonder why most marriages end and why infidelity is so high.”

Too often, he adds, people assume (or hope) that the words “I do” are some sort of magic spell.

“It’s not like [when] you get married and you say, ‘I do,’ everything I practiced is out the window,” DeVon points out. “No. What you have practiced, what habits you have, they’re still there.”

A pilot has revealed why they dim the cabin lights when taking off and landing – and it’s got nothing to do with making it more dramatic for the passengers.

Yes, it turns out there’s actually a very good reason you can’t read your book during landing and it’s all to do with safety according to one pilot, The Daily Mail reports.

Advert 10

According to Chris Cooke, who flies with a major domestic airline, the procedure is a precautionary measure designed to allow passengers’ eyes to adjust to darkness quickly.

Adrian Pingstone

The human eye takes about ten minutes to adjust to darkness so by dimming the lights valuable time is saved in an emergency.

The idea being that if something goes wrong during the plane’s descent and an emergency evacuation is suddenly necessary it’s vital that people actually be able to see.

Advert 10

He explains:

Imagine being in an unfamiliar bright room filled with obstacles when someone turns off the lights and asks you to exit quickly. Pixabay

Dimming the lights also makes the emergency path-lighting and signs easier to see and helps passengers maintain ‘a basic sense of orientation’.

Chris also went on to add this is the same reason why passengers are asked to leave blinds up during landing as unobstructed windows can bring in natural light if during an emergency the lights suddenly cut out.

This new study finds that 1 year after starting (and sticking to!) an aerobic exercise regimen, postmenopausal women who worked out twice as much—300 minutes a week—lost more weight and twice as much body fat, plus they dropped more inches from their waists.

The study, published in JAMA Oncology, followed 384 women between the ages of 50 and 74, who at the start of the study were mostly inactive. Their BMIs ranged between 22 and 40. The women were assigned to two groups: One group followed official guidelines by working out 5 days a week, 30 minutes per session, for a total of 150 minutes; the other group exercised 5 days for 60 minutes at a time to reach 300 minutes a week. Any aerobic activity was allowed, as long as it was vigorous—enough for the women to break a sweat, but still be able to carry on a conversation.

[block:bean=sub-offer-betterbody-block]

After 1 year, the women who exercised longer lost nearly twice as much total body fat and more total body weight (3.3% lost versus 2.5%), compared with the women who followed the 150-minute program. Exercising longer also led to lower BMI, less abdominal fat, and slimmer waists—nearly 2.5 inches lost versus less than 2 inches—and all of this was accomplished while the women continued to follow their normal diets. (Got 10 minutes? Then you've got time to lose the weight for good with Prevention's new 10-minute workouts and 10-minute meals. Get Fit in 10: Slim and Strong for Life now! )

Doubling the loss in body fat is especially exciting, says study author Christine Friedenreich, PhD, scientific leader of cancer epidemiology and prevention research at Alberta Health Services in Canada. Body fat is a known risk factor for breast cancer and other chronic diseases for this group of women; previous studies have shown that lowering body fat also helps prevent endometrial and colon cancers, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.

""This study provides definitive data on exercising longer to decrease fat levels,"" Friedenreich says. ""Yes, 150 minutes of exercise per week is beneficial, but 300 minutes is better.""

Phew—ready for the challenge? You can do 60 minutes 5 days a week like the women in the study, or you could aim for 40 minutes of vigorous activity every day. For extra motivation, try working out with a friend, adding these songs to your playlist , or switching up your routine with a variety of gym classes, like yoga, spin, dance, or Zumba.

45,Mayonnaise. It adds a creamy flavour and helps prevent the bread from burning. ,http://www.simplemost.com/use-instead-butter-make-grilled-cheese-absolutely-heavenly-2016-2/,"No matter how old you get, you’ll never outgrow your love of a grilled cheese sandwich. Because really, there’s nothing better than when bread toasted to perfection and combines with melted cheese, is there? I didn’t think so.

If you thought you couldn’t love grilled cheese more than you already do, get ready to be amazed. This trick for making the perfect grilled cheese sandwich will bring you an entirely newfound appreciation for the food.

So, here’s the thing: Instead of spreading butter on the bread right before dropping it into the skillet, you’re going to spread a layer of mayonnaise.

Not only will this add a little creamy flavor, it will also help your bread toast just the way you like it, without burning. Because we’ve all burned a grilled cheese or two in our day, right? Well, not anymore.

According to PureWow, using mayonnaise will ensure your bread is golden brown because mayonnaise won’t burn as easily as butter. It’s the oil and egg in the condiment that allows for the brown coloring and all of that added flavor.

And Hellman’s must agree. They released a commercial to promote using their mayo to craft the perfect grilled cheese.

Just pull out the mayonnaise and heat up the skillet, the most delicious sandwich of your life is coming right up!

Or, you could skip pulling out the skillet and try something new. Have you heard about people making grilled cheese in their air fryer? It can be done, and some people swear by it.

One of our writers tried several different methods for making grilled cheese with her air fryer — but the traditional way, with butter rather than mayo on the outside of the bread. She came away from the experience with a clear winner: the method that involved using the air fryer’s crisping basket.

46,The boy stood up to sing along to Hakuna Matata. No one said anything to him. ,https://themighty.com/2016/10/going-to-an-autism-friendly-performance-of-the-lion-king-on-broadway/,"Growing up, I was a huge fan of “The Lion King.” Now as an adult, I still love watching the film with my younger cousins and mentees. Then recently, I heard that an autism-friendly performance of “The Lion King” was happening on Broadway! I bought tickets right away and was ready for the nostalgia to begin.

Thanks to the Theatre Development Fund and the Autism Theatre Initiative, every season they have several of these autism-friendly performances for our families to enjoy.

The day of the performance came and I was ecstatic. As the performance began, all the families seemed to be thoroughly enjoying themselves. Right before the end of the first act, the actors were performing the classic song “Hakuna Matata” when I noticed a young boy stand up out of his chair and began to sing along.

There this boy was, flapping his arms and singing, and I was thinking the worst was about to happen. I instantly became concerned for the boy. That any minute, there would be a stranger making a comment in his direction.

But what happened next left me speechless…

Absolutely nothing.

No judgment. No criticism. Just a boy singing “Hakuna Matata” with a big smile on his face.

As the song concluded after the first act ended, and the lights came back on, I noticed a woman next to the boy with tears still running down her eyes. A smile just as big as the boy’s was on her face.

The audience understood that the boy was having an amazing time at the theater.

These are the types of moments that take my breath away.

This was a moment where there was no judgment from anyone around them, just people enjoying something together as a family.

When I was growing up on the autism spectrum, I often struggled with challenges in the theater due to my sensory issues. But even though the loud noises tended to bother me at times, one of my key interests was in theater. I was able to enjoy countless moments of pure joy with my family, and so was this mom with her son.

I cannot thank the Theatre Development Fund and the Autism Theatre Initiative for continuing to make these moments possible for our community. We need more people to lead by their example in their local communities to make all forms of entertainment possible for our loved ones in an autism-friendly setting.

The performance that day was incredible, but for me it was the audience that stole the show. Thank you to our community for making that moment possible.

50,"This article alleges that the cure is to create a paste out of honey, coconut oil, and flour and strap it down to your chest. ",http://shareably.net/honey-wrap-cough-remedy/,"Teen went from being completely healthy to being told she was going to die within two weeks

No one likes the taste of cough syrup in their mouth and having a nasty cough that won’t go away has to be one of the most uncomfortable states of being possible. Coughing, of course, is due not only to irritation in your throat due to allergens, but it is also due to a buildup of mucous in your bronchial tubes which can further lead to bronchitis, chronic cough, and dry heaving in the lungs.

What if I told you that there was a natural alternative to calming these symptoms and that it would cost absolutely nothing to your health to give it a go?! The idea is to create a paste out of honey, coconut oil, and flour. After that, simply strap it to your chest overnight (if you’re an adult) to begin all it to aid in soothing your symptoms!

It is called a “Honey Wrap.”

What exactly is wrong with cough syrup and pharmaceutical options? Codeine and dextromethorphan

Codeine sulfate is what is called an opioid analgesic (a pain reliever) that has a whole slew of common side effects such as: drowsiness, light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, and the list goes on. Of course these can be amplified when taken with other medications which also induce sleep as is common when trying to tackle multiple symptoms such as mucus in the lungs, sinus pressure, and allergy symptoms such as stuffy, runny nose etc.

Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant that is commonly used in over-the counter drugs. This particular drug is used to suppress the signals to your brain that would tell it to spasm your lungs in attempt to purge it from irritants as well as the signals that would come from your throat that would tell your brain to make a powerful cough from your lungs to push the mucus caught in your throat out.

So what can a Honey Wrap do for you? The specifics

The first ingredient of interest in my opinion wouldn’t be honey, but the coconut oil! Coconut oil is high in lauric acid, therefore it is thought to dissolve the lipid coating (lipid means the “fatty” layer which the virus used as protection) around some viruses and thus makes them more susceptible to attack by the immune system!

The partner in crime, honey, has often been used orally to temporarily relieve common cold symptoms such as sore, itchy throat and coughing fits. In this case we are attempting to go straight to the source of the issue, the mucus in your lungs, by applying the mixture topically and allowing it to be absorbed into your system.

Recipe: Honey Wrap (adapted from a recipe by besthealthyguide)

Supplies/Ingredients

Raw organic honey

Coconut oil

Flour

Napkin

Adhesive medical tape

Directions:

Mix a teaspoon of flour with some honey, and then add some warmed coconut oil. Apply to a napkin, and place in the center of your chest with some adhesive medical tape. This all-natural compress can be applied to an adult overnight, or to a child for only 2-3 hours. You should notice some results after the first treatment, but as with all natural treatments time is your friend, and it’s perfectly safe to do multiple treatments over a week.

Give this method a try! Being an all-natural treatment that uses relatively little of the products in question you can be assured of safety and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, if it isn’t for you, you are now aware of some safety information in regards to common cough-related pharmaceuticals!

",https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/this-is-the-worst-lunch-to-eat-in-the-office-according-to-a-new-survey,"Finding an appropriate office lunch is a minefield. The kind of minefield that risks a mortifying, all-office ""Reminder NOT to heat curry in the microwave"" email if executed incorrectly. Obvious no-nos are egg mayonnaise, sloppy burritos, and anything involving fish, but then what about a harmless tuna salad? And if you sit opposite the office veggie, are BLT sandwiches allowed?

A new study conducted by interior landscaping firm Ambius (because, erm, nothing enhances an interior space like anxiously munching coworkers) delves deeper into the precarious world of eating al desko. Surveying 1,000 UK office workers, the firm found that two thirds eat lunch at their desks most days of the week.

And what are these one-handed typers stuffing in their mouths and trying not to spill over their keyboards? Hopefully nothing with too pungent an aroma: Ambius also found that over half of those surveyed branded colleagues who eat smelly food in the office as ""anti-social.""

The most anti-social of these foods were mackerel, sardines, cheese, and eggs. There goes tomorrow's niçoise salad, then.

The survey found that the least offensive lunches were those of tempting buttered toast, pastries, and bacon sandwiches. Commenting on the findings, Gareth Cowmeadow of Ambius said: ""Some people may not realize how much of an effect their lunch choices could have on coworkers who sit near them.""

But what might be even worse than oblivious, pickled onion-chomping coworkers, however, is that Ambius also found that two out of five of office workers simply do not have enough time to take a proper lunch break.",2016-12-16 07:53:33
52,She would have married her husband regardless of the quality of the ring - she loves him and not the material possessions. ,http://www.countryliving.com/life/a40787/viral-facebook-post-wedding-bands/,"Last month, Ariel Desiree McRae and Quinn McRae decided they couldn't wait any longer to get married. After two years of dating, they decided to head to the court house and skip the big wedding. But the one tradition Quinn didn't want to miss? Buying his fiancée engagement and wedding rings.

Even though Ariel says they scrape and scrape just to pay the bills and put food in their bellies, Quinn saved up just enough money to buy two matching rings for $130. Since they made Ariel happy, you'd think that would be all that matters. But in a Facebook post that has since gone viral, Ariel shares how outside influences almost ruined their special moment.

""While we were purchasing my rings however, another lady that was working there came over to help the lady selling them to us,"" Ariel says. ""She said, 'Y'all can you believe that some men get these as engagement rings? How pathetic.'"" Ariel says she saw her now-husband's face fall and responded with the classiest response ever: ""It isn't the ring that matters, it is the love that goes into buying one that is.""

In fact, Ariel says she would have married him even if he gave her a 25 cent ring from a gum ball machine. To her, it wasn't about the rings she wore on her finger, but the love and happiness he brought to her life. Clearly, this story has struck a cord with people during the expensive holiday season, as her post has been shared more than 45,000 times.

""He was afraid that the love I have for him would pale, because he couldn't afford the wedding set I wanted,"" Ariel says. ""But here I am though, court house-married, $130 ring set, the love of my life by my side, and happier than I could ever imagine.""

After nine months of exhaustive research in the realms of art, fashion, architecture, travel and more, color experts have determined that the color we’ll see everywhere next year is ... green.

Or Greenery, to be more specific. Say hello to what experts call the “zesty yellow-green” tone of 2017:

Pantone

After what many would call one of the most disastrous years in modern history, this “reassuring” color will “provide us with the hope we collectively yearn for,” according to a Pantone press release.

And no, the color was not chosen in response to the election results. The New York Times reports that Pantone experts noticed a proliferation of green before the election ended, originally pegging it as a symbol of new beginnings under our presumed first female president.

Politics aside, Pantone recommends working Greenery into your home, whether it’s with a Greenery-colored couch:

There’s only one way to know if your partner is cheating: Nope, it’s not by thumbing through their text messages and emails. To really get down to the truth, you have to ask your spouse directly.

“Instead of becoming a detective and snooping through their phone, consider talking about it,” Elisa Dombrowski, a marriage and family therapist in Orange County, California, told The Huffington Post. “Let them know you can handle the truth and that you believe you can work through anything, as long as there’s honesty.”

Below, Dombrowski and other marriage therapists offer more advice for broaching the delicate subject.

You deserve to know if your partner is faithful. If you have a suspicion that something is amiss in your relationship, don’t ignore the warning signs, Dombrowski said.

“Some people worry that confronting their partner will force the break up of their relationship,” she said. “They hope it will go away on its own but it’s often this lack of communication that creates distance in the relationship from the beginning, making it easier for an affair to take place.”

Ultimately, you should trust your intuition and broach the subject delicately, she said.

Advertisement

“Too often, we condition ourselves to ignore that tiny voice inside that says something doesn’t feel quite right,” Dombrowski added.

Don’t lower yourself to snooping through email or text messages, especially if you’re hopeful your relationship can withstand any possible betrayal, said Stephanie Mintz, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles, California.

“Resist the temptation to snoop,” she told HuffPost. “This would be a total breach of trust and privacy on your part and would make rebuilding that trust much more difficult. Although you may suspect your partner or spouse has already broken the trust, you don’t want to add fuel to the fire.”

Timing is critical when discussing a subject this sensitive, Mintz said. You’ll both need to be in the right frame of mind, so to that end, don’t bring it up at 12 a.m. on a Monday, when you’re both exhausted. (Indeed, studies have shown that the brain’s emotional centers are more reactive when we’re sleep deprived.)

Advertisement

“You don’t want this to be rushed and you don’t want to do it before work, when children are around or with an activity to go to shortly after,” Mintz said. “Wait for an evening after each of you has had some time to unwind from work or a weekend where you don’t have plans for later on in the day.”

This is bound to be an uncomfortable conversation. You may want to begin the talk by acknowledging how uneasy it makes you, said Todd Creager, a marriage therapist in Orange County, California and the author of The Little Black Book On Infidelity.

“Let your partner know that you have some uneasy feelings and need him or her to help you sort through them,” he said. “Then go ahead and let your partner know what you are suspicious of or what caused your uneasiness.”

Your spouse still may get angry and defensive ― especially if your suspicions are true ― “but you’re cutting down the chances of defensiveness by focusing on yourself and not your partner,” Creager said.

Let your partner know that when you feel uneasy or have an intuition, you owe it to yourself to check it out, Creager said.

“By bringing it up, you are educating your partner that you have integrity,” he said. “Let him or her know that you are owed the truth if nothing else. You deserve to know what is truly going on so that you can make a good decision for yourself.”

It can be isolating and painful to deal with infidelity. Depending on the answer you receive from your partner, you might consider seeking individual or couples therapy afterward, Dombrowski said.",2016-12-09 08:52:02

United will become the first big U.S. airline to limit low-fare customers to one carry-on bag that fits under a seat.

The announcement on Tuesday could frustrate flyers who already feel burdened with airline travel restrictions and fees.

Advertisement

United, the No. 3 U.S. airline by passengers carried, said customers who bought its cheapest fares would not be assigned seats until the day of departure, meaning people on the same ticket may be split apart.

United will also prohibit these travelers from carrying on bags that can only fit in overhead bins, and they will not accrue miles toward elite status.

The company expects the moves to add $4.8 billion to its annual operating income by 2020, although the figure does not include rising wages.

Fare initiatives such as “basic economy” will account for $1 billion of this, as more customers pay to check bags or select higher fares that give them two “free” carry-ons.

United’s announcement follows Delta Air Lines’ decision to sell cheap tickets that prohibit itinerary changes and seat selection.

“This action clearly shows how airline consolidation is eliminating choice,” Charlie Leocha, chairman of consumer advocacy group Travelers United, said in an email. “Simply stated, this is an example of airline consolidation gone too far, with choice and transparency being wrung out of the system.”

Klaus Lahnstein via Getty Images

Delta and United hope to lure customers with cheap fares and upsell them once they reveal the conditions of the ticket. It’s a practice they are using to compete with low-cost carriers Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines, which charge for add-ons including carry-on bags.

“Customers have told us that they want more choice and Basic Economy delivers just that,” Julia Haywood, United’s chief commercial officer, said in a news release.

The boarding process will also be faster because fewer customers will be searching for overhead bin space, United said.

Chicago-based United said it would begin selling the no-frills fares in the first quarter of 2017 for travel starting in the second quarter. Prices will be comparable to low fares it now charges for the economy cabin, but with more restrictions.

The initiative is part of United’s long-promised plan to rival Delta, which is more profitable and cancels fewer flights.",2016-12-08 08:50:34

Post-It Notes have been making life better for decades now, but we've always kind of despised how they become curly after we peel and stick them onto our desks.

Apparently, this is our own egregious error: Post-Its are indeed designed to lay flat, even after you peel and stick them. We've simply been doing it wrong.

Blogger Martin Schapendonk brought this to light a few years ago, and Elite Daily relayed it to the masses earlier this month. We were so taken with the breakthrough, we simply had to try it ourselves.

But who, exactly, can you ask about that kind of thing?

That's where Anna Rothschild of PBS' digital series, Gross Science comes in. As Rothschild explains, chemicals that help the uterus contract and shed its lining each month also sometimes travel over to the bowels, forcing them to do the same. Hence, poop.

In addition, levels of a hormone called progesterone, which tends to be constipating, drop when the body is menstruating. As a result, poops tend to flow more freely.

63,Only if it hurts. #stopclickbait,http://www.prevention.com/fitness/should-you-worry-if-your-knees-crack,"In most cases, if your knees crack but don't hurt, then the noise is just crepitus—gas bubbles bursting, says Tony Gentilcore, CSCS, cofounder of Cressey Sports Performance in Massachusetts. Sure, crepitus sounds scary, but those gases—oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide—are just part of synovial fluid, a natural joint lubricant. So relax, you're fine.

Another harmless knee noisemaker: Your tendons may be clicking back into place after shifting slightly out of their original position.

What isn't normal is popping accompanied by pain.

""Some people push their knees too far forward while squatting, and that puts a lot of undue stress on their joints,"" Gentilcore says. Over time, this causes cartilage to wear down and lose its smoothness, resulting in an audible noise when your bones grind against each other as you bend.

Worst case? You'll tear your meniscus.

(For even more ways to improve your squat, check out The Secrets to the Perfect Squat.)

If your knees hurt, it's probably best to have them checked out by a doctor. You may be told to take a few weeks off from working out to let any swelling die down.

When you return to lifting, check your form with the wall squat test: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and toes touching a wall. Then squat. If your knees hit the wall, try again, this time keeping your hips back and shins vertical. Do it right and you'll be rewarded with silence.

(Cochineal insects, to be exact) #stopclickbait",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/red-food-dye-cochineal-bugs_us_56fafd25e4b083f5c605f3dd,"Red food dye has always given our beloved red velvet cupcakes their rich, festive color. But that aesthetic pleasure comes with a pretty nasty secret.

Much of the red coloring we use in food is actually made of crushed bugs. Yep, creepy, crawly bugs.

Cochineal insects, as they're known, are scale insects that, in their pre-crushed state, look like this:

Lal via Getty Images Bugs today, red velvet cupcakes tomorrow.

Cochineal insects can be found on prickly pear cacti in the North American deserts, where they spends most of their lives sucking away on the plants’ sap. They produce a bitter, crimson-colored pigment called carminic acid, which they store in their guts and use to ward off predators.

To make red dye, manufacturers dry the cochineals and grind them into a powder. The powder turns a bright red when mixed with water.

It may sound gross, but humans have been brightening up life with the crushed guts of cochineals for centuries.

Advertisement

The Mixtec Indians of pre-Hispanic Mexico even farmed and domesticated the bugs, using the dye to color their clothing and show off their social status. By the 1900s, Americans began using cochineal dye to color a variety of foods, including sausages, pies, dried shrimp, candy and jams.

But when word got out that the crushed-bug dye was in Starbucks' beloved Strawberries and Creme Frappuccinos in 2012, people started to freak.

Starbucks ditched the dye completely, but cochineal dye is still widely used in the food industry -- just check the labels on colored Jell-O packages, candies and yogurts for the words carmine, carminic acid or cochineal extract.

And while cochineal dye definitely has an ick-factor, the alternatives are synthetic, including one dye that is made from coal tar sludge, according to Bob Alderink of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.

""Cochineal dye has been around for centuries. It is a natural, renewable resource,"" Alderink explains in a video. ""And in my opinion, it's just plain cool.""

65,A blender. ,http://www.countryliving.com/home-design/a40286/the-only-kitchen-appliance-you-really-need/,"In any kitchen—whether apartment-size tiny or suburban-level enormous—there are bound to be some superfluous tools that you can get rid of. Until a few weeks ago, even our friends at Delish didn't understand the complete potential of the whisk and that it could replace six utensils in your drawer. And now we're here to tell you about the one and only countertop appliance you really, truly need to buy: a high-power blender.

I realize I might upset a lot of you with this one, but before you fire off your arguments for your beloved toaster oven or precious slow cooker, you need to hear me out. A super-charged blender can do so much more than you realize—so much more than stir together a post-workout smoothie.

It's so useful that even the New York Times lists it as the only essential kitchen tool beyond a list of basic knifes, spoons, pots, and pans. In many aspects it replaces other appliances, but most importantly it completes jobs you couldn't accomplish without one. Let's be real: you can't hand-cut ice or hand-grind pesto quite the same way the blades on one of these babies could. With other appliances, you can get the job done by other means (looking at you, toaster oven, slow cooker, stand mixers, rice cooker, juicer).

A souped-up blender can get all of these tasks done in a breeze: juice without a juicer; make pesto, peanut butter, hummus, and other spreads; blend and boil soups; whip up smoothies; crush ice; mix dry and wet ingredients like a stand mixer; prepare baby food; simmer sauces; the list goes on. You just have to make sure you're investing in a top-notch model like the Vitamix or the Blendtec to get the most bang for your buck—and to toss all your other cabinet-dominating appliances for good.

We understand the instinct. Poultry sometimes feels like it could use a little wash ― it can have a somewhat slimy quality to it. But whatever you do this Thanksgiving, absolutely DO NOT wash your bird.

According to the USDA, rinsing your turkey will not get rid of unwanted bacteria ― that is virtually impossible. Actually, washing it can increase the chance of spreading bacteria. This is because water that splashes from the bird onto countertops or other surfaces spreads the bacteria and creates a real possibility for cross contamination.

“The risk of cross-contamination through washing poultry is far greater than shoving it in the oven without washing it, which makes the risk almost zero,” Fergus Clydesdale, head of the food science department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, told The New York Times.",2016-11-20 13:45:00
68,"Donating goods to large national or international companies costs more to ship, and often goods don't meet health standards. However, if you donate to local food banks, it's totally fine and you should do so. ",http://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a40514/why-you-shouldnt-donate-canned-goods-to-charity/,"The holiday season is a time of goodwill and giving, and for many families that means rounding up canned foods, creating care packages, or knitting scarves for those in need. But if you're not careful, your well-meaning actions could be entirely in vain.

That's because a deluge of dry goods during the Christmas season creates more work for volunteers, who are tasked with sorting through warehouses full of groceries, blankets, and clothing. ""The direct donation of goods, especially in the wake of a disaster, can truly cause more harm than good...[creating] a second crisis of sorts,"" writes Abby Glassenberg, the blogger behind While She Naps and wife of a charity fundraiser.

In fact, there are numerous reasons many organizations prefer monetary over physical donations, according to blogger Edward McIntyre:

Shipping and storing donations costs more than buying new items.

Many donated items don't meet the health and safety standards for redistribution.

Larger organizations like the Red Cross don't need them because they have pre-existing arrangements for food, shelter, and clothing.

Perhaps most importantly, the collective buying power of a large nonprofit can stretch your dollar beyond anything you'd be able to buy or make on your own, writes McIntyre.

If you really want to make a difference, your best bet is writing a check to a trustworthy organization that you've vetted through Charity Navigator. This sentiment is especially true in the aftermath of a natural disaster, when those affected may not have the means to store foods. (If they've been displaced from their homes, a one-way bus ticket to a relative's house is going to help more than a boatload of canned beans.)

The one exception to this rule is local food banks, which often request non-perishable items like canned soups, peanut butter, and cereals. Find one in your community at Feeding America, but be sure to confirm that it accepts food donations from individuals, as many do not.

For people who are short on cash but flush with time and/or crafting skills, Glassenberg suggests selling your crafts to raise money for your designated charity, either at a fundraising event or via online marketplace like Etsy. Just be sure to clearly state what percentage of your proceeds go to charity, and keep enough of the earnings to recoup the costs of materials and supplies.

Volunteering is another great option, and bringing the whole family along gives children the opportunity to experience the spirit of giving.

69,Bangs. ,http://www.prevention.com/beauty/haircut-makes-you-look-years-younger,"Photo by Sharon Kennedy/Getty Images

In case you needed proof that bangs do, as hairstylists always promise, make you look younger, how's this: At 17 years older than the legal drinking limit, I was carded the other night at a wine store! For the first time in Dionysus-knows-when. (Lose up to 25 pounds in 2 months—and look more radiant than ever—with the new Younger In 8 Weeks plan!)

This isn't the first such bangs-take-off-years incident I've experienced: Several years ago, right after a haircut involving bangs, I went out for pizza with my friend Jolene—who had also gotten bangs, because, you know, that's what girls do when they're not having pillow fights—and the waiter asked if we wanted a drink: ""Like a root beer or sumthin'?"" he chirped. Uh huh.

But here's the secret: Not just any old fringe will do. The keys to young-looking bangs, according to hairstylist Matt Fugate of the Sally Hershberger Downtown salon (who snipped my bangs a few weeks ago), are as follows:

1. They should be thick. Wispy pieces can make hair look thin. And anthropologically speaking, thick, lush hair is a sign of youth and fertility. You know, if looking fertile is your thing.

2. They shouldn't be totally blunt. ""I love my razor,"" says Fugate, who uses it to ever so slightly vary the lengths of the ends.

3. They should hit between the eyebrows and tops of your eyes. Super-short bangs can be cute, but they have a retro feel…which, visually, can = old.

70,"Physically she felt the effects of working out, but mentally her concentration went down. ",http://www.wellandgood.com/good-sweat/cubii-at-desk-elliptical-review/slide/3/,"Y ou have a never-ending to-do list at work, a friend who keeps trying to book you for a catch-up dinner, and that pile of laundry overflowing from your hamper that needs to be done tonight—and you really want to squeeze in a workout before the new episode of ou have a never-ending to-do list at work, a friend who keeps trying to book you for a catch-up dinner, and that pile of laundry overflowing from your hamper that needs to be done tonight—and you really want to squeeze in a workout before the new episode of The Voice. Sound familiar?

One possible solution: an at-work workout. Yes, you can lift and squeeze those Kombucha bottles over your head when your boss isn't looking, but in terms of seamlessly toning while sending an email to a colleague about a new proposal, you'll need something that ""blends in.""

Which is why, when I received an email about Cubii—the small, portable, at-desk elliptical—I was instantly intrigued. ""Burn up to 100-150 calories per hour,"" they promised, all while sitting at my desk and writing about the latest in printed leggings and super-hydrating smoothies? Um, where do I sign up?!

Cubii is advertised as the ultimate portable, quiet (so no side-eyeing from your coworkers), and ergonomic (which means your knees don't bang into the bottom of your desk every time you pedal) desk-side exercise equipment. With a price tag that hovers in the mid-three digits—at $347, it's the equivalent of a multi-month gym membership)—I couldn't just take their word for it.

Related Stories

So, I decided to take the Cubii challenge. Here's what happened.

After a fairly easily assembly—a screwdriver is provided—I hit one minor speed bump: Although they wisely provide stoppers for under-the-wheels of your chair, the wheels of my chair were too big and I was sliding backwards. After a quick chair-swap for a standard four-post chair from the conference room, I was off!

The Cubii allows eight different levels of resistance and I instinctively turned mine to a level seven—one too many Barry's Bootcamp classes has taught me I can always go a bit harder. Anything lower than that just felt a bit too low-resistance for me—and besides, I was trying to get a genuine burn in. While I wasn't sweating as if I were on a full-size elliptical, I quickly discovered that if I engaged my core and sat up straight, I definitely felt the workout tingle.

While I wasn't sweating as if I were on a full-size elliptical, I quickly discovered that if I engaged my core and sat up straight, I definitely felt the workout tingle.

Thanks to the free Cubii app, I learned that at a level seven, I could burn a whopping four calories per minute and my heart rate would go to what they called ""moderate exercise""—I'd call it a slightly-less-than-brisk walk. In other words, it wasn't exactly replacing my SoulCycle habit, but at least it was doing something. I aimed for about 30-60 minutes of activity per day, which added up to about an extra 1,000 calories a week that I wouldn't have burned otherwise. (Unless my super-fast typing skills add up to that much? TBD.)

But while my physical movement felt great, my mind took a glacial hit. I suddenly had trouble paying attention to the article at-hand, and was focusing more on how many RPMs (rotations-per-minute) I was doing rather than what Lea Michele and Gigi Hadid were doing.

Turns out, I'm not alone in this. ""I personally think that at-desk exercise equipment is a bit of a scam,"" Noam Tamir, a personal trainer and owner of TS Fitness in New York City, told me. (Cue sad trombone.) ""If you're actually working around the clock, sitting at a desk, and having absolutely no time to work out, then it can be beneficial. But if you're already working out outside of the office or can make time away from your desk to walk, jog, or even take the stairs, then there's no need for the bulky—and often expensive—equipment.""

Plus there's the whole multitasking thing. ""I'm a firm believe in doing one thing at a time,"" Tamir adds. ""If you're at work, then you should work, and if you're focusing enough, you should be able finish a bit earlier in order to work out outside of the office. If you're distracting yourself with less-than-effective exercise equipment, not only are you most likely slowing down your workflow, but you're working less muscle than you would somewhere else.""

""If you're already working out outside of the office, then there's no need for the bulky—and often expensive—equipment.""

Tamir's solution is simple: Get up and move every 30-40 minutes. He says that if you focus your mind during work hours, getting up once an hour to stretch your legs won't slow you down, but it will do enough to keep your blood flowing and muscles loose—and then you can get your serious sweat on pre- or post-cube.

My recommendation: Whipping up your next Big Idea while pedaling away might be a challenge, but if you're seriously time-challenged, it's a decent option for a not-so-ideal situation. I found the Cubii's rhythmic motion well-suited for routine or methodical work, like answering email and clerical tasks (hello, Excel). And one thing's for certain: the ergonomic claims don't lie. At 5'8"", I have slightly longer-than-average legs and my knees never once hit my desk.

Or, you know, maybe just take the stairs at lunch?

But it’s not in the eggs themselves, perhaps, that the secret lies, but in their preparation ― or in her case, lack thereof. Morano has said she’s eaten two eggs raw for decades since a doctor told her it would help her anemia. (The cookies sound much more appetizing.)

Other than that, the oldest woman says she’s lived a long life thanks to not being “dominated” by anyone and to staying single since she divorced in her late 30s.

Step 1: Lightly tap your brush onto your cream or powder blush, then suck in your cheeks a bit, so you can see their hollows. Your blush should be applied right above that area. ""That's your cheekbone, where you would naturally flush if you went for a jog or spent a day at the beach,"" Radow explains.

Step 2: With light, quick strokes, brush the blush along your cheekbone, starting at the apple and blending it back toward your ear (the pigment should fade as you go, so it's not a stripe).

It's a historic single-family house that's on the market in Hercules, California for $1. Yes, you saw that correctly and, no, it shouldn't be followed by ""thousand"" or ""million."" But even so, no one wants to buy it.

Why? Well, back in 2010, the town of Hercules bought the house, known as Historic Home Number 54 and called ""Queen Anne"" for it's Victorian style, for a buck with plans to renovate and preserve it. Then they cut the home in half to move it to the city's corporation yard and get to work. However, they eventually decided they couldn't devote the money or resources needed to finish the project and put it back on the market.

Today, whoever buys this home will have to move it off of the city's property and use their own money to restore it — which includes, you know, putting the two halves back together. On the list of repairs also includes a new roof, windows, electrical, paint, and plaster. ""If we can preserve it, even if it's not in our own community, that would be the preferred option,"" Hercules Planning Director, Holly Smyth, told Realtor.

If no one buys the home, she says it will have to be demolished — which would be such a shame, because look how cute the home used to be as recently as in 2005.

Fingers crossed someone snatches it up, then blogs about the experience so we can live vicariously through them.

Anybody who claims there is—like ""only post once a day"" or ""only post pictures in artfully edited batches of no more than five""—is full of it.

But that said, if your ultimate goal on Facebook is to stay connected with old and new friends, you might wonder what causes some people, maybe even actual friends from the real world, to mysteriously dump you.

Is it something you said? Or more specifically, wrote?

MORE: The Better Man Project: 2,476 tips to keep you happy and healthy for life

Christopher Sibona, PhD, a researcher at the University of Colorado Denver, has studied why people unfriend their Facebook friends. The most common reasons:

1) Polarizing posts about politics and religion.

2) Inappropriate posts with sexist and/or racist remarks.

3) Banal topics.

The first two should be no-brainers. But number 3? That one is a little trickier. What exactly counts as ""banal""?

Can you ever really be sure? After all, what one person finds fresh and original, somebody else could dismiss as trite and hackneyed. Can you ever win if you're trying to please everyone?

Actually, trying to please everyone is often what gets us into trouble. Michael Stefanone, PhD, a communications professor at the University of Buffalo, says that many Facebook users make bad social media decisions because of something called the Multiple Audience Problem.

""When we post on social media, our audiences are super-diverse, especially compared to when we hang out with people offline,"" he says. ""Online, my audience includes colleagues, old girlfriends, potential girlfriends, casual and close friends, parents, and even grandparents.""

Each of these subgroups has different expectations of your behavior, Stefanone says. And when you try to please everybody—or don't consider their particular beliefs or values—you're going to end up pissing off at least some of them.

MORE: 5 Things You Should Never Say To Her

However, there are some status updates that we can all agree are just terrible, and you should stop posting them immediately.

Here are three of the most egregious—and dare we say, banal—status updates to avoid at all costs.

1. Anything Purposively Vague

These posts tend to be short and don't share any details that give even a hint of a context.

Updates like ""It's been one of those days"" or ""Mind blown"" or ""I can't even"" or ""Please pray for me.""

It's like you're dropping hints, and you want your friends to ask questions to get it out of you.

""We're all busy,"" says Stefanone. ""I don't have time to take this bait and ask you for more information.""

Rest assured, ""bait"" is exactly how your readers are interpreting a post like this.

""People do not like being manipulated, especially if they are drawn in without even a topic,"" says Karen North, PhD, a professor of digital social media at the USC Annenberg School.

2. The Humble Brag

Consider a status update like this: ""Got accepted into both Harvard AND Princeton, and now I have to decide between them. What a morning!""

Or this: ""Bumped into John Krasinski at the coffee shop, and we ended up talking for so long, I was totally late for work!""

North calls this a ""transparent attempt to fish for compliments.""

3. The Unfriending Warning

If you're going to unfriend somebody on Facebook—either because of something they've specifically done to offend you, or as a general cleaning house (eliminating all the people you don't actually know)—then just go ahead and do it. There's no need for an announcement.

""In the real world, the vast majority of friendships fade without an active declaration of 'you are no longer my friend,'"" says Sibona.

Online unfriending is fine, but when you make threats in advance, ""Not only can this be perceived as poor manners and rude, but with online communities, it is even worse since people really do not have the opportunity to resolve whatever problems led to the threat,"" says North.

",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/loneliness_us_581bb7f8e4b0aac624834ae3,"Loneliness isn’t something we talk about often. There’s a certain shame in admitting you don’t feel as connected to other people as you’d like to be.

But the cure for loneliness isn’t always to spend more time with other people. It’s actually embracing loneliness for yourself.

Lonely feelings are a natural and necessary part of being human, philosopher Alain de Botton suggests in a new video from The School of Life.

78,"The popular verse - I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, As long as I’m living my baby you’ll be - is about (the author's) stillborn babies. ",http://faithit.com/love-you-forever-book-author-robert-munsch-explains-about-stillborns/,"685.7k SHARES Share Tweet Pin

Robert Munsch’s Love You Forever book was published once upon a 1986, but its legacy lives on even today.

As a kindergartner, I remember sitting cross-legged and staring doe-eyed at my teacher, Mrs. Duff, as she read that Love You Forever book to us over and over during story time. You’d think it would eventually get old, but our whole class sat in a circle just as mesmerized by the tale each time it was read as though it was the first time our ears heard those memorable words that made our eyes well up with tears. You’ve probably heard at least one of the love you forever book quotes, such as:

I’ll love you forever,

I’ll like you for always,

As long as I’m living my baby you’ll be.

What’s the Love You Forever book basically about?

If you haven’t read the Love You Forever book, in summary, the story chronicles the life of a mother and son as the boy grows up. Through the sleepless nights as an infant to his ‘terrible two’s‘ and his pre-teen years where mom wanted to “sell him to the zoo,” she still loved him fearlessly and unconditionally, always ending the night with the same song as she rocked her boy to bed…

I’ll love you forever,

I’ll like you for always,

As long as I’m living my baby you’ll be.

As the boy grows older and leaves home to start his own family, his mother occasionally sneaks into his bedroom to rock her grown man with her customary lullaby. (In hindsight, as an adult, that part sounds a tad creepier than it did when I was five, but the moral of the story is still undeniably sweet.)

Eventually in the love you forever book, his mom grows old and very sick and she calls her son over to sing the song to him, but she could only make it halfway through. Knowing that she wouldn’t be able to hold on much longer, he began rocking her in his arms, singing the lullaby full of love that had carried him through his largely defiant life. Afterward, he went home saddened but found new hope in rocking his own baby girl to sleep with the same heartfelt words that would forever carry on his mother’s legacy.

What’s the Love You Forever book really about?

Though the message in this story and the song seems pretty clear, it’s probably not about what you think. It is actually inspired by the author’s two stillborn babies…thus the “my baby you’ll be” part.

Munsch shared this statement on his website:

I made that up after my wife and I had two babies born dead. The song was my song to my dead babies. For a long time I had it in my head and I couldn’t even sing it because every time I tried to sing it I cried. It was very strange having a song in my head that I couldn’t sing. For a long time it was just a song, but one day, while telling stories at a big theatre at the University of Guelph, it occurred to me that I might be able to make a story around the song. Out popped Love You Forever, pretty much the way it is in the book.

Wow. It’s amazing that this explanation coming out 30 years later can totally alter the meaning of this book. Yet in a sense, it’s all the same—perhaps that’s why this timeless tale has lived on.

On the face of it, the story seems to be about a mom who who will never stop loving her son as big as he grows or as long as he lives, but really, it’s the same for stillborn babies and miscarriages. Just because they were taken to heaven early, doesn’t mean their parents’ love died along with their flesh. In the same way, they will be loved forever, long after they’re gone.

So for the big boys, the baby girls and the little angels in heaven, this tune will remain forever true:

I’ll love you forever,

I’ll like you for always,

As long as I’m living my baby you’ll be.

Now, those are 18 beautiful words worth remembering for always. ❤",2016-11-07 06:47:41
