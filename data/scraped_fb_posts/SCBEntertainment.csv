The Israeli actress has appeared in some of the biggest movies of the last several years, including four entries in the Fast and the Furious franchise and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. She’ll also reprise the role of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman in the DC Extended Universe’s Justice League, which is due out later this year. But if Gadot’s face is nigh inescapable, she’s not yet a household name—and even people who do know her name usually say it wrong.

Perhaps it’s the similarity to the absent title figure of Samuel Beckett’s most famous play, but the go-to pronunciation for Gadot’s surname tends to treat it as if it’s French: Guh-DOH. But as mentioned above, Gadot is not French: She’s Israeli, and she pronounces her name, quiet sensibly, in the Israeli fashion, which is to say with a hard T and a short O: Guh-DOTT. Here’s Jimmy Kimmel, making a good effort but not quite getting it right.

But why subject yourself to the imprecision of phonetic spellings when you can learn from the woman herself? Here’s Gal Gadot saying “Gal Gadot,” followed by a long string of people following her lead.

One last tip. The correct pronunciation of “I am upset that a movie that is opening on well over 2,000 screens will have a tiny number of individual showings whose audience is voluntarily limited to women” is “Boo-HOO.”",2017-06-04 14:41:29

Season 7 of Game of Thrones is teased in new trailer

The four-legged star behind Jon Snow's faithful companion passed away this week at the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary

Game Of Thrones author George R.R. Martin has made the sad announcement today that the real-life wolf who played Ghost is dead.

Jon Snow's faithful companion was played by an albino Arctic Wolf and lived at the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary in Nex Mexico, USA.

The four-legged star of HBO's fantasy drama, who passed away this week, was part of a pack that lived at the rescue centre supported by the Martin family.

Breaking the news on Twitter, Martin said: ""In loving memory of the real life Ghost from the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary. He passed this week & he will be missed. R.I.P""

Fans of the show took to Twitter to give their sympathies and hope that the direwolf won't be killed off in the books or the show.

Ghost is one of the only two remaining Stark direwolves in Game Of Thrones, but Nymeria has been missing since the first season.

The runt of the litter, who was gifted to illegitimate Stark Jon Snow, quickly became popular amongst fans during his time at the Wall.

Ghost was clearly distinguishable from the other family pets due to his albino fur and striking red eyes.

Game Of Thrones fans have had to deal with the tragic deaths of four direwolves on the show, but hope Ghost could possibly sit at his master's side by the Iron Throne.

In season 1, Northern Inuit Dogs played the young puppies, with Sophie Turner adopting the dog who played Lady.

Game Of Thrones viewer took to Twitter to give their sympathies for the real-life ghost.

One fan said: ""Aww thats so sad RIP beautiful creature!""

Another added: ""Losing a friend is never easy. May he be not only missed but also remembered.""

A third said: ""A great man once said...'The lone wolf dies but the pack survives""

Meanwhile, fans of the show have found out that they won't have to wait too long for its return.

The release date for season 7 has finally been announced in a brand new teaser

Fans of the hit HBO series have been forced to wait over a year for their next fix of Westeros, but the wait will soon be over.

The next series will premiere on July 16th, where viewers will see the battle for the Seven Kingdoms get into full swing as Daenerys Targaryen sails across from Essos to face Queen Cersei.

However, the teaser shows the danger about to come down from the north, as the camera pans slowly moves out from the evil blue eye of the Night King to reveal his dark face.

The official Game Of Thrones twitter account tweeted: "" #GoTS7 begins 7.16 on @HBO . #GameofThrones

While the battle for the Iron Throne wages on in the south, the threat everyone should really be focusing on is the White Walkers.

Fans couldn't contain their excitement over the new teaser, but were slightly disappointed that another full trailer has not been released

Just three weeks after the first trailer dropped, new snaps were released showing Queen Cersei sitting regally on the Iron Throne with her brother-slash-lover Jaime Lannister standing beside her with his impressive sword on display.

Cersei - who spent the last season behind stripped naked and humiliated as punishment for her infidelity - wears a simple metal crown and chain mail armour, suggesting she'll be doing battle to cement her status as royalty in the upcoming series.

Other pictures show Lyanna Mormont, who up until Season 6 was a little-known character until she proclaimed her house for Jon Stark, declaring him the King of the North.

The upcoming series also catches up with Gilly and Samwell Tarly, who can be seen studying some books in a dark room. Gilly is reading, suggesting Samwell has achieved his goal of educating her since they fled from her abusive husband.

Daenerys Targaryen is back, looking serious as she surveys a scene in front of her. She wears a dragon badge on her outfit, but there are no signs of her three dragon 'offspring'.

Tyrion - by now Daenerys' Hand, or chief advisor - is in place beside her, alongside Varys 'the Spider', Grey Worm and Missandei.

As last month's trailer showed, the battle to rule the seven kingdoms has been absolutely ruthless so far, and that's not about to change.",2017-05-24 16:34:33
2,"""...I always thought I was the most outsider, weird person in the movie, and, 'Why was I cast in it?' and I had no voice."" ",http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1653270/why-diane-keaton-hasnt-watched-the-godfather-in-30-years,"While Diane Keaton might not be the first name that comes to mind when you think about The Godfather, her performance as Michael Corleone's long suffering wife Kaye Adams is still a fine and memorable turn in the classic movie. It turns out that Diane Keaton herself has actually been disregarding her work in The Godfather, too. The legendary actress has now admitted that, until recently, she hadn't watched The Godfather in around 30 years because she always saw herself as the outsider in the film. Diane Keaton admitted,

I was so shocked because I never did pay that much attention to The Godfather because I always thought I was the most outsider, weird person in the movie, and, 'Why was I cast in it?' and I had no voice. But then I had a couple of good scenes with Al.

Of course, Diane Keaton isn't wrong with her assumption, because Kay Adams-Corleone is one of the few non-Italian characters in both The Godfather and The Godfather Part II. In fact, Kay Adams is constantly kept at arms length regarding the family business throughout the films, and as things escalate throughout the second movie, the audience even sees her become a prisoner in her own home. Still, The Godfather is a movie that's on cable fairly often, and you'd have at least expected Diane Keaton to have a quick peek at her performance at some point over the last thirty years, especially since she's in the iconic final shot of the first film.

Diane Keaton admitted at the Tribeca Film Festival that she finally sat herself down to re-watch The Godfather for the first time in three decades recently. As you'd expect the actress was blown away by just how engrossing and gripping the gangster epic was, especially because she still found herself overwhelmed by the film even though she was watching it on a computer. Diane Keaton recalled,

I saw it on my computer. I hadn't seen it for I think about 30 years. And I looked at 1, and I just remember all the people, I couldn't handle it, it was so astonishing, it was so beautiful, and everybody is so great in it, and the music, and every choice [Francis Ford Coppola] made. And that damn Talia -- I saw you in that scene with all the fighting. And then you had slow, long scenes. Everything was astonishing to me. And I was totally surprised because I didn't expect it. And on a fucking computer.

Diane Keaton made the above revelations during the emotional reunion of The Godfather's cast and crew at the closing night of The Tribeca Film Festival on Saturday night, which came after the first two films were screened back to back over an absorbing 7 and a half hour period. As well as Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and co-writer and director Francis Ford Coppola took part in the wide-ranging discussion, which was hosted by director Taylor Hackford and was supposed to last 45 minutes but actually went on for an hour and twenty. I will forever be thanking my lucky stars that I was in attendance at the once in a life-time event, and stay glued to CinemaBlend over the next few days for further stories and revelations from the panel.

In addition, Paramount will release all three films in the epic Godfather crime saga on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD on Tuesday, May 9.",2017-05-13 11:00:00

Disney is slowly collecting a nice slew of voice talent for their upcoming live-action Lion King. First, there was Donald Glover playing Simba, along with James Earl Jones returning as the voice the wise Mufasa. The studio is pretty keen on snagging Queen B to play Queen of the Jungle, Nala. And now, they’ve announced who’s taking on the roles of jungle best-friends forever and ever:

Timone and Pumbaa will be played by – drumroll, please — Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner.

9,The Walking Dead has become more about gore than storytelling. ,http://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/fans-leaving-show-season-walking-dead/,"HAS THE WALKING DEAD KILLED THEIR FANS?

According to The Verge, and several Twitter fans of The Walking Dead, many die-hards are leaving the show this season after the opening episode of Season 7 where we lost Glenn and Abraham. They’re also leaving in troves as the ratings have dropped to an all time low since Season 3.

Rest assured: these numbers DO predict the future of the shows that run on TV. With the recent backlash of gore, Walking Dead even had to cut back the blood in Fat Joey’s death.

They are listening to the fans, but some have gone completely rogue and are boycotting the show at every turn.

The main reason people are leaving isn’t just because two leads were killed, where only one was expected to die. If that were the case, there wouldn’t be anyone left to watch Game of Thrones, where leads die off in packs.

The reason people are leaving is that they feel the creators are more about the shock value of the show than the story. Essentially, the series has gotten to a point where it’s more into manipulating its audience than being faithful.

Obviously, this is somewhat of a double-edged sword. While it can’t be denied, why would fans want everything exactly like the comic series? Have we not developed a degree of trust in a show so powerful? Is it possible that these thoughts are just from fair-weather fans?

Blaming Showrunner Scott Gimple

Some fans blame new showrunner, Scott Gimble, saying he took an emotionally charged show that involved zombie deaths and character growth and turned it into torture porn, rather than a network drama.

The evidence for this idea started in Season 6 when we went down the rabbit hole as the gang was trying to escape. Again, this can be argued both ways. Were we manipulated or were we given a chance to feel scared for our heroes?

Other points of manipulation include Glenn’s dumpster death (which even involved removing his name from the credits). They leaked bashed-in-head photos online. And yes, they filmed everyone to avoid actual leaks, but this seems no different than Christopher Nolan keeping his work private. They kept Negan’s identity secret. But again, this is somewhat of a stretch and is more about storytelling. Consider the opening of The Departed where we don’t see Nicholson’s face, but merely a silhouette for the first few scenes to add drama.

Will Negan Make Rick Stronger?

Whatever your opinion, this all lead up to the premiere where Glenn and Abraham were killed by the hands of Negan in a horrific manner involving Lucille, Negan’s trustworthy baseball bat.

Later, when Negan was attempting to force Rick to cut off his son’s arm, some refer to this as cruel and violent, as well as cheap tension. Again, this feels like something necessary to change Carl and Rick’s relationship within the story. To a degree, whatever Negan does will make Rick stronger.

While it would appear to be best to defend the series, those who are leaving seem to have their minds set. They feel that the show has left its roots of character development, which could tie in with the fact that we already know King Ezekiel’s background, something that may have been kept secret longer before.

Whatever these quitters feel about this new fork in the road, one can’t help but think of a favorite team’s losing season after a big win. Fewer jerseys line the store windows, and ticket prices are lower, but maybe it’s because the fans just haven’t screamed loud enough.

We’ll find out soon enough.

",http://en.newsner.com/crowd-asks-springsteen-to-play-another-singer-s-song-his-response-leaves-them-speechless/about/music,"These days, performers usually prepare every detail of their concerts ahead of time. Especially when they are world-class artists like Bruce Springsteen.

But if you’re accomplished as much as Springsteen has, you can pretty much do whatever you want.

So when Bruce saw a sign in the audience during a concert in Leipzig, Germany asking him to play “You Can Never Tell” from the cult movie “Pulp Fiction,” he handled it, well, like a boss.

Bruce started by trying a couple of different keys and consulting with his band. In front of a crowd of 45,000, “The Boss” was straining. Not even the band could hide their surprise, and I can’t even imagine how the promoters and organizers were feeling.

Then a few seconds later, Bruce and the band gave it a shot—and I need hardly mention that the performance was a smashing success.

11,"The lyric ""Only shootin' stars break the mold"" was originally ""Wave bye bye to your soul"" ",http://www.spin.com/2017/02/original-handwritten-lyrics-show-smash-mouths-all-star-was-almost-a-much-darker-song/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=timeline,"Smash Mouth’s “All Star” is a motivational speech wrapped in a pop song. “Hey now! You’re a rock star, get the show on, get paid,” and so on. There doesn’t seem to be much ambiguity in its message: being an all star is cool, being a rock star is cool, getting paid is definitely cool, and hey, you never know–if you give yourself a shot and aim for the skies, you might break the mold and become an all star, too. Cool!

But according to an original draft of the lyrics, penned by original Smash Mouth guitarist Greg Camp and tweeted out from the band’s account this afternoon, there might be a darker side to living out your dreams of riches and celebrity.

At the end of the chorus, there’s a line crossed out, with the lyric that made the final cut–“And only shooting stars [will] break the mold”–shoved into the margin. Look closely, and you can read the original draft underneath the scribbles: “Wave bye bye to your soul.”

That single line puts a darkly ironic twist on a song that otherwise seems pretty naive: sure, you can live only for fun, hit the ground running, take the backstreets, and set your world on fire–you’ll shine, you’ll glow, but you might lose the very thing that makes you human in the process. Being a rock star is fun and all, but sooner or later, you end up alone on the tour bus, surrounded by empty bottles, staring into a tiny handheld mirror, wondering where your high school sweetheart is and what things would have been like if you’d taken a different path. (Or maybe I’m just projecting.)

Look at the top of the lyrics sheet (which the band has tweeted out at least once before), and you’ll also notice a subtle perspective shift in the first verse. “All Star” originally opened not with an unnamed somebody looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an “L” on her forehead, but with the song’s narrator, Mr. All Star himself, as the dumb one. What does it all mean?

With the “bye bye to your soul” thing in mind, all sorts of other hidden depths of “All Star” start to reveal themselves. There’s that glancing reference to climate change in the second verse, for one thing. And isn’t the assertion in the chorus that all that glitters is in fact gold just a little to peppy and on-the-nose to be taken at face value? The darkness and mystery implied in “All Star” inspired one incredibly devoted Smash Mouth fan to compile a Reddit post two years ago, explaining in detail why “Smash Mouth’s song “All Star” is about the exact opposite everyone thinks it is.”

We may never know the band’s reason for cutting the “soul” line and replacing it with much more saccharine lyrics about shooting stars. But if “All Star” really is about the ultimate hollowness of contemporary life, I guess there’s a lot more going on in the opening sequence of Shrek than we gave it credit for, too.",2017-04-28 17:29:00
12,Joss Whedon has to be willing to work on the series. ,http://epicstream.com/news/Fox-is-Open-to-Rebooting-Firefly-But-Only-Under-This-Condition,"Fox already brought more episodes of X-Files and Prison Break before, but some fans are wondering if there's a chance that they would reboot Firefly. Creator Joss Whedon's sci-fi western was canceled after its first season, but the story was continued in a film titled Serenity. Fans of the show, a.k.a. Browncoats, have been wishing for the franchise's revival since well...it's cancellation. And while many believe that it's too late for a second season, Fox Broadcasting President of Entertainment, David Madden is open to more Firefly if Whedon is.

While at the panel at last month's TCA 2017, Madden told Rotten Tomatoes that he's open for a Firefly reboot (via TV Overmind). but Madden only wants it if Whedon is involved. It would be awesome to see fresher episodes of this beloved sci-fi western franchise, and I'm sure its former cast members would be open to reunite in a new show, but the Avengers: Age of Ultron director is currently busy making films.

After Age of Ultron was released in theaters, Whedon told Collider: ""there are rights [issues] between Fox and Universal because one had the show and one had the movie, so it gets a little funky fresh with that.""

13,Achieved 100% ScreenTest score. ,http://hellogiggles.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-perfect-score/,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" just did something no other Marvel movie has done before

Just when you thought you couldn’t get more excited for the next installment of Marvel’s Guardians franchise, there’s more good news. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 got a perfect score in a test screening — which is, so far, the highest score a Marvel movie has ever snagged. That’s just downright the highest score any film can snag.

Now hold up, what’s a test screening? Test screenings are early screenings shown to audiences to get an idea of how the film will perform. Even Iron Man 3 and Avengers only got scores in the 90s out of 100. But Vol. 2 walked away will a 100. You know Baby Groot is excited.

The film won’t hit theaters until May 5th but after the success of the first Guardians of the Galaxy and the continued success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films in general, it feels like the pressure is mounting on each film to be better than the ones before. So a high audience testing score is certainly a reason to celebrate! Although, according to Deadline, Marvel uses mostly friends and family for their test screenings in order to prevent leaks. Of course, that could result in higher scores than random people.

Director James Gunn has been posting lots of fun behind-the-scenes photos on his Instagram account which has only increased anticipation for the film. It looks epic.

Audiences are certainly excited about the film as well tweeting their excitement every time a new image, teaser, or tidbit of information is released.

15,"Basically, HBO handed back the rights because they didn't understand the script. ",https://www.avclub.com/article/it-took-more-ian-mcshane-and-prayer-get-american-g-254290,"The All-Father uses emoji. “This is the first time I’m saying this in an interview,” American Gods co-showrunner Michael Green divulges when talking with The A.V. Club last week. “Ian McShane: He makes fun of Instagram, Twitter. ‘Oh, that social thing I leave that to you’—he will text with emojis and GIFs. It means we’re in a world where we all have a much more complicated relationship with technology.”

Advertisement

That’s surprising news from an actor who joked with The A.V. Club about turning his back on modern technology, and even more notable considering the character he plays in Green’s series represents the world before gadgets and smiley-face icons. American Gods casts McShane as Mr. Wednesday, a.k.a. All-Father, a.k.a. the Norse deity Odin. He’s the leader of a group of old gods now moored in the U.S. and prepping for war against the new ones, whose ranks include physical manifestations of present-day obsessions like, yes, technology. The old gods are representative of the legends people brought with them when they came to America; the new ones are what we’ve become consumed by. When the novel by Neil Gaiman came out in 2001, emoji weren’t part of the cultural dialogue. Now the already acclaimed adaptation is set to debut in a much different landscape, one in which an eggplant can be used to convey something dirty and stories about immigration are inherently political. But when or how it was going to be adapted wasn’t always a given.

American Gods isn’t an easily contained or explained narrative. It’s a sprawling, complicated epic that centers on Shadow (Ricky Whittle), who, just out of prison, is hired (or, perhaps more accurately, is coerced) into working for Wednesday after discovering that Shadow’s wife, Laura (Emily Browning), has died in a car crash while having an affair with his best friend, Robbie (Dane Cook). Along the way the new gods like Media (Gillian Anderson) try to woo Shadow to join their side or threaten him. And all the while Gaiman weaves historical tales of how these deities wound up in the country. Remove the fantasy elements, and the show’s about how this nation was built on the many faiths of countless people who traveled from far away to get here.

For Gaiman, the process of getting American Gods to the screen wasn’t a particularly lengthy one. (The author reserves that designation for the constantly in-flux movie based on his comic The Sandman.) Throughout the years, he fielded offers from filmmakers intrigued by the text but baffled by how to translate it. “I write a book, it’s obviously unfilmable,” he says. “I do not worry about the fact that it’s unfilmable. Because I’m writing an unfilmable book, I have a great time with that. So people phone me up and say, ‘Hello, I am a famous director that you have heard of. I just read your book. I think it would make an amazing movie, but how would you make this into a movie?’ And I say, ‘I don’t know.’ I say, ‘Honestly, I think at the point where you make it a 120-page script, you’ve thrown away anything that makes it interesting,’ and so nothing ever happened.”

In 2011, however, he joined forces with Tom Hanks’ production company, Playtone, to develop an American Gods series for HBO. News that the project was underway broke just before HBO launched a different fantasy property: Game Of Thrones. “By the time we’d handed our script in, our nice, smart exec had gone, and the people remaining were going, ‘We don’t really know what it is, and we don’t really understand it, and we don’t like it that much,’” Gaiman said. “So we did two drafts and a polish, and they gave us the rights back.” The author explains he was “relieved” when HBO got out of the picture, which ultimately led him to Starz and Bryan Fuller, the creator of visually marvelous worlds ranging from the whimsical (Pushing Daisies) to the nightmarish (Hannibal). What sold Gaiman on Fuller was not that he had a vision for tackling the challenging material immediately in mind, but that he loved the book. Fuller remembers Gaiman coming to visit him in Toronto; when he was asked if he wanted to do it, he said yes—with Michael Green, creator of the biblical-themed and short-lived NBC series Kings, which starred McShane. These days, Green is racking up blockbuster credits like the acclaimed Wolverine movie Logan, the Blade Runner sequel, and the new Murder On The Orient Express.

The producers and cast acknowledge that they did not have any easy task ahead of them. Actor Pablo Schreiber—who plays the tall, nasty leprechaun Mad Sweeney—says he was initially perplexed by how it was all going to come together. “I was just blown away by the world,” he recalls. “I was like, ‘What is this magical piece of writing?’ And so crazy, like how is this a TV show? How does it work? Then, after getting the job, I went back and read the book, and it started to make a little more sense, although I still couldn’t really imagine how it was going to be a TV show.”

Even before he took on the part of old god Mr. Nancy, Gaiman’s version of the folkloric arachnid Anansi, Orlando Jones had affection for what Gaiman had put on the page. “The core principle obviously is you can manifest your thoughts into realities if you believe,” he says. “An interesting and powerful concept but a difficult visual to realize.”

Green and Fuller came to the concept as fans, but that doesn’t mean they were 100 percent faithful. “We wanted to recreate our experience, and by definition that’s going to be our experience as a reader, which is going to be different from yours or anyone else’s,” Green said. “But we could also reassess our own experience reading it. Especially in those first three episodes where we were adapting parts of the book that are very great, tight story and offer a very strong point of view. We also knew we wanted to sow the seeds for the later orchard of other points of view and other tonal diversions.”

Whittle didn’t finish reading American Gods until filming for season one was complete, because Green and Fuller stopped him, eager to create a unique version of Shadow. “They straight-up said, ‘Stop reading the book because it’s affecting your performance, and that’s not the character we want for TV,’” he says. “You don’t want a man who thinks every week. Shadow was very blasé and quiet in the book, and that’s just not going to work for the adaption. We needed him to kind of fight, and more friction with Mr. Wednesday.”

But perhaps the most notable change to the story involves fleshing out Laura’s backstory and her own plot. (Per Schreiber, Laura and Mad Sweeney eventually get their own road trip. It was pitched to him as: “Bonnie And Clyde with a zombie and leprechaun.”) The fourth hour establishes her complicated persona, and Fuller considers it “perfect hybridization” of his and Green’s styles. For Green, it’s indicative of how their ideas can mesh seamlessly with the source material. “It’s fan fiction that works its way into the new author’s preferred text,” he says.

Indeed, to Gaiman the series is a collaborative effort between himself and the pair, who will call and email him with questions. He points out details from the original that he knows will be important to the sequel that he’s writing, and puts his foot down when he believes they have misconstrued a character’s intentions. (However, he found his biggest demand—that the diversity of the characters and the cast be kept intact—was a non-issue for both the showrunners and Starz.)

And the show may yet have some impact on what Gaiman produces in the future. “Were I ever to write Wednesday again, he would probably sound a lot more in my head like Ian McShane, because listening to Ian deliver those lines is like, ‘Oh, that is the best they could ever be delivered,’” he says. But will he share McShane’s penchant for emoji?",2017-04-28 02:41:42

Miranda, who Dwayne Johnson introduced as his “twin,” rapped an original prologue before Cravalho, 16, took over singing duties. Dancers — clad in blue attire — brought the film to life on stage, creating an oceanic look with scarves. Despite her vocal prowess, the performance had a hiccup as one of the ribbon twirlers hit Cravalho on the head with her prop. The newcomer — already a pro — barely flinched.

Auili'i Cravalho got hit in the head by a flag and kept going like a champ #Oscars pic.twitter.com/onS3dvCBfY — Variety (@Variety) February 27, 2017

Miranda, the mastermind behind “Hamilton” is competing for best original song — up against other Broadway composers, including Benj Pasek and John Paul, who wrote lyrics to Justin Hurwitz’s music for two of this year’s nominated songs, “City of Stars” and “Audition (The Fools Who Dream)” from “La La Land.” It’s also up against “The Empty Chair” from “Jim: The James Foley Story” and “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” from “Trolls.”

If Miranda takes home the best song award for “How Far I’ll Go,” he’ll earn the elusive EGOT — Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards — and join the even more select group of people who have also won a Pulitzer Prize.

“How Far I’ll Go,” is considered the “I Want” song, a tune typically sung by the main character in Disney animated musicals that describes their dissatisfaction with their current life, and their hopes for a new life in the near future. It’s akin to “Part of Your World” from “The Little Mermaid” and “Just Around the Riverbend” from “Pocahontas.” But “How Far I’ll Go” stretches those boundaries, as Moana sings in longing for personal growth, as a 16-year-old girl who wants to venture out and become better for her own world.",2017-04-27 12:13:00

While some companies resort to timing their promotional tweets to be sent out atcertain times throughout the work day, others take a more holistic approach, interacting with their customers as tweets roll in. Some companies are so sassy about it that their hilarious brand tweets make national news!

You might remember the humorous musings of the Wendy’s Twitter account a few months back, but it looks like mobile giant Samsung is looking to get in on the action.

While promoting their newly released Samsung Galaxy S8, the mobile powerhouse asked its users to submit their very first photos taken with their new phones.

Internet troll savEdward gave them a response that was a bit too personal for most people’s taste.

But rather than blowing off the troll’s NSFW response, Samsung instead decided to go for the jugular and hit the man right where it hurts using a single emoji.

And because the savage response could be seen by millions, it wasn’t long before other Twitter users joined the party.

Samsung’s response had many iPhone users preparing to switch over to that Android life.

Now that’s how you craft a masterful burn.

21,Pizza. It's literally right in the picture. ,http://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a52288/pizza-wedding-cake/,"When Jess Melara and Tony Sanchez were planning their wedding, which took place last December in Miami, they decided to skip the traditional white wedding cake and serve pizza instead.

""Tony and I love pizza and aren't huge fans of cake, so we surprised our guests with Pizza Cake (yes, I said pizza cake!),"" Melara told Wedding Chicks. ""It was saucy and delicious and what pizza dreams are made of.""

Here is their four-tier wedding ""cake"" in all of its cheesy glory:

If you're worried that they missed out on any wedding traditions like picking out a cute cake topper, cutting the first slice or feeding each other a bite, you'll see here from these photos captured by Todd Good Photography that it's possible to do all those fun things with a piece of pizza instead.

We also love how their caterer made the pies more wedding-worthy by adding edible flowers and basil leaves to the tiers. But our favorite detail? These fun boxes they used to serve slices to their guests.

Before any cake-lovers out their totally lose it over the fact that this couple served pizza instead of cake at their wedding (gasp!), you'll be happy to hear that their guests with sweet tooths weren't totally left out. They also hired a food truck to serve nine different flavors of gelato at their reception, and also handed out Cracker Jacks and funfetti cake as favors for everyone to take home.

Best. Wedding. Ever.

22,"The previous actor, Richard Harris, was homophobic. ",http://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/viral-sir-ian-mckellen-reveals-the-reason-he-turned-down-playing-dumbledore-20170404,"Sadly, we'll never have a quintessential answer to Who'd win in a fight between Gandalf and Dumbledore?""

Firstly, they're both from different worlds, meaning they'd never cross paths. Secondly, Dumbledore is dead and Gandalf sailed away to the Undying Lands. And thirdly, this is all completely fictional.

However, let's get it straight here: If we're talking Gandalf the Grey vs Dumbledore, we're probably looking at Dumbledore just coming out on top. However, if we're talking about Gandalf the White vs Dumbledore, old Albus would be down on his knees begging for mercy within seconds. He just wouldn't stand a chance.

Advert 10

As it turns out, the two wizards could have been the same person.

Following Richard Harris' death in 2002, the role for Dumbledore needed to be filled. By this point Sir Ian McKellen had already cemented himself as Gandalf the Grey in The Fellowship of the Ring, and was awaiting the character's return at the end of the year in The Two Towers.

You'd think that already playing one wizard in a mega film series would be enough of a reason to let Michael Gambon take the role in Harry Potter's world, but there was another, fairly emotional reason.

Speaking on the BBC's HARDtalk the 77-year-old revealed that he was called by the producers of Harry Potter and asked if he'd like a part in the film.

Advert 10

Sadly, he turned it down due to the fact that the deceased Harris, who brought the role to life, allegedly expressed homophobic views.

""When he died - he played Dumbledore, the wizard - I played the real wizard of course - but when they called me up and said would I be interested in being in the Harry Potter films, they didn't say what part,"" openly gay McKellen said on the show. ""I worked out what they were thinking and I couldn't. I couldn't take over the part from an actor who I'd known hadn't approved of me.""

Advert 10

McKellen came out a gay to the general public back in 1988 on a BBC Radio show, and has since been an activist for LGBT rights.

In a statement on his website, he said: ""I have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about - nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.""



The actor is the co-founder of Stonewall, a LGBT rights group, named after the Stonewall riots.

Earlier this year, McKellen and millions of other demonstrators took to the streets for the Women's March in both the USA and the UK.

He was pretty much the star of the show, rocking up to the London march with this amazing sign:

The Women's March in London was the longest I have been on. See the rest of my message attached. pic.twitter.com/q7QC4Jvg0S

- Ian McKellen (@IanMcKellen) January 22, 2017

The sign, which has his best pal Sir Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in his famous face-palm meme pose. Perfect.

Advert 10

Taking to his own Twitter, Sir Ian posted a photo of himself with the Picard placard and this message:

""The Women's March in London was the longest I have been on. Unlike most demonstrations it was not commandeered by any one group with its identical posters.

""The women and their allies had devised their own visual protests, hand-written and improvised at home, expressing their personal reaction to the new President, whose name in schoolyard English means 'to break wind' appropriately.

""The placard of Sir Patrick, by the way, was not my own - I found it at then end of the March in Trafalgar Square. But there were hundreds of others, including the other three here.

""President Breaking Wind has impacted us all; and personally. Some like him, think they can identify with him, believe him because they've seen him on television perhaps and think the billionaire and his billionaire team are truly their friends. The rest of us, including the majority of voters in the USA, see through the charade: after all, the schtick is not exactly subtle. But he's riled us, got under our skin, asking us angry and despairing that he should have got through to the final of his show and turned democracy into a TV/Twitter spectacular.

""What will happen? No doubt his believers will soon be disillusioned. The rest of us cannot let him reign unchallenged. The Marches today were a good beginning. Some who fear him say 'give the man a chance', OK - he's started by removing LGBTQ people, climate change and state funding of the arts from POTUS's website. He's had his chance.""",2017-04-26 11:50:00

",http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/25/marvel-studios-phase-4-untitled-film/,"If there is one thing that Marvel Cinematic Universe does well, it is planning. The huge franchise is well into its third phase right now, and Marvel Studios has features slated to release through 2019. In a few weeks, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will make is debut, and other release dates line the MCU up through May 2019. However, Marvel Studios has been holding onto three premiere dates for untitled projects for some time. And, today, news broke that one of them had been delayed.

Over on Twitter, Exhibitor Relations pushed for the rumormill to begin after one untitled Marvel film had its release date pushed from July 10, 2020 to August 7, 2020. The one-month delay is a not a long one, but it does let fans know Marvel Studios will be aiming for the film to have a late-summer, early-fall premiere.

For now, it is hard to tell which film could take the spot's place. There is always a chance that Marvel Studios may seek out an original series to debut in August 2020. After all, that date follows after Avengers 4, and Kevin Feige has stressed that the MCU will go in a very different direction after the ensemble flick.

Of course, there is also a definite chance that the release date is being set aside for a sequel. 2019 will see Captain Marvel, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, and Avengers 4 hit theaters. It may be that Marvel Studios wants to bring out Doctor Strange 2 or even Guardians of the Galaxy 3 at this time. The former franchise had its first film premiere last fall, so a August 2020 sequel release would give the film fours years to get done. That timeframe seems a bit long for Marvel Studios, so others have speculated the date will be reserved for the next Guardians of the Galaxy film.

The man standing behind that podium with $0 to his name on Jeopardy is named Kevin. The question that he was pondering so seriously was one we’ll let you try and answer now.

What is the name for this?

Perhaps we are the violent sort. Maybe the fact that we immediately knew the answer to this could be blamed on our love of violent movies and television shows and video games.

The correct answer, in case you haven’t figured it out, is hitman.

But that’s not the answer that Kevin gave to the question.

",http://www.techtimes.com/articles/192443/20170118/carpool-karaoke-did-james-corden-dare-to-reveal-the-worst-singer-ever-video.htm#pt0-712142,"In a recent raucous version of ""Spill Your Guts Or Fill Your Guts"" on CBS' The Late Late Show with James Corden, the talk show host proved that he wasn't afraid to name names when it comes to calling out bad behavior by celebrities. But how did Corden react when game partner Khloe Kardashian dared him to name the worst ""Carpool Karaoke"" guest ever?

The Late Late Show with James Corden Clips And Games

By now, almost everybody knows about the wildly popular ""Carpool Karaoke"" segments on James Corden's late night chat program The Late Late Show. The famous sing along car rides are among the most viewed videos on YouTube, with well over 1 billion views and counting for the 23 segments filmed thus far.

Last year's most viewed viral video of all was Corden's ride with singer Adele, and the show is soon set to become a separate series spinoff on Apple TV, with Corden still on board as a producer, but not as host.

While the ""Carpool Karaoke"" clips may be the most popular from Corden's show, there are a bunch of other regular rotating games and bits on The Late Late Show, one of which is the aptly titled ""Spill Your Guts Or Fill Your Guts."" In the segments, Corden competes against a celebrity guest, as one alternately dares the other to either answer a revealing question or eat a disgusting food.

Corden's Truth Or Dare

This time it was Kardashian sister Khloe in the hot seat. When challenged by Corden, Khloe admitted that her least favorite show on the E! network was Rob And Chyna, starring none other than her brother, but then chose to eat a fish eye rather than tell whether or not she believed ""OJ did it.""

When Khloe asked Corden who was the ""rudest celebrity"", Corden almost balked as he worried that the show might be trying to book the star for an appearance. However, when Kardashian pointed out that if the person was rude, Corden shouldn't even want him on the Late Late Show, Corden admitted it was Pierce Brosnan, who had pushed him at a concert.

Then it came time for the big reveal of another celebrity name when Khloe asked the million-dollar question: Who was the worst singer ever on ""Carpool Karaoke?"" Corden looked pained as he paused and considered whether he'd want to answer, ultimately deciding that it would be ""unfair"" to do so and instead electing to chow down on a chicken foot.

It was clear however, that Corden did have a name in mind, and our money is on Britney Spears, who herself characterized her appearance on ""Carpool Karaoke"" as ""awkward"" in a later interview, in which she called Corden ""the guy,"" confirming Corden's producing partner Ben Winston's suspicions that the ditzy dance diva hadn't even seen ""Carpool Karaoke"" before actually filming it.

27,Leonard never wears lenses in his glasses. ,https://www.yahoo.com/news/something-big-bang-theory-never-220622002.html,"There’s something in “The Big Bang Theory” we never noticed this ENTIRE time

This is going to blow your mind, because the one mad obvious thing you’ve never noticed on The Big Bang Theory has been right in front of our faces this whole time…or should we say in front of Leonard’s face. We take for granted that the characters on The Big Bang Theory are our fellow nerds, ’cause they mostly are, but we’re here to expose Dr. Leonard Hofstadter for the FRAUD that he is. As any person who truly wears glasses knows, it’s a burden to bear, even if they’re SUPER CUTE and in line with your #aesthetic, keeping glasses clean is a lifelong chore.

But not for Leonard — because his glasses aren’t real and don’t have lenses, ya’ll. Yeah, as glasses wearers, we feel betrayed, too.

Look deeeep into his eyes — and you’ll realize that it’s actually quite easy to do because his glasses have no lenses and you can see straight through.

Galecki told the Huffington Post, “We rehearsed the first episode for about a week and a half, and when we started to shoot, they said, ‘Well, you’re gonna take your glasses off, right?’ I said, ‘No, I want Leonard to wear glasses.’ They said, ‘Oh, we just thought you were wearing them as Johnny for rehearsal all week.”

He also said that they had to get rid of the lenses in his glasses for shooting purposes — when he looked up with his regular glasses, the lights caught the lenses and created a glare. WE GET IT, IT’S PRACTICAL.

“I quickly popped out the lenses and that’s the movie magic behind that,” Galecki stated.

And obviously Galecki has run into problems on set. It must be weird to wear glasses with no lenses and act like nothing is wrong. In fact, the actor told HuffPo that he’s accidentally poked through the frame and ended up scratching his eye (which, ouch). “That kind of killed the moment,” said Galecki. We bet!

Story continues

But we can’t help but feel a liiiiitle betrayed by one of our favorite nerds. We still love you, Leonard, but we’d love you better with real glasses. JUST sayin’.

29,"""I wouldn’t touch those, are you kidding me?” Kennedy said with a laugh. “Those will always remain his."" ",http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/04/24/star-wars-george-lucas-altered-versions-lucasfilm-kathleen-kennedy/,"When George Lucas sold his company and the Star Wars Universe to the Walt Disney Company, fans were rightly worried about how this major change would affect the stories they've loved and cherished for decades.

And despite the Extended Universe stories being swept under a different bubble, no one has much to worry about regarding any other major alterations to the original films, much like what Lucas himself did to the cuts over time.

Speaking with the Steele Wars podcast at Star Wars Celebration last week, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy spoke about the company's commitment to George Lucas' final cuts and that they would not alter the films in any way.

""I wouldn't touch those, are you kidding me?"" Kennedy said with a laugh. ""Those will always remain his.""

This could be taken one of two ways, considering that fans have been clamoring for the unaltered versions of the movies for quite some time. Does this possibly mean that Lucasfilm would be against releasing the original cuts of the film, and that the continuously-modified Special Editions will remain the only versions available?

UP NEXT: Episode IX To Undergo Its First Script Reading Soon

Disney's purchase inspired some hope in fans who have wanted a high definition release of the original cuts—without the CG dance scenes, the extra wompa shots, and the infamous altering of ""Han Shot First""—but there is a wrinkle in that plan due to the original deal with Fox and Lucasfilm.

Fox owns the distribution rights to Star Wars: A New Hope in perpetuity, and their distribution deal for the other episodic films will lapse around 2020 and revert to Disney. So anything done before them is in conjunction with Fox, and Disney probably isn't keen on splitting such a huge money pie with a competitor.

But Kennedy's words also indicate that George Lucas' vision is the only vision, even if it's at different times, and they'd be silly to ignore the demand for a rerelease of the original cuts.

Maybe we just shouldn't expect to see that until 2020 at the earliest.

A storm is coming for the ladies of Litchfield when Orange Is the New Black returns.

Netflix announced Wednesday a date for the highly anticipated return of Jenji Kohan’s prison dramedy. The fifth season of OITNB will premiere June 9.

Along with the release date, the streaming giant unveiled a 15-second teaser for the new season, providing a first glimpse at the collective mood of the orange-clad prisoners after season four’s game-changing tragedy and cliff-hanger finale.

The footage rotates from prisoner to prisoner as Alex (Laura Prepon), Piper (Taylor Schilling), Nicky (Natasha Lyonne), Flaca (Jackie Cruz), Taystee (Danielle Brooks), Lorna (Yael Stone), Cindy (Adrienne C. Moore), Maria (Jessica Pimentel), Red (Kate Mulgrew) and Gloria (Selenis Leyva) are shown running a post-Poussey Washington gamut of emotions, ranging from shock to fear and rage. The teaser ends where season four left off, with Daya (Dascha Polanco) holding the gun that will seemingly initiate a prison-wide riot.

Laverne Cox, though missing from the teaser, also joins the returning castmembers for season five.

After the provocative death of fan-favorite character Poussey (Samira Wiley) — who was accidentally suffocated by Bayley (Alan Aisenberg), a white guard, during a protest — her body was left on the floor for a day and her death was covered up, prompting a grieving Taystee to incite the inmates to riot. Enraged by the abuse at the hands of the new guards, Daya gets a hold of one of the guard’s guns and points it back at him, leaving viewers to wonder if she will pull the trigger and where the timely Netflix dramedy will ricochet come season five.

“It’s war,” Brooks told The Hollywood Reporter when asked about the effect Poussey’s tragic death will have on the upcoming season. “Taystee has nothing to lose, she’s lost everything that she cared so deeply about. It’s time to fight”

Brooks recently revealed the fifth season of 13 episodes will take place over the course of three days, breaking tradition from previous seasons. OITNB has kept the time span of each season vague so as to not specifically address how much time is left on characters’ sentences, and the condensed time span is likely a shift to address the intense fallout after the inmates’ devastating loss.

“It will be very detailed, very intense, and you better get ready,” Brooks added of the season. “Get your popcorn, your tissues.”

The cast of the award-winning series, produced by Lionsgate, recently picked up their third consecutive SAG Award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a comedy series. Ahead of the season-four premiere, OITNB was renewed through season seven, marking the longest commitment of any Netflix original series.",2017-04-24 11:34:00

Apple's digital assistant will surprise you with references to The Lego Batman Movie if you pretend she is the Batcomputer.

The gimmick works if you say ""Hey 'Puter"" or ""Hey Computer"" (gravely Will Arnett voice not required). When you do, Siri will respond with a handful of Batman-appropriate responses like, ""How can I help you, Lego Batman"" and ""Welcome home, sir. FYI, Robin is trying on costumes in the Batcave again. He's doing some pirouettes in Batryshnikov.""

Here's a look at some of the responses we got when we tried it out:

(Note that Siri only works hands-free when you say, ""hey, Siri,"" so you'll have to hold down the home button or tap the microphone after you've activated Siri.)

This isn't the first time Siri has gotten a timely pop culture-inspired update. Apple's assistant is a known fan of Game of Thrones, Back to the Future, Pokémon Go, and a whole bunch of other robot-themed sci-fi movies.

While the Lego Batman update may not be Siri's most memorable pop culture update (or even her best troll) it should be a fun surprise to fans of the movies.

And whatever you do, just don't ask Siri to be your Valentine.

34,It prevents their feet from swelling and forming blisters. ,https://brightside.me/wonder-curiosities/this-is-why-celebrities-wear-shoes-that-are-too-big-for-them-307860/,"Many of you have probably paid attention to the fact that some celebrities appear on the red carpet wearing shoes that are at least a size too big. Why? Is this a new fashion trend? Or is there more to it? We at Bright Side have decided to figure this out.

In fact, many Hollywood stars deliberately choose to grace the red carpet wearing heels that are too long or too wide for them. They just know a simple secret: by doing so, they will prevent their feet from swelling and forming blisters. After all, celebrities have to wear high heels for hours — sometimes all night. Obviously, their feet will swell.

To avoid foot pain, discomfort, and chronic foot issues later in life, celebrities choose to wear shoes that are at least a size too big for them. Moreover, large pumps or sandals won't rub, pinch, or squeeze because they don't put pressure on the most vulnerable areas of the feet.

To keep shoes that are too large from slipping off the feet at the worst possible moment, stylists just put silicone pads inside the pumps. This simple trick ensures that the shoe fits snugly but stays on the foot, does not restrict blood circulation, and stops feet from swelling.",2017-04-23 14:20:00
35,Photos can be uploaded quickly and used to track her. ,http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-03-01/this-is-the-reason-emma-watson-doesnt-take-photos-with-fans,"The 26-year-old actress has been explaining that she only occasionally agrees to pose for snaps because ""it's the difference between being able to have a life and not.""

As the star of Harry Potter and Beauty and the Beast, Emma Watson probably gets asked for more than your average share of celebrity selfies. But she rarely says yes...

“If someone takes a photograph of me and posts it, within two seconds they’ve created a marker of exactly where I am within 10 metres,” Watson explained to Entertainment Weekly. “They can see what I’m wearing and who I’m with. I just can’t give that tracking data.”

But she doesn't let fans walk away empty handed, instead offering to sign autographs or have conversations: ""I’ll say, ‘I will sit here and answer every single Harry Potter fandom question you have but I just can’t do a picture.'”

Watson credits the rise of social media for making it particularly difficult for her to lead a life away from the spotlight. ""People will say to me, ‘Have you spoken to Jodie Foster or Natalie Portman? They would have great advice for you on how to grow up in the limelight.'

“I’m not saying it was in any way easy on them, but with social media, it’s a whole new world. They’ve both said technology has changed the game.”

36,If he was put in a film with Deadpool. ,http://comicbook.com/2017/03/03/patrick-stewart-professor-xavier-deadpool-return/,"This weekend, the world will bid goodbye to two iconic members of the X-Men Cinematic Universe. Both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are bowing out of the series after more than a decade on-board. The stars will exit their respective roles as Wolverine and Professor Xavier when Logan hits theaters, and fans are mourning the end of an era. While Jackman had been open about his decision to leave, Stewart's admission had plenty stunned as the actor only confirmed the suspicion last month. However, there is one way the actor could return to his longstanding role.

It's simple; Just put him in a film with Deadpool.

Recently, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman took part in a fan-based interview with MTV. It was there the British actor was asked if he was done with Professor Xavier for good. Here's what Stewart had to say:

""I would have said yes, but the discussion just now about Deadpool makes me think, well, maybe there is a proper justification for the revival of Charles Xavier.""

This isn't the first time Stewart has pitched in support for Ryan Reynold's mouthy mercenary. Last month, the actor said he would love for Professor Xavier to meet Deadpool. ""I would love that. Just set it up,"" Stewart said, even going so far as to ask Jackman to pull enough strings to ensure the meet-up happened.

Hopefully, Professor Xavier won't try too hard to read Deadpool's mind. He may have to scrub his own clean after doing so.

Not long ago, Jackman also confessed he would be interested in playing Wolverine a bit longer under one condition. The actor said he would continue in the role if the grumpy mutant were somehow folded into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, given 20th Century Fox's frosty relationship with Marvel Studios, it does not look like the crossover is likely.

""In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces.""

Logan stars Hugh Jackman (Logan), Boyd Holbrook (Donald Pierce), Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier), Dafne Keen (Laura Kinney/X-23), Doris Morgado (Maria), Stephen Merchant (Caliban), Elizabeth Rodriguez (Gabriela), and Richard E. Grant (Dr. Zander Rice). James Mangold is directing and helped on the screenplay along with Scott Frank and Michael Green.

37,English Muffins from The Model Bakery. ,http://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Oprah-s-greatest-extravagance-is-from-Napa-and-11078894.php,"When someone with the wealth and popularity of Oprah Winfrey talks about her ""greatest extravagance,"" plenty of things come to mind.

A predilection for seriously expensive vacations, maybe? A love for flipping multi-million dollar homes, à la Ellen DeGeneres, perhaps?

While the talk show host certainly doesn't shy away from luxury trips and pricey real estate, instead Winfrey's greatest extravagance is... apparently available for purchase in St. Helena.

That extravagance? English muffins from The Model Bakery.

""My greatest extravagance is flying in English muffins from Napa Valley,"" Winfrey said in an interview with People Magazine. ""There's a specific English muffin made by these two women at this wonderful bakery in Napa Valley. I know it's not a good carbon footprint to fly in your English muffins but...""

RELATED: Oprah admits she was 'off balance' two years after ending talk show

Winfrey named the English muffins as part of her holiday ""Favorite Things"" list in 2016. In her description of the muffins, Winfrey wrote: ""I don't have to tell you all how much I love bread. These English muffins are my current carb of choice: crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and scrumptious all over—especially when slathered with the amazing Clif Family preserves that are included. Full disclosure: I took a few bags home from the shoot!""

Model Bakery owner Sarah Mitchell confirmed Winfrey's love for the English muffins, telling the Napa Valley Register last year that she had tried it while in wine country.

""Oprah had the chance to taste our English muffins while visiting the Napa Valley earlier this year, and really loved them,"" Mitchell said. ""We've been sending her special orders for a while and were thrilled when we learned that they would be featured as one of her favorite things for 2016.""

While it may seem strange to declare a baked good an ""extravagance,"" consider the fact that a dozen English muffins and a jar of preserves will set you back $40 on the bakery's online store. The muffins are made of a focaccia dough, all hand-shaped by the bakers, then cooked in skillets using clarified butter. In 2013, Model was noted as making about 1,000 English muffins a day, although we wouldn't be surprised if that number has since increased, due to the Oprah Effect.",2017-04-22 12:03:00
38,Vin Diesel. ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1647049/who-came-up-with-the-idea-of-family-in-the-fast-and-furious-movies-according-to-michelle-rodriguez,"While the idea of family in the Fast and Furious franchise has become something of a running joke in online forums, the fact of the matter is that it is impressive to see how this series has never shied away from that central theme. The last seven films have stayed loyal to that core message, and The Fate of the Furious (which debuts in theaters tomorrow) will seemingly double down on it as the franchise moves forward. So who came up with it? Who was the person who figured out that family would make these films pop? According to franchise star Michelle Rodriguez, it can all be traced back to Dominic Toretto himself -- Vin Diesel. Rodriguez said:

It's something that came out of Vin's mouth when he didn't like the line that was there, and I love how it caught wildfire. At the end of the day the movie is all about that. If you've got no heart to keep together all the blowing up and explosions, nobody really cares

So according to Michelle Rodriguez's recent interview with The Los Angeles Times, we can thank Vin Diesel for the heavy emphasis on family that has carried the Fast and Furious franchise through its good and bad times. Throughout all of the monumental changes that have taken place over the course of this series' existence, and above everything else that has transpired over the course of the last sixteen years, one little ad-lib by Diesel established the idea that anchored the Fast and Furious franchise. From 2001's The Fast and the Furious to Paul Walker's final moments on-screen at the end of Furious 7, that's what it has all been about.

We cannot even begin to stress the importance of family when it comes to the success of this film series. Plenty of other big budget blockbusters have attempted the same level of chaos and carnage accomplished by the Fast and Furious movies, and in all honesty, some franchises have outperformed this series in that regard. However, by keeping the series centered on a simple and (most importantly) universal theme like family, the Fast and Furious films have managed to cast an enormous audience net and maintain a sense of intimacy even when things get chaotic and insane during the car chases.

If you are a newcomer to the world of Fast and Furious movies, then you may not ultimately realize how often that topic gets brought up in conversation during these films. For a lesson in the finer points of family, check out a supercut of Fast and Furious ""family"" moments below to see for yourself:

Knight was with Tupac when he was killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996. Despite the incident happening over 20 years ago the mystery that surrounds his death, as well as a number of bizarre conspiracy theories, has kept people interested in the case.

However, Knight - who is standing trial for a different murder - has opened up about what he saw that evening. He claims that it was in fact he who was the intended target and that his ex-wife and the former Death Row Records security chief are behind the ordering of the shooting.

Thaddeus Culpepper, Knight's attorney, wrote in an affidavit that his client had known for 'many years that Reggie Wright Jr and his ex-wife, Sharitha, were behind the murder of Tupac and attempted murder of Knight'.

41,He killed all the main characters. ,http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/03/19/rogue-one-writer-cant-believe-what-disney-let-him-get-away-with/,"As the first spinoff film in the Star Wars Universe, Rogue One was expected to take some risks. But the film's writer couldn't believe just what Lucasfilm let the production get away with.

Speaking with our ComicBook.com's Patrick Cavanaugh, writer of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story's Gary Whitta said he always thought the cast of characters in the film would have to die by the movie's end.

""I never believed that they would let us kill off all the characters in the film,"" Whitta said. ""That was our original instinct. The very first meeting with Gareth I remember saying, 'I kind of feel like they all need to die, but there's no way Lucas ... There's no way Disney'll let us do that. We can't kill everybody. It's a Disney movie.' And yet, they were fully supportive of it, and it's actually one of the coolest things about the film.""

Rogue One chronicles the journey of a ragtag group of Rebels who band together in an effort of recovering the Death Star's plans, in which there's one crucial flaw to be exploited planted within by the superweapon's creator.

The crew ultimately sacrifices their own lives so that the plans can get into the hands of Princess Leia and her cohorts, leading directly into the first Star Wars film released 40 years ago.

UP NEXT: Why Fans Will Never See Its Opening Crawl

""It's one of the thing that I hear the most is that last 20 minutes when you've got all these characters are basically going to make the ultimate sacrifice,"" Whitta said. ""It's the biggest kind of emotional punch that I think the movie has. I'm so glad that they supported that decision.""

Whitta elaborated that there was an enormous pressure from day one—not from Lucasfilm or Disney, but from himself. He said that he and Gareth Evans were determined not to be responsible for being the ones who ""screwed up Star Wars.""

""It took us awhile to get to grips with what it really meant to do a standalone film, but then once we understood it, we realized that it's actually really liberating,"" Whitta said. ""These characters are kind of one and done characters. There was never going to be a Rogue Two. Rogue Two already exists. That's what the original Star Wars is, and those characters aren't in it apart from Leia and Vader, and so we knew that we, now didn't necessarily mean that we had to, but it meant we had the luxury to, you know, we had the full spectrum of options in terms of what the fate of these characters were.""

He added that their deaths wasn't in the first draft of the story because they didn't think Lucasfilm or Disney would allow it, possibly leaving main character Jyn Erso on the table to appear in a future film.

""We always felt that it was the right thing to do, that these characters make the ultimate sacrifice,"" Whitta said. ""It wasn't that way in my original script, but again, we never felt that we would get away with it. K-2 always died, but Jyn survived in the very first version of the movie that we developed, and then it was Gareth who kept pushing for it, saying, 'I feel like they need to die. They need to die.' Eventually he convinced [Disney and Lucasfilm].""

Ultimately, the film benefitted from having a sense of finality in the greater, ongoing Star Wars saga.

""We kind of went back to that original idea of these characters, you know, it was kind of okay that they died, because they completed the mission,"" Whitta said. ""They die so that the whole Star Wars franchise can live, basically.""

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story hits digital HD on March 24. The film will then be released on Blu-ray and DVD April 4.

",http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/18/marvel-unveils-first-look-at-brie-larson-as-captain-marvel/,"Marvel Studios invited select members of the press to tour their offices on the Disney lots in Burbank, California on Monday afternoon.

During the tour, several new looks at films and characters coming up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were unveiled, including Taika Waititi's portrayal of Korg in Thor: Ragnarok, but none were more exciting than the first female hero who will get her own film.

On display in one of Marvel Studios' offices was a trio of concept art photos showcasing Larson in costume as Captain Marvel.

The costume was pulled straight from the pages of Marvel Comics. The most notable difference is the downplaying of the yellow which grabs the eye of those looking at Carol Danver's constume. Instead, it is a much lighter yellow, which can appear to be white at a glance. Otherwise, the suit on the cover of Kelly Sue Deconnick's Captain Marvel #1 is a quite accurate representation of what fans can expect to see in live action.

Artist Andy Park did point out that the costume is still evolving and Larson has not yet tried on the design featured in the concept art images.

Beneath the pair of images which simply showed Larson in costume as Captain Marvel was a design of the character fighting a handful of mech-type enemies in city streets. The enemies had purple eyes, one pair of which were shooting lasers in the background, but Captain Marvel used only one hand to keep the immediate threat's attempted punch away from her -- and was making it look easy.

As for whether or not those images will be released online any time soon, it doesn't sound like it. Larson will make her debut as Captain Marvel in Avengers: Infinity War which is deep into production but Marvel Studios is looking to keep the focus on the four remaining films prior to the ensemble: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor: Ragnarok, and Black Panther.

Top Chef's Shirley Chung and Brooke Williamson Reveal What They Eat When They're at Home

The life of a Top Chef alum seems like it's a nonstop food-fest all day, every day—cooking and tasting the best of the best, traveling the world, and getting wined and dined everywhere you go. We can imagine all that excess takes its toll. So when Top Chef Season 14 winner Brooke Williamson eats at home, she tries to stay healthy.

""I don't eat a lot of dairy, I don't eat a lot of processed food,"" the Los Angeles-based chef said, explaining that she travels a lot—and when she travels, she indulges herself. ""So when I go home, I feel like that's my time to kind of collect myself and clean out,"" she explained.

In fact Brooke, who owns four restaurants in LA along with a store selling culinary goods, recently completed the trendy Whole30 diet and gave up drinking alcohol for a month. ""And I felt great! So I kind of wanted to continue it,"" she said, adding with an eye-roll: ""And then I came to New York.""

Top Chef Season 14 first runner-up Shirley Chung also likes to stay healthy when she's not traveling or working. ""I cook a lot of Italian and Chinese food at home, so it's always balanced with lots of vegetables, a little bit of protein, and some starch. Naturally, I don't eat a lot of dairy…and I love vegetables,"" she said.

Shirley is hard at work on her new restaurant, a casual spot called Steamers Co., which she plans to open in downtown LA. She's partnered up with her husband (who will be working the front of the house) to serve up simple, healthy bowls of steamed seafood.

Keeping it healthy at home, however, isn't always easy. Shirley said she tries to avoid carbs, but ""I cannot stay away from rice, noodles, or soy sauce,"" she declared. ""So there's no way I could do [Brooke's] Whole30.""

The Whole30 program bans ingredients like sugar, grains, dairy, and legumes—including all forms of soy. Meat, seafood, veggies, some fruit, and good fats are allowed.

The latest hand-me-down that the youngest Jenner sister has gotten her hands on is a killer pair of over-the-knee boots that originated in Khloe's extremely organized closet. Kylie shared the leopard-print stilettos on Instagram, captioning it, ""to have older sisters who love to share is a blessing,"" so we're guessing Khloe already knew this particular pair of statement shoes had gone missing. See? At least she's asking first.

Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Yes, Khloe (and to the rest of the family, for that matter...), we would love to also be invited to share any goodies you no longer feel like you need to keep around for yourself. And with your amazing new fashion line, we can see exactly why Kylie chose to raid your closet.

Bella Thorne Ditches Her Red Hair For Something Much More Dramatic

Bella Thorne is trying something different from her trademark fiery red hair. On Wednesday (December 28), she shared a video of herself with her tresses dyed a deep navy ombré — a pitch-black color that bleeds into midnight blue.

The Disney Channel alum revealed her new 'do on Snapchat, where she snapped every step of the dyeing process. This included her jamming out to Lil Aaron and Futuristic while waiting for the dye to set. She shares so much of her life with fans that it's no surprise she documented the whole experience on social media.

Before this, Thorne rocked neon red and yellow hair with her older sister, Dani. Then they both dyed the tips of their hair rainbow two weeks ago. Now Bella's gone blue (da ba dee da ba die).

Does this mean Dani will follow her baby sister's footsteps? She hasn't posted any blue hair pics yet, but judging from this Instagram tease, the answer might be yes.

Dancing With the Stars Close this dialog window Streaming Options

Latin Night of Dancing with the Stars featured several 10s, a wet Argentine Tango, and a spicy performance by Pitbull, Flo Rida and Lunch Money Lewi$ (who sported a waffle brooch). But not everyone left the ballroom Monday wanting to Salsa into the night.

After a blah blah Cha Cha, Amber Rose became the latest celebrity to leave the ABC show. Her ouster came after a particularly damaging rehearsal package, when she’s seen walking out on her partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy after she couldn’t learn the steps.

“It was such an amazing experience and people don’t know this about me, but I’m really shy in a lot of ways,” Rose told host Tom Bergeron after she was ousted. “I think that showed on the ballroom floor. I tried my best.”

It was obvious during the rehearsal package that the competition was weighing heavy on Rose, who walked out on Chmerkovskiy after he lost his cool and punched the mirror when she wasn’t following his direction.

“You just did everything super perfect, you are not going home. You are going from the beginning to the end,” he protested as she began to cry. “If you’re done, then we are not going to be ready. Amber, I’m not going to let you go. You have to do it for you, you have to do it for me.”

She bugged out, anyway.

The duo clearly rallied on Monday, but their Cha Cha — performed to “Bla Bla Bla Cha Cha Cha” by Petty Booka — only earned 28 out of a possible 40. So long, gal!

The night’s biggest highlight was a very moist Argentine Tango performed by Jana Kramer and Gleb Savchenko. Dancing to Selena Gomez’ “Hands to Myself,” the duo borrowed a page from Flashdance and performed half of the dance while soaked.

“Now that is chemistry!” exclaimed judge Julianne Hough. “You set the record for the hottest Argentine Tango.”

“Pulsating with lust!” added judge Bruno Tonioli. “Driven by unsatiable desire!”",2016-10-19 01:35:00

And Carl Lentz.

As the lead pastor at Hillsong Church in Manhattan, Lentz has become known as the “rockstar pastor,” counseling celebrities on matters of faith when he’s not leading his come-as-you-are congregation. Lentz began talking to Bieber after an introduction from a West Coast pastor, Judah Smith, and that’s when Lentz learned of Bieber’s interest in baptism.

“The choices he had made ― he got to a place where he was like, ‘I want to start fresh.’” Lentz says.

Lentz speaks with Oprah about Bieber’s baptism on this weekend’s “SuperSoul Sunday,” where he details the story from beginning to end. When Bieber and Lentz first discussed baptism, Lentz says he explained its intention as “an outward sign of what God’s doing inward.” This resonated strongly with the singer, who Lentz says was ready to commit himself to Jesus in a way that he hadn’t done before.

“He has had a relationship with Jesus, and his mom did a great job doing her best to plant the right seeds. But you can get to a point as a man where it goes from being your mama’s relationship ... to yours,” Lentz says.

However, with the paparazzi constantly following Bieber’s every move, finding the peace and privacy for a baptism was an ongoing challenge.

“We went to four different places,” Lentz says. “I finally called my buddy Tyson Chandler.”

Chandler, a professional basketball player living in New York at the time, received the phone call from Lentz around 3 a.m. “I’m like, ‘Yeah, I need to borrow your [rooftop] pool,’” Lentz says. “He’s like, ‘I can’t get into the pool, but come and use my bathtub.’”

Since he is over 7 feet tall, Chandler’s tub was specially made to accommodate a man of his stature and would be large enough to baptize Bieber, who stands at 5’9”. Despite it being the wee hours of the morning, Lentz describes the whole scene as relatively normal. “Kim Chandler, Tyson’s wife, had some food out,” Lentz says. “This is like regular stuff for our type of church.”

The baptism itself, he adds, was anything but “regular.”

“It was probably one of the most special things I’ve been a part of,” Lentz says.

In one of the biggest revelations from the books, J.K. Rowling writes that Lupin's werewolf condition is a metaphor for illnesses that carry a stigma.

In a section of Short Stories From Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies, J.K. Rowling details the life of Remus Lupin, from childhood until his untimely death at the hands of Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. Lupin — who Rowling calls ""one of her favourite characters in the entire Potter series"" — was, of course, a werewolf. And according to the author, his lycanthropy is a metaphor for illnesses that exist in the Muggle world.

""Lupin's condition of lycanthropy was a metaphor for those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS,"" Rowling writes. ""All kinds of superstitions seem to surround blood-borne conditions, probably due to taboos surrounding blood itself. The wizarding community is as prone to hysteria and prejudice as the Muggle one, and the character of Lupin gave me a chance to examine those attitudes.""

Remus Lupin alienated himself from the world because of his condition. He became a werewolf on his fifth birthday, as detailed in the short story about his life found in Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies, as well as on Pottermore. Remus's father, Lyall Lupin, encountered a werewolf, Fenrir Greyback, during his time working for the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. He knew Greyback to be a werewolf upon sight, but the other members of the Ministry did not believe him. They teased Lyall, who grew angry and described werewolves as ""soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death."" Greyback heard these comments, and when the Ministry released him from custody, he plotted his revenge again Lyall Lupin. The werewolf journeyed to the Lupin's house, opened Remus' window and attacked the boy. Because the Greyback bit him in his wolfish form during the full moon, Remus was infected.

Lyall greatly regretted what he had said about werewolves. His son was the same as always — he wasn't evil or soulless, but clever and kind and smart. Still, Lyall decided to keep his son's condition a secret. The family moved constantly, upending their lives each time someone caught wind of the situation. ""Remus was not allowed to play with other children, in case he let slip the truth of his condition,"" Rowling writes. ""In consequence, and in spite of his loving parents, he was a very lonely boy.""

His loneliness persisted, until one day a wizard named Albus Dumbledore arrived on his parents' doorstep and invited him to attend Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, he made true friends — James Potter and Sirius Black — who learned his secret and loved him unconditionally. After their death, he returned to his solitary ways, but he eventually found a home with his family, Tonks and Teddy.

In a separate section of the book, Rowling details the difficulties of living with lycanthropy. She doesn't discount the challenges of his condition, but she emphasizes that he lived an amazing life despite the difficulties— he had a wife, a son, wonderful friends, and a mission. We know, of course, how his story ends. Though his life was hard and much too short, he lived it brilliantly.

Mandy Moore has a tattoo of what on her foot?

The ""Candy"" singer revealed the story behind her not-so-sweet tattoo when she made an appearance on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers"" on Monday night.

""About ten years ago, I was on tour with my band...when you go city to city you're on a bus, but you get a day room [in a hotel],” Moore told Meyers. ""I was the only girl, so I had my own room to shower and all the guys in my band shared a room.""

And it appears the boys had only one rule when it came to shower etiquette: No masturbating.

“It became this big joke, because one of my band members was like, 'I don't want babies on my feet,'"" Moore explained. ""And so we created a song called ""Babies on My Feet"" that we sang on stage every night. No one had any idea what we were talking about.""

Indeed, there's video evidence of Moore performing the unusual ditty from back in the day (above), but the band decided to take the inside joke one (permanent) step further by getting tattoos referencing the funny phrase.

",http://nypost.com/2016/08/08/you-wont-believe-why-espn-said-they-hired-jordan-rodgers/,"Jordan Rodgers didn’t just win JoJo Fletcher’s heart on “The Bachelorette.” He got his dream job, too.

The former Vanderbilt quarterback is set to appear on the SEC Network as a college football analyst this season, and an ESPN executive says Rodgers earned the role on his talent alone.

“Our talent office had Jordan on their radar for some time. His name was in the initial group of names that we discussed when looking at people to bring to Charlotte [where the SEC Network is located] for auditions,” Senior V.P. Stephanie Druley told SI.com. “He played at Vanderbilt. He played quarterback. We had seen some interviews that he had done. So we reached out to him.”

Rodgers was unavailable for an audition at the time. Druley claims the network didn’t know what show he was shooting that kept him away, though ABC and ESPN are both owned by Disney. When Aaron Rodgers’ youngest brother finally had his audition, he blew Druley away.

“It was clear he had a real passion and a deep knowledge of college football. The audition was really good — rare that someone walks in off the street and does an audition that we would be willing to air,” she said.

After Rodgers emerged as a front-runner on “The Bachelorette,” ESPN made him an offer a few weeks into the season.

“I had a real concern with how he would be viewed by fans of the show and what it might mean for him down the line,” Druley said. “He accepted the offer the day I was in an airport and saw Us Weekly with him splashed across the cover. Thankfully, the article didn’t live up to the headline, nor did a lot of the other ones I read.”

Rodgers has battled rumors he joined “The Bachelorette” for camera time instead of finding love. Though he and Fletcher are still engaged, his on-screen nemesis, Chad Johnson, called out Rodgers for using fame to his advantage.

Rodgers talked about his professional endeavors during a conference call with reporters last week.

“I’ve been doing broadcasting for the past year — doing radio for ESPN and doing some TV stuff here and there — and I’ll be working with ESPN and SEC Network as a college football analyst,” Rodgers said. “That’s the conference I played in. That’s kind of my knowledge base.”",2016-08-31 12:20:00

",http://www.nasdaq.com/article/youll-never-guess-how-much-money-the-marvel-universe-has-grossed-cm670369,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe, or (MCU) is a shared fictional universe focused on a series of superhero films that are based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics. In addition to feature films, it also includes comic books, short films, and television series. Films in the MCU have been split into three distinct phases.

It was acquired back in 2009 by the Walt Disney Co. DIS for $4 billion. Many were worried that the deal would both ruin beloved Marvel characters like Iron Man and damage Disney's financial standing and stock valuation. Fast forward to 2016, and Disney's acquisition could very well be one of the best things to happen to both the media giant and the comic book publisher.

However, it looks like the MCU is quickly coming to an end, at least as we know it. In an interview with IGN , Anthony Russo-who will be directing the upcoming Avengers films with his brother Joe-said that ""these two movies are intended to be the culmination of everything that has happened in the MCU since the very first Iron Man movie…In being a culmination, these movies are in some ways going to be an end to certain things, and in some ways, they're going to be the beginning of certain things.""

With this in mind, how much money has Marvel grossed at the total worldwide box office? And how much more can it bring in? Let's break it down:

Phase One

Iron Man - $585,174,222

The Incredible Hulk - $263,427,551

Iron Man 2 , bringing in $623,933,331

Thor - $449,326,618

Captain America: The First Avenger - $370,569,774

The Avengers - $1,518,594,910

Phase Two

Iron Man 3 - $1,518,594,910

Thor: The Dark World - $644,783,140

Captain America: The Winter Soldier - $714,121,534

Guardians of the Galaxy - $774,176,600

Avengers: Age of Ultron - $1,398,858,115

Ant-Man - $518,585,201

Phase Three

Phase three is just in its beginning stage, but will wrap up by 2019. The first of the last 10 films of the MCU, Captain America: Civil War , brought in almost $1.5 billion worldwide during its theatrical release.

Audiences can look forward to Doctor Strange hitting theaters this fall; Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , Spider-Man: Homecoming , and Thor: Ragnarok debuting in 2017; Black Panther , Avengers: Infinity War , and Ant-Man and the Wasp premiering in 2018; and Captain Marvel and the untitled Avengers sequel coming to theaters in 2019.

The Marvel Effect

As of now, the MCU has grossed $10,527,843,932 at the box office, and if the next nine films can live up to each of their respective predecessors, the franchise could very well double, and even triple, its worldwide earnings. Both of the next Avengers films could easily make $1 billion each, and if the next Guardians , Thor , and Ant-Man movies follow in common sequel fashion, they could all make well over their originals' total earnings.

Predicting gross profit from films is difficult, as Hollywood accounting is notoriously complicated, but it is safe to argue that Marvel has proven to be the ultimate money maker. Its films, comics, TV shows, merchandise, and all other revenue sources show that Disney made the entertainment deal of a lifetime.

Click here for 12 new Disney World attractions opening in 2016.

Walt Disney first built the park in 1971 as a supplement to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which the animation legend had opened 16 years earlier, on July 17, 1955. However, Orlando wasn’t the initial location that Walt considered for his second park. Plans had actually been drawn up in 1963 for an indoor theme park that was to be built in downtown St. Louis.

At the time, it made a lot of sense. Research showed that only five percent of Disneyland’s guests traveled from east of the Mississippi River, despite the fact that 75 percent of America’s population lived on that side of the country — and Walt desperately wanted the extra business. When the plans were drawn up, St. Louis was booming, the landmark Gateway Arch in St. Louis was under construction (it debuted in 1965), and Busch Stadium (est. 1966) was being built just a few blocks away.

However, the would-be Missouri Disney World hit a few roadblocks. Anheuser-Busch beer baron August A. Busch Jr. (who ran much of the city) allegedly insisted that the theme park sell beer, which Walt refused to do in the name of a family-friendly environment. Additionally, Disney was only willing to pay for the rides and attractions, hoping St. Louis’ redevelopment corporation would pay for the building that was to house them. The corporation balked at the idea, and Disney officially scrapped his plans in 1965.

According to 13 pages of blueprints that went to auction late last year, the plans for the St. Louis park included rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad — all of which are now fixtures at the Florida park.

In a new video for her app, Kim K reveals what it actually takes to have brows that perfect, and let's just say that it's not easy. First of all, she works with legendary brow artist and longtime pal Anastasia Soare of Anastasia Beverly Hills, which only comes to show that Kim K takes her brows very seriously. To put it into perspective, this is the woman who invented the Brow Powder Duo. Yeaaaaaah, kinda a big deal!

""Getting my brows done is not only a major part of my makeup routine, but it's also like a little therapy session. Anastasia will come to my house pretty much whenever, put her light on her head and go to work,"" Kardashian says.

Soare starts off by shaping the brows, which includes waxing any excess hair, as well as trimming the hairs with baby scissors. Then, she preps them by applying some eye cream and foundation around them to define their shape. This is a trick we've also seen her little sis Kylie test out—successfully, at that.

Soare says that highlighting under your brows will give you an instant lift.

She fills in sparse brows with a pencil and finally applies brow gel to set them in place. See, we told you it's not easy, but Anastasia clearly knows what she's doing!

And now, let's all marvel at the results:

Yep, totally worth it.",2016-08-18 13:00:00
66,"Pennsylvania.
",http://mashable.com/2016/08/02/netflix-tax-pennsylvania/#XIZiIpltaqqj,"Watch out: The ""Netflix tax"" is coming.

At least in Pennsylvania. The state legislature there recently extended its 6 percent sales tax to digital downloads and subscription services like Netflix and Hulu.

Though it's called the Netflix tax, colloquially at least, the fee will also apply to streaming and downloads for music, e-books and apps. Digital versions of newspapers, magazines and the Bible, will be exempt.

Pennsylvania joins a select group of locations that have begun to put local taxes on digital services. Chicago already has a similar 9-percent tax, often called its ""cloud tax."" Digital goods are also taxable in Minnesota. Similar taxes have come up in Canada. Netflix even battled in Kentucky over telecommunications taxes there, a way some states have tried to tax digital services without imposing a sales tax.

The sales taxes, like the one in Pennsylvania, are applied when a customer uses a billing address in a city or state with an applicable sales tax.

So if you want to avoid the Netflix tax, borrow a billing address outside the state. At least until the Netflix tax comes for us all, that is.

When and how to tax consumers buying services and goods from internet companies has long been a difficult question to answer. Amazon avoided charging sales tax for years before starting to charge it in some locations. Amazon now collects sales tax in 28 states.

One bill to charge online sales take, the MarketPlace Fairness Act, has been debated for years and remains up for debate.",2016-08-17 13:30:00

After two-and-a-half-years of reshoots, rewrites, stopping, starting and earning the nickname ""The Shut Down"", Baz Luhrmann's new Netflix series will finally air this Friday.

However The Get Down wasn't exactly cheap to make.

According to The Daily Telegraph, Luhrmann's new project has broken records before airing, being tipped as the most-expensive series Netflix has ever produced after the budget exceeded $120 million

The director has a history was going over budget - and film schedules - with his 2012 retelling of The Great Gatsby going significantly over budget.

Similarly to the Gatsby, Luhrmann went through numerous script writers for The Get Down, and according to Variety, ""two showrunners and every inch of the patience among executives at Sony Pictures Television.""

Despite this, the show, that chronicles funk music in the Bronx during the 1970s, has already received some decent reviews.

Indewire have called it Luhrmann’s best work since Moulin Rouge while The Hollywood Reporter have said the series thrives when Luhrmann’s influence becomes less evident.

“(Luhrmann’s) excesses work best in specific environments (Moulin Rouge) and less effectively in others (Australia, The Great Gatsby),” they wrote.

Jaden Smith stars in the series, alongside Jimmy Smits, Shameik Moore and Justice Smith.

72,With Jimmy Kimmel drawing a picture of a penis. ,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/07/matt-damon-jimmy-kimmel-couples-therapy,"Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Matt Damon has a new movie coming out this weekend, which means that once more, he’s set to do press with his arch nemesis: ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel. Damon and Kimmel, of course, aren’t real enemies; their faux feud goes way back to the early days of Jimmy Kimmel Live, when Kimmel decided on the spur of the moment that it would be funny to pretend to bump Matt Damon from his lineup; years later, Damon mock-reamed out the host when appearing on Kimmel for the first time in 2006. Their pretend bad blood has been a running gag ever since. (There are plenty of timelines on the Internet that go into excruciating detail of every parry and thrust in that made-up feud; E! has a good crash course.)

A decade later—and a full seven years since the feud truly climaxed with Sarah Silverman's “I’m Fucking Matt Damon”—there’s evidence that even Damon and Kimmel may be growing weary of their elaborate mutual vendetta. For proof, just watch the video above from Monday’s edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live, which is more of a “Kimmel vs. Damon” greatest hits montage than it is a new entry in the canon. Even the premise isn’t original; it finds the movie star and the comedian going to couples therapy, a gag they first explored just nine months ago:

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

That older clip, co-starring Dr. Phil, has over 5.5 million views on YouTube—indicating that there’s life within this old joke yet. But the new sketch—an 8.5-minute pre-taped bit that unfolds in a steady deadpan, with long, laugh-free stretches where you can almost hear the audience squinting and wondering when the jokes are coming—shows that both injured parties may be ready to bury the phony hatchet. That’s especially true in the bit’s ending, in which Damon and Kimmel turn to art therapy to work through their feelings.

Damon draws a picture of Kimmel with a butt for a face; Kimmel, predictably, draws a penis. Unpredictably, the image is enough to make Damon crack up—breaking character in a way that’s pretty much unprecedented for these sketches. Before long, Kimmel joins in; only their fake therapist keeps his composure. Maybe this means both men have finally decided to give up the pretense of pretending to fight. And if that’s the case, they’ve had more than a good run. (Perhaps Kimmel could try fake feuding with Jeremy Renner next?)",2016-08-10 15:22:43
73,"Hank Azaria debunks the fan theory that Moe goes along with Bart's prank calls.

",http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_579f3671e4b0e2e15eb642e3,"""The Simpsons""

On the very first day of this year, Jan. 1, 2016, a new “Simpsons” fan theory emerged that quickly inspired a viral amount of yellow journalism.

As the theory goes, famously cranky bartender Moe Szyslak has actually known all along that Bart Simpson is the notorious prank-caller that’s been bothering his bar since the very first season of the show in 1990.

Advertisement

The Reddit user that proposed the theory, Senor_Schnarf, argued that Szyslak is simply a family friend of the Simpsons and goes along with Bart’s pranks given he’s a lonely man who enjoys making the kid happy.

The most compelling evidence is that Bart’s phone calls to the bar are typically in the same exact voice ― every time ― and follow a beyond obvious joke structure. Szyslak also always goes out of his way to make the joke land.

As an example, in the Season 1 episode “Some Enchanted Evening,” Bart calls Moe’s bar and asks, “Hello, is Al there? ... Al. Last name: Coholic.” In that call, Moe could simply ask if there’s a Mr. Coholic or an Al, but instead yells, “Phone call for Al. Al Coholic. Is there an Al Coholic here?”

The running joke of Bart pranking Moe is one of the show’s most iconic bits. If this theory is true, you would definitely need to go back and re-watch all 27 seasons with the correct interpretations of the two characters to get an accurate understanding of the show. That would take a long time!

Advertisement

So with the opportunity to interview Hank Azaria ―the voice actor behind Moe since Season 1 ― about his recent Emmy nomination for a guest-starring role in “Ray Donovan,” The Huffington Post had to also ask how he felt about the fan theory surrounding his character and Bart.

Well, Azaria doesn’t believe the theory.

""The Simpsons""

Azaria, who voices more characters on “The Simpsons” than any other actor, first reacted to the fan theory by laughing. Then he said, “Uhh, that’s absurd. I never heard that before.”

Not an auspicious start for the theory, but Azaria did do a minor backpedal and said, “Wait, now that I’m thinking about it, he did sort of take a shine to Maggie. And he has often sort of ... ”

Advertisement

Azaria then paused what little credence he was affording the theory and continued, “But no ... I think Moe kind of is what he is. He hates pretty much everyone and has no patience for children.”

The voice actor went on to explain that Moe “is not the brightest bulb in the box” and summed up by saying, “that’s really all the explanation you need,” before laughing again.

To get a final nail to the theory’s coffin, HuffPost pressed on whether Azaria was definitely saying Bart has successfully been tricking Moe this whole time like the show makes it seem on the surface.

“Oh, yeah, I would say for sure,” said Azaria. “That’s how I’ve been playing it.”

",https://www.yahoo.com/news/making-murderer-fans-found-more-143032253.html,"making-a-murderer-teresa-halbach-bone-fragments

Netflix

Just because you spent over 10 hours watching the true crime documentary Making A Murderer on Netflix, that doesn’t make you a hardcore fan. That designation is only truly deserved by the scores of obsessed people meticulously going over every transcript and photo from the Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey trials. Internet sleuthing gets a bad rap these days, but it’s hard not to be impressed by the dedication these people have when it comes to figuring out what really happened to murder victim Teresa Halbach.

The latest discovery from this group comes from an analysis of the bone fragments pulled from the fire pit prosecutors accuse Steven Avery of using to burn Halbach’s body. During his trial they claimed his backyard bonfire burned so hot it obliterated her remains, leaving nothing but tiny bone fragment remains without any DNA left. But when fans took a closer look at the ‘human’ fragments collected, one stood out. Property tag 7955 included a bone that is clearly the carpometacarpus of a bird.

making-a-murderer-bird-bone-fragment

Case File

That brings us back to claims from the defense that Avery’s burn pit was regularly used to dispose of deer, rodents, and fowl remains from hunting. How many of the bone fragments collected and attributed to Halbach were just burnt animal remains? It also makes us wonder how a fire could be so powerful it reduced Halbach’s body to small flakes, yet this bird wing bone remained largely intact?

As with many of the key pieces of evidence in the Making A Murderer case, there’s a lot of controversy surrounding the bones found in Steven Avery’s burn pit. A proper forensic grid was never set up, and material from the pit was simply shoveled into boxes and sifted through back at the labs. Record keeping and chain of command protocols were largely ignored by the forensic labs, and the defense in Steven Avery’s trial complained “It is unclear whether some, all, or none of the fragments had been previously determined by the state’s forensic anthropologist to be human or not. In short, the defense has no way of knowing from this cryptic report what was sent to and examined by the FBI Lab.”

Story continues

making-a-murderer-bone-box

Case File / Making A Murderer

Steven Avery’s guilt was largely assumed by the public once news reports said Teresa Halbach’s remains were found in his back yard. But that claim, made so persuasively by prosecutor Ken Kratz during Avery’s trial, wasn’t backed up by much science. IDing the remains as Halbach’s was extremely difficult. The best the forensic labs could do was with one bit of tissue that had enough mitochondrial DNA for a test. But that test is supposed to give readings on 16 points of DNA in order to be usable. The lab could only get results on 7. Yet instead of reporting that as ‘inconclusive’, forensic scientist Shelley Culhane claimed the chances the mitochondrial DNA came from anyone other than Halback was “one in a billion.” This statistic is simply wrong — Someone checked out a single small mitochondrial DNA database of 65,000 people and found 122 matches at 9 points.

So you’ve got a single fragment of bone that gave a test result with less than half the required matching points to prove Steven Avery burned Teresa Halbach’s body on his property. That’s not a lot of evidence. Forensics didn’t have much better luck in Stephen Avery’s garage, where prosecutors claim Steven Avery executed Halbach with a hunting rifle. Not a single hint of Halbach’s blood was recovered from that crime scene, although a bullet found there in March (the initial investigation searches were conducted in November) was tested by Culhane, who found Teresa Halbach’s DNA on it. Interestingly enough, the DNA on the bullet was in the form of nucleated cells and not blood, just more ammunition for those who think evidence was planted by investigators.

The rabbit hole goes much deeper on the bones and DNA results, just another aspect of the Making A Murderer case that gets pretty iffy upon closer inspection. That’s one of the reasons people find the show so compelling, and why so many think season two of the documentary will feature Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey being cleared of killing Teresa Halbach. Avery’s lawyer Kathleen Zellner is filing her appeal at the end of August, and it’s guaranteed to blow the lid off this and many other inconsistencies in the case. She’s even said she intends to prove who Halbach’s real killer was as well. We’ll keep you in the know on any further updates on the case.

Tabloids have been speculating for months now on the status of their marriage. The couple have been sending mixed signals to the press and public for almost as long, never providing any affirmative answer.

Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck celebrated their eleventh wedding anniversary this week and it’s been almost a year since they publicized their separation. The couple is still seen together with their children. Case and point, their family trip to London and Paris last month while Ben Affleck was filming Justice League.

Neither Ben nor Jen will confirm or deny the divorce allegations. Ben still calls Jennifer his “wife” as he did during an HBO interview with Bill Simmons last week. Despite his unusual appearance on Any Given Wednesday, Ben Affleck was very clear once more how supportive Jennifer Garner was of him while he rebuilt his career.

But as recent as three weeks ago, Jennifer Garner had plans on divorcing her husband. So does Ben’s HBO appearance mean he still hopes they can reconcile? Does he still believe he can get Jen to come around and change her mind and not finally file divorce papers?

According to an exclusive ET Online report, a source quotes that they are making it work. They also come right out and say that they don’t know if they will ever get a divorce: “They still have not officially filed paperwork for a divorce,” the source reiterates.

ET also noted since their split, the two have established a co-parenting routine with ben remaining close to Jen and the kids.

They’re still legally married, but separated. They both live on their property in Brentwood California. Another source told ET: “They’re in a good place and co-parenting the best they can.”

Confused? ET did it’s best to get to the bottom of this conundrum. Do Ben and Jen know what they’re intensions are? Do they share every relationship up and down with the press and let the tabloids write what they will? Or, do the pair have things worked out and simply tell the press what it wants to hear in order to keep their lives private and press distracted?

Radar Online has an interview with Jennifer’s father after the devastating floods that hit West Virginia. Her dad remains mum about the status of his daughter’s relationship, saying he’d leave it up to the couple to discuss their personal lives.

People Magazine has published two conflicting stories. One friend of Jennifer’s says: “nothing has changed” in the relationship: “They’re still all about putting the kids first.”

Yet another report states that Ben doesn’t want a divorce and Jen has denied to friends that they’ve reconciled. The friend also said that Jen doesn’t mind that the divorce hasn’t been finalized, but she still intends on going through with it.

And to pile on more confusion, the same friend said that Jen really enjoyed her time with Ben and their kids in Europe. She liked spending time with Ben again. And yet another source said: “They have a lot of admiration and respect for each other”

So which is it? Will they or won’t they divorce? Will Ben Affleck and Jen Garner continue to play this game with the press, teasing the tabloids while not really giving them an answer? Or is Jen dangling the reconciliation worm before ben and is ben the one who’s being jerked about?

Now, it appears that Cosby and his legal team feel they have nothing to lose and are asking his accuser, Andrea Constand, to refund the money he paid her in a 2005 settlement, arguing that she and her lawyers violated the terms by cooperating in the criminal investigation against him.

The announcement came on Friday when Cosby's lawyers argued that the confidential settlement should be voided because the terms required Constand to tell him she was going to talk to police.

The 78-year-old comedian thinks that all the money, the amount of which is undisclosed, should be refunded. The judge didn't immediately rule on whether or not the supposed breach-of-contract suit could go forward.

While this recent announcement will do nothing for Cosby's public image, that aspect of his life maybe too far gone.

",http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1529909/when-star-wars-will-finish-filming-according-to-mark-hamill,"There are few franchises that truly inspire heavy fandom the way that Star Wars does. Since A New Hope first flew into theaters, American culture has been absolutely enamored with the galaxy far, far away, and entire generations have united together to watch the space opera and all of the colorful characters which it contains. As such, each new addition to the Star Wars canon is a cultural event, with droves of loyal viewers heading to the movies and attempting (sometimes in vain) to avoid spoilers. And since The Force Awakens was released in December, fans have been eagerly anticipating the next chapter of the main story, the still untitled Episode VIII. Luckily, we just got a little more information regarding the status of the next entry into the galaxy from none other than Luke Skywalker himself.

Mark Hamill has been pretty chatty regarding Episode VIII, most likely because he's actually in this movie for more than two minutes and actually has lines. Hamill most recently took to twitter to reveal when the cast and crew will be wrapping production for the untitled entry into the main canon, and it's real soon. Check it out.

There you go, you scruffy looking nerf herders. Production wraps on the next entry into the saga that is Star Wars in less than a month. So hopefully we'll be able to see some footage or teasers sooner rather than later.

Production wrapping for Episode VIII so soon is seems both exciting and hopeful regarding the overall quality of the mysterious sequel. Since we are not expecting the movie to hit theaters for another year and a half, this gives the producers, editors, and visual effects coordinators plenty of time to really make the film outstanding. The Force Awakens was gorgeous and felt like a chapter from the original trilogy, so Episode VIII will presumably attempt to do the same.

Rather than having to rush to quickly produce a movie for this December, the standalone film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will be released this year. The spinoff will successfully continue the hype and excitement for Star Wars fans, while also allowing post-production for Episode VIII to occur properly. Additionally, Rogue One will allow fans of the original trilogy (aka everyone) to go back in time a bit, and be re-introduced to the original characters that made the property so exciting.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will fly into theaters on December 16h, 2016.",2016-07-03 17:33:01

Kendrick, who has Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates hitting theaters in a few weeks, may not know much about comics or super heroes but she does have on particular Marvel character in mind should she ever suit up.

""My brother sent me a Squirrel Girl comic because he thinks I should [play her],"" Kendrick tells Net-A-Porter. ""I don't know what Squirrel Girl does other than be half squirrel, but I could be half squirrel!""

Kendrick would probably be a great fit for the ambitious and spunky Doreen Green. Her first encounter with Iron Man, when Squirrel Girl tries to impress him and convince him to let her join his super hero escapades, would be a blast having Kendrick riffing with Robert Downey Jr..

The inspiration to play a hero does have a source for Kendrick: Ryan Reynolds. ""Ryan is one of the most authentic people I've worked with; I can't think of a person more deserving of a hit like [Deadpool],"" the actress explains. ""He worked for so many years to get that film made because it's a character that was inside of him.""

Deadpool was very much a labor of love for Reynolds who pushed to get the movie made for years on end. It wasn't until some test footage leaked and the Internet went wild in support of a Deadpool film that Reynolds got to bring the character many say he was born to play to life on the big screen.

Will the same be said of Kendrick and Squirrel Girl?

",http://time.com/4384498/artist-vincent-desiderio-kanye-west-famous-video-sleep/,"Kanye West’s controversial video for “Famous” has been making headlines for its nude depiction of celebrities like Taylor Swift, Rihanna, George W. Bush, Donald Trump, Amber Rose, and Ray J tangled up in bed together, in a bizarre but intriguing tableaux of his oft-dramatic relationships with other celebrities. See the NSFW comparison here.

However, West, the self-proclaimed “greatest artist of all time” pulled major visual inspiration from another artist — realist painter Vincent Desiderio, whose 2004 piece, “Sleep” debuted at New York’s Marlborough Gallery and was later completed in 2008.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan, Desiderio — who is also a visiting critic at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts — reveals that he was not only supportive of the rapper’s artistic vision, but that he was happy with the end result.

“It’s an extraordinary and bold and different move for Kanye West,” he said. “And what I would say is that it is the clearest indication of his overall intentions as a person utilizing the media and working within it. I was absolutely floored and incredibly flattered and incredibly happy to see the video, which I think is really beautiful.”

Desiderio also disclosed that he found a kindred creative spirit with West, whom he respects as an artist in his own right.

“I think he and I are on the same page and he knows that, I know that. We both acknowledge that we are one brain, two bodies. He’s quite a remarkable man, not withstanding all the nonsense that accompanies a man strapped to a rocket, who sometimes is either misquoted or is compelled into a position that can frustrate someone.

Think of how Andy Warhol was intentionally misconstrued because he put himself out there to be misconstrued. Think about how his whole life was a performance piece and then you understand why Kanye at one point said, ‘I’m Andy Warhol.’ The way we’re thinking about Kanye West and the way he’s portrayed, there’s an orchestration to it, but social media is so large right now that it spins wildly out of control. Fundamentally, he’s an artist and I have total respect for him.”

The pair paid homage to their first outing as a couple by replicating their Rhode Island beach jaunt on the beaches of Suffolk, with not just one long walk on the beach, but two during a whirlwind 24-hour trip to the U.K.

According to the Daily Mail, the singer flew Hiddleston out to the U.K. on her private jet, accompanied by five bodyguards, because a getaway with an entourage is nothing if not very romantic. The pair then fittingly rented a “Bond-inspired” Jaguar and visited Hiddleston’s old stomping grounds, taking time to stroll on the beach with Hiddleston’s mother and sister.

As with all outings since this blossoming relationship started, it was faithfully documented by the paparazzi at a very close proximity, which is a real boon since Taylor has adopted a charming English country style since linking up with Hiddleston.

Stay tuned for more beach dispatches from Team Hiddleswift; after all, a couple that walks beaches together will probably, maybe stay together.

Well, turns out, ""Becky"" took her good hair and ran straight out the building as soon as she saw Queen Bey coming.

According to Page Six, Rachel Roy hastily left the building as soon as rumors started circulating that the Carters were dropping in on the event unexpectedly — of course, it's not like Bey would RSVP — to avoid Bey's death stare.

Whispers of the Carters surprise arrival started as soon as the lights went down. One fashion writer tweeted, “Jay Z has just arrived... What could it mean?” Then Beyoncé’s daughter, Blue Ivy, and mom, Tina Knowles Lawson, showed up, making it clear that the Queen was on her way.

Roy, apparently, took that as her cue and dashed before Beyoncé entered the building. “She disappeared with her place card and never came back,” said a source. ""[It was] weird. I don’t know if it was because she’s ‘Becky,’ or what?” Another stunned source at the event said, “Rachel just came and left.”

While Rachel's official excuse is that she had to catch an early flight to LA to be with her kids, this latest display of bizarre behavior isn't doing anything to squash those Becky rumors.

We would say let this be a lesson to anyone who crosses Beyoncé, but that's already perfectly clear.

Star Wars: The Force Awakens hits DVD shelves in less than a month, which will undoubtedly prompt diehard fans to comb the film for mistakes and easter eggs they hadn’t noticed in theaters. But there’s one gripe that’s been eating away at fans for months: a random exchange and awkward snub involving Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey that takes place near the end of the film. (In other words, there are major spoilers ahead, so please proceed with caution if you’re one of the three or so people in the world who somehow hasn’t seen this movie.)

The scene in question comes just after Han Solo’s death at the hands of his own, weirdly emo spawn, Kylo Ren. The crew of resistance fighters return to Starkiller base with the bad news and with the injured Finn in tow, and Leia seems to sense what happened to her estranged husband. She looks to her friends for comfort, but for whatever reason, she brushes off Chewbacca and hugs Rey instead. This was weird because Leia’s known Rey for all of, like, two seconds, but mostly because Chewbacca was Han’s partner-in-crime, and a lifelong friend of both Han and Leia. So why would she snub him like that?

Director J.J. Abrams recently caught up with Slashfilm, where this very topic was discussed at length. And while Abrams admits it was a “mistake,” he chalks it up to an unfortunate matter of positioning and blocking.

“That was probably one of the mistakes I made in that,” Abrams said. “My thinking at the time was that Chewbacca, despite the pain he was feeling, was focused on trying to save Finn and getting him taken care of. So I tried to have Chewbacca go off with him and focus on Rey, and then have Rey find Leia and Leia find Rey. The idea being that both of them being strong with the Force and never having met, would know about each other -- that Leia would have been told about her beyond what we saw on-screen and Rey of course would have learned about Leia. And that reunion would be a meeting and a reunion all in one, and a sort of commiseration of their mutual loss.

Lucasfilm

“Had Chewbacca not been where he was,” Abrams continued, “You probably wouldn’t have thought of it. But because he was right there, passed by Leia, it felt almost like a slight, which was definitely not the intention.”

Some fans have taken Leia and Rey’s embrace as a hint at Rey’s lineage -- was Leia drawn to her because Rey’s part of the Skywalker bloodline as well? Whatever the case may be, we can only hope Leia and Chewbacca kiss and make up in Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: Episode VIII, which hits theaters on Dec. 17, 2017. Patience, friends.",2016-06-23 13:30:00

The actor has invested in everything from a garbage company to an Amazonian tea purveyor and the popular mattress startup Casper, as documented on Crunchbase. His latest move involves sinking some cash into Qloo, a startup that bills itself as a “cultural recommendations engine.”

So how does it work? Qloo says it has “mapped the taste genome” by combing through massive amounts of data. Then, it spits out answers to burning questions from brands and advertisers about the preferences of their target audiences when it comes to things like food, music and TV. For instance, as TechCrunch reports, Qloo can tell you the favorite music artists of fans of the Golden State Warriors vs. fans of the Cleveland Cavaliers. That’s no small thing: it helps advertisers ensure they’re marketing the right things to both groups, collectively or separately, based on what they do and don’t share. (For instance, Warriors fans like Drake and Cavs fans like Li’l Wayne, but both groups like pizza and SportsCenter.)

The Series A round, which DiCaprio participated in, raised $4.5 million for the company. DiCaprio certainly has eclectic taste in investments; only time will tell if this endeavor will reap the same kinds of rewards he’s been bringing in with his work on the big screen.

The whale speech makes a comeback in this weekend's sequel Finding Dory, and we actually learn how Dory learned the language, but the story about how Ellen learned the language is an even better one. She spent one vacation listening to whale sounds for an extended period of time, and the bizarre experience stuck with her.

The cast and crew of Pixar's Finding Dory were part of a talk at Google recently when one attendee asked Ellen Degeneres how she learned to speak whale. She also asked the question partially in whale, because this is Google and the company is full of nerds. Ellen then told a story about being on vacation in Hawaii and finding her rental house next to a woman who would spend her days doing fairly mad levels of yoga, all while listening to an album of whale sounds.

I didn't know you could buy that record, but there's a record that just is whale sounds. And I was listening to it...and it was just the weirdest thing I'd ever seen in my life

This experience gave Ellen Degeneres an intimate, if unwanted, familiarity with the sounds of whales, so when Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton asked Ellen if she would ""speak whale"" for the film, she knew exactly what to do. Stanton, for his part, thought Ellen would veto the idea without a second thought, but instead, she dove in.

It's not all fun and games, however. According to Ellen Degeneres, there are downsides to speaking whale.

It's not easy...if you have to do it a lot it's very, it's tough on your vocal chords. You have to kind of warm up.

There's actually quite a bit of whale spoken in Finding Dory as a major character in the film is Destiny, a whale shark. A whale shark is actually a shark, not a whale, but one should apparently not tell Destiny that.

112,To see how the crowd reacts. ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1524030/why-jeff-goldblum-plans-to-sneak-into-a-movie-theater-showing-independence-day-2,"Roland Emmerich makes movies that demand to be seen on the big screen. Not just a big screen. The biggest screen possible. From the monumental explosions of Independence Day (pun intended) to the planet-rattling chaos of 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow, Emmerich specializes in sequences that fill every inch of the screen with practical and digital madness. Which is exactly why Jeff Goldblum plans to see his latest collaboration with Emmerich -- Independence Day: Resurgence -- in a theater, with a paying crowd, to appreciate how they react to the insanity.

Late last year, I was lucky enough to travel to New Mexico and watch Emmerich at work on the set of Independence Day: Resurgence. It looked like a massive undertaking, and I peppered the cast with questions about the process of working on such an epic blockbuster. Jeff Goldblum, over the course of one of his answers, talked about the joy of seeing one of Emmerich's movies with a crowd, and told me the following reason why he plans to sneak in while the movie's playing and enjoy it with a public audience:

You've asked the right person... because I do like to watch movies. ... I'm thinking of several scenes. It's a spectacular... once again, you can imagine, there's much spectacle. I will tell you this. There's more spectacle than I have seen in any... I think it moves the ball, it raises the bar, whatever metaphor I'm stupidly trying to think of, ahead. So it's going to be something that, even though you think you have seen everything before, you'll go, 'I never... That's bigger, and more than I thought!' So some of that. And I'll enjoy that. And like the last one, it's got some heart, I believe. Roland Emmerich is a person of soulful wisdom and humanity. Once again, he's very interested and passionate about creating characters that, for him, tell a story of loveliness and love, of comradeship and some very touching and sweet and funny things. He's got a very keen sense of humor. So I'm hoping that those moments will be delightful in those ways. And I can imagine, you know, watching it with the audience!

If you can believe it, during that last bit of his answer, Jeff Goldblum actually pantomimed himself eating popcorn, surrounded by an audience as they enjoyed Independence Day: Resurgence together. This is only part of his incredible explanation of the joy of working with Roland Emmerich, so you really have to watch the above clip to get the Full Goldblum, as I now like to call it.

Roland Emmerich's Independence Day: Resurgence takes place 20 years after the original film. Humanity is using alien tech acquired from our original encounter with the intergalactic species to bolster our planet's defense systems. Only, the aliens are back... and they are better prepared. Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner reprise their original roles in the sequel, joining newcomers Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Joey King, Sela Ward, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Jessie T. Usher. The movie will be in theaters on June 24. And if you go on opening weekend, look around. You might be sitting next to a wide-eyed Jeff Goldblum. Tell him we said hello.",2016-06-16 16:10:00
113,Merlin the Magician (seriously). ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1523940/what-transformers-5-may-be-about,"At this point, there simply shouldn't be anything that surprises you when it comes to the plot for Transformers movies. They're about giant robots who turn into cars and planes, so it's not like incorporating Arthurian legend into the mix really makes the premise that much more bizarre, does it?

How the human characters, played by Mark Wahlberg, and a returning Josh Duhamel, will fit into all this is unclear. The fact that those details appear to be missing from this plot would appear to indicate that the rumors that the franchise would be moving toward focusing more on the robots and less on the people may be true. A number of previously appearing Transformers have also been announced for Transformers: The Last Knight, though, if you're actually capable of telling them all apart, you're a better man than I. The film is currently filming in Cuba.

While seeing a new Transformers movie is probably not something on your bucket list, the fifth entry in the franchise is on the way, so we'd better all just get used to the idea. Production is underway on Transformers: The Last Knight and we know something about which characters will be returning and a few of the robots in disguise who will be in play. Now, some details about the plot appear to have been revealed, and in true Michael Bay fashion, they are batshit insane. Apparently The Last Knight subtitle is some sort of reference to the King Arthur myth. No, seriously.

The Transformers films aren't exactly known for their cogent storytelling, but if the word on Transformers: The Last Knight is accurate, the series is about to achieve a new level of bonkers. According to JoBlo, the new film will open with Optimus Prime discovering the Transformers' home planet of Cybertron, but what he finds is a dead husk of a planet, which he, somehow, is responsible for destroying. The good news is that returning Cybertron to life is possible if Optimus can just obtain a MacGuffin, er artifact. If you just guessed that the artifact is located on earth, you win the grand prize. There's a bit more to it, however, as the artifact is related to Merlin the magician, who, it turns out, received his magic from an early Transformer, because of course he did.

If there's anything that actually makes any sense based on this plot, it's the casting of Anthony Hopkins. He seemed like an odd choice for a Transformers movie, and while that's still true, at least now we have an idea where he'll fit. If he's playing a human, he'll probably be Merlin himself, because you'd want a big name to take on a role like that. Either that or he'll simply be a Transformer with an English accent, because you know that's going to happen. Transformers: The Last Knight will be in theaters on June 23, 2017.",2016-06-16 14:00:01
114,"June Moon, aka Enchantress...maybe. ",http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Who-Main-Villain-Suicide-Squad-May-135487.html,"The next DCEU movie to hit theaters will mark one of the weirdest and boldest comic book adaptations ever committed to the silver screen. Suicide Squad hasn’t even premiered yet, and it’s already obvious that the film has taken every possible left turn to set itself apart from what we expect from this genre. David Ayer has a vision in mind, and from what we’ve seen, it seems delightfully fresh.

However, despite the fact that we’re beyond excited for the upcoming release of Suicide Squad, we seriously know nothing about the film’s actual villain. Sure, it will be undeniably awesome to see these characters coalesce on the silver screen for the first time, but the trailers and marketing materials have done very little to inform us of the overarching conflict. What looming threat arises that causes Amanda Waller to bring this group of psychos and killers together? We’ve gone through the details, and come up with five potential big bads that could take center stage once Suicide Squad hits theaters on August 5.

Enchantress

Based upon everything we’ve seen from the Suicide Squad marketing campaign thus far, it seems as though June Moone a.k.a Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) has the strongest chance of taking on the film’s villain role. She’s featured prominently in the film’s trailers – consistently looking quite sinister – and her magic-based powers seem to line up with our understanding that the Suicide Squad will fight magical forces not quite within the realm of science. However, in some many ways, June Moone and Enchantress are two completely separate entities, so it remains to be seen whether or not the titular Squad will have to take down both of them, or just the evil witch persona.

Joker

Recent reports from early screenings of Suicide Squad seem to point to the fact that Jared Leto’s Joker may have no more than 20 minutes of screen time in the final cut of the film. That being said, that doesn’t rule out the possibility that he’s the mastermind behind all of the destruction and carnage we see. It wouldn’t feel too surprising to learn that he’s pulling the strings and manipulating everyone from behind-the-scenes. It could be to lure out the Batman, win back Harley Quinn, or simply to cause chaos everywhere he goes. At this point, nothing from this character would surprise us.

Tattooed Man

Although the Tattooed Man’s presence in Suicide Squad has not been officially confirmed, many eagle-eyed comic book fans seem to have picked up on the notion that rapper Common will indeed portray the relatively obscure character. Typically known as a Green Lantern villain, the Tattooed Man has the ability to manifest constructs from tattoos inked into his skin. The official designation of Common’s character is ""Monster T,"" and a monster featured briefly in the film’s trailers seems to match up with this particular villain’s known abilities, so all eyes are on the Tattooed Man to potentially be the one to cause a major headache for the titular team of super villains.

Lex Luthor

Numerous unconfirmed rumors have persisted for quite some time that Jesse Eisenberg’s Lex Luthor would potentially pop up at some point during the events of Suicide Squad for a cameo. He’s currently rotting in a jail cell, and for Amanda Waller to have him transferred to Belle Reve would make a great deal of sense. For him to be the ultimate mastermind behind the events of the film would most certainly help the universe establish his conniving intelligence in a way that Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice simply failed to do. It would also help expand the reach of the DCEU, making an instant connection between Dawn of Justice and David Ayer's Suicide Squad.

Someone Else Entirely

Like I already said: Suicide Squad seems like one of the best-kept secrets in the entire superhero genre right now. All of the aforementioned characters seem poised to take on villainous roles in some form or another, but there could very well be another threat looming in the wings. Perhaps new facts of the DC lore will receive ample exploration with this one supervillain team-up. The film will reportedly take place in Midway City, so maybe the Thanagarians will show up and cause some trouble. At this point, we will just have to wait and see how it all pans out when Suicide Squad hits theaters on August 5.

115,"It MAY be called ""Weapon X."" ",http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Wolverine-3-May-Have-Title-It-Makes-Perfect-Sense-135527.html,"While the most recent chapter of the X-Men saga is barely behind us, the next chapter is already hotly anticipated. This is because we know that we’re getting ready for the final performance by Hugh Jackman in his iconic performance as Wolverine. Much has been rumored, but little is actually known, about what Wolverine 3 is all about, but now we can add one more rumor to the list. The newest rumor regards the film’s actual title, which will sound familiar to those who know Wolverine, even though the title apparently won’t include his name. The word is Wolverine 3 will be called Weapon X.

All of our rumors up to this point have implied that Wolverine 3 would take inspiration from Old Man Logan, a comic that sees the character much further along in life, not in the early Weapon X days. This makes the report from Gamezone seem odd, yet, their sources, which they make a point to insist are reliable, are claiming that Weapon X will be the film’s title. While this might not be the title many were expecting, it actually makes perfect sense. The Weapon X program was the experiment that turned Logan into Wolverine and what he went through there has been a key part of his character since the first X-Men movie. We fully expect that Wolverine 3 will be some sort of true finale for the character, and so that may very well mean finding some closure with the experiment that created him.

The first Wolverine standalone film X-Men Origins: Wolverine dealt specifically with the events of the Weapon X program, however, that film was viewed as one of the weak links in the X-Men franchise to date, and its events were essentially retconned out of existence following X-Men: Days of Future Past. The end of that film saw Logan end up in the hands of William Stryker once again, about to undergo the same experiment, so while we know the events still happened, at this point we expect they happened somewhat differently.

Naturally, calling Wolverine 3 Weapon X also forges a connection to the type of cameo that Hugh Jackman filmed for X-Men: Apocalypse. As that scene concluded, the feral Wolverine ran off into the night. Could this film build on that conclusion?

This shrouds the characters' past in some mystery once again, If the film is called Weapon X, but is also taking inspiration from Old Man Logan, perhaps the plan will be to fill in Wolverine’s new history via events that take place in the future, thus completing the character before we say goodbye to him. This connection could also act as the introduction for the character of X-23, the female Wolverine clone, whose character has been rumored to appear in the new film. Maybe the experiments are up and running once again and it falls on a former subject to shut them down?

What do you think of Weapon X as the title for the final Hugh Jackman Wolverine movie. Does it work? Does it need Wolverine’s name somewhere in the title? Weigh in below.",2016-06-16 10:40:01
116,"Disney wants a more happy ending like in the classics, and the reshoots will also tie into Episode 4 - A New Hope. ",https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-rogue-one-reshoots-ordered-studio-unhapp/1100-6440339/?ftag=GSS-05-10aaa0a,"Anticipation is high for the next Star Wars movie, the standalone film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which hits cinemas in December. The first trailer was released in April, but now it has been reported that the film might be in trouble and the studio is demanding reshoots.

According to Page Six, executives at Disney are unhappy with the first cut that director Gareth Edwards has delivered. The site's sources said: ""The execs at Disney are not happy with the movie, and Rogue One will have to go back into four weeks of expensive reshoots in July. Disney won't take a back seat, and is demanding changes, as the movie isn't testing well.""

Reshoots on big budget films are not uncommon, and Page Six quoted a source at Disney who defended this decision. ""The filmmaking team and the studio always anticipated additional shooting and second unit work to make the film the absolute best it can be, and the actors were aware there would be additional shooting,"" the source said. ""Coming off The Force Awakens, there's an incredibly high bar for this movie and we have a responsibility to the franchise and to the fans to deliver the best possible movie we can.""

Neither Disney or Edwards' representatives have commented officially on the story.

This isn't the first time that rumours have circulated about potential problems with Rogue One. In January it was reported that Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation writer/director Christopher McQuarrie had been hired by Disney to rewrite the script, and that he had ""saved"" the movie. McQuarrie has a reputation as one of the most in-demand script doctors in Hollywood, and his work on World War Z helped turned a troubled, overbudget movie into a hit.

A number of people involved with the production of Rogue One have spoken about the different approach that Edwards was bringing to the film. When the cast and crew were first announced last year, Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy described how the film ""goes into new territory, exploring the galactic struggle from a ground-war perspective.""

Last month, star Riz Ahmed told Movieweb: ""What Gareth is bringing to Rogue One is [an] incredible, organic, loose, kind of a raw feeling. He speaks about it in terms of a war movie. And he compares it to other war movies. We're doing something a little different to the other films. And hopefully people are ready for that.""

Rogue One is set before the original Star Wars, and focuses upon a group of mercenaries who are hired to capture the plans to the Death Star. The cast also includes Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Forest Whitaker, and Mads Mikkelsen. It hits cinemas on December 16, 2016.",2016-06-16 08:50:00
117,Cersei Lannister. ,http://mashable.com/2016/05/03/game-thrones-heir/?utm_cid=p-fb-traff#lHxBPJzBTRqW#tM_nynXzQuqL,"Update: This post, written after Game of Thrones Season 6, Episode 2, explains the legitimacy of certain events in Episode 10. We've added some brief notes based on the rest of the season, so don't proceed if you haven't seen it.

The body count in Westeros is really starting to pile up -- and the return of one resurrected Lord Commander doesn't begin to make a dent in the numbers.

In Season 6's first two episodes, three of the Seven Kingdoms' most powerful leaders have been usurped and unceremoniously tossed on the scrap heap: Roose Bolton (along with his wife and hours-old heir), Balon Greyjoy (last of the participants in the War of the Five Kings and the last of the leeches burned in the fire by Melisandre) and Prince Doran Martell of Dorne (that guy in the bathrobe and wheelchair).

But the most important death is the one that barely got any attention: the poisoning of Princess Myrcella Baratheon, sister to King Tommen and official heir to the Iron Throne. She was the last Baratheon in Westeros -- legally speaking, at least -- and her absence has the potential to create even more of a power vacuum in Tommen's already ineffectual reign.

Credit: GIPHY

If Tommen were to die without producing any offspring, there'd be no official heir apparent -- a fact that doesn't seem to have occurred yet to his mother Cersei or biological father Jaime. So far, apparently, neither has thought to do what any real-life monarchy would do in this situation: assure the world loudly and often of a secure succession.

Which would be an easy and indeed pleasant duty for them -- if they'd only hit the books to find out who the successor is.

(Note that this is not the case in the Song of Ice and Fire books on which the show is based. George R.R. Martin has kept Myrcella and Stannis alive thus far; he also didn't have Stannis's daughter and heir, Shireen Baratheon, burned at the stake. At this stage, the showrunners are far more murderous than the famous author.)

So who is next in line to the Iron Throne of Westeros on the show, presuming Tommen's death leads to a peaceful and legal transfer of power? The answer might surprise you. But buckle up, because we're going to need to do some serious time traveling through Westeros history.

Even in real life, royal lines of succession can be hard to grasp. First of all, it isn't simply about who is descended from whom. There are several hundred royals in Europe who have more right to sit on the throne of England than Queen Elizabeth II, for example, but they are barred by dint of being descended from the Stuarts, a line of ousted Catholic English kings.

Similarly, if the Baratheons died out, legally and politically speaking, you couldn't simply hand the Iron Throne back to Daenerys, daughter of the Targaryen king that King Robert Baratheon ousted. Once a new dynasty seizes a throne, there's no going back except by force. And Dany's chances of doing that are looking pretty slim at the moment.

Sorry Dany, Dragons don't count when it comes to the line of succession. Credit: HBO

So to find out who would replace Tommen, we have to go through a convoluted Baratheon family tree, find out who married whom, and end up in another House altogether.

But first, a side note: Yes, technically there is a son of Robert Baratheon still alive in the show. His name is Gendry, the only one of Robert's bastards to survive Cersei's massacre. But he is still a bastard, and to ascend to the throne he'd have to have the current king legitimize him.

That's hardly likely, of course, even though Gendry has Baratheon blood in him and Tommen (secretly, sort of) doesn't. The air in King's Landing is thick with irony.

Robert Baratheon

King Robert and his lethal drinking horn. Credit: HBO

The leader of Robert's Rebellion acquired the throne by force. He had three kids, officially and legally at least, with Queen Cersei. Joffrey and Myrcella are dead, leaving only Tommen -- and if the prophecy Cersei received from a witch is to be believed, the other blond-haired kid isn't long for this world either.



The Throne would then pass to Stannis Baratheon, if he weren't pushing up daisies near Winterfell, then his faithful daughter Shireen Baratheon, if she weren't in cinders, then his younger brother Renly Baratheon, if he weren't in an advanced state of decomposition post-shadow baby.

That exhausts this generation of Baratheons. And according to this unbelievably extensive Baratheon family tree, you have to go all the way back to Robert's great-great-great-great-grandfather to find anyone in his family who sired another line that survived.

A hundred and fifty years before Robert was even born, an aristocrat called Corwen Baratheon married a woman named Leyne and had six kids. One of them, Arion, was Robert's great-great-great grandfather. The next one down to have surviving kids was Elyanna, who married a Lord named Mathin. Lord Mathin Lannister.

Mathin fathered Jason, who fathered Demon, who fathered Gerold, who fathered Tytos Lannister. And who was Tytos' firstborn son?



Tywin Lannister

If you were still alive, you'd be here by now. Credit: HBO

Yep, that's right. The old puppet-string puller, Lannister Godfather and Hand of the King could have sat on the Iron Throne in his own right! That is, if he hadn't ended up looking down the business end of Tyrion's crossbow while sitting on the commode.

That being the case, however, his title of heir to the throne of Westeros passes to his firstborn son ...

Jaime Lannister

He's alive and intact! Well, apart from that right hand. Credit: HBO

There's a problem here, however -- Jaime is Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. That's a lifetime post, one you don't simply leave, even if it is to become King. Cersei may want him to rule, but we get the sense that Jaime's sense of honor wouldn't let him leave the Kingsguard even if the small council bent the rules for him.

Update: Jaime was removed from the Kingsguard by Tommen in order to help the Freys capture Riverrun. In theory, that should make him Tommen's heir -- which might explain why he didn't look too happy at Cersei's coronation.

So if Jamie is passed over for the post, what about Tywin's second-born son?

Tyrion Lannister

'King Tyrion, first of his name' has a ring to it. Credit: HBO

Though a peaceful transfer of power to the Imp would be one of the most delicious things we could ever witness in a future Game of Thrones, it's also less likely to happen than Jaime's ascendancy.

You may remember that small matter of Tyrion being convicted and sentenced to death for regicide. He's officially a traitor who lost his trial by combat thanks to an overly-cocky Red Viper.

Even if that somehow didn't legally bar him from the throne, even if his exile thousands of miles away were no impediment and even if he didn't have Mereen to rule over, Cersei would personally slit every throat in Westeros before she'd let her little brother wear the crown.

Besides, Tyrion has made friends with dragons now. What does he need with a dumb throne made of sharp swords?

So unless the Imp intends to steal those dragons from Daenerys and seize power with them himself, the title of heir to the throne of Westeros passes to ...

Cersei Lannister

No longer just Queen Mother. But at what cost? Credit: HBO

Yeah, you read that right. Tommen's rightful heir to the Iron Throne, the next ruler of the Seven Kingdoms if he doesn't get busy with Margaery, is his own mother -- via the most convoluted route of succession imaginable.

Did we just blow your mind?

It doesn't just make sense from a genealogical perspective. It would also be storytelling dynamite.

Picture it: Cersei, fearful of the prophecy and utterly torn apart by the deaths of all her children, is forced to take their place on the throne as she mourns. The ultimate underhanded player of the game of thrones would win it, ironically, by legal means. And the victory would taste like ashes in her mouth.

Perhaps the only sweet part about it for Cersei would be the ability to lord over Margaery again, presuming Margaery will be freed from the Sparrows' clutches at some point. That scene would be the exact opposite of one from Season 5, and would be worth it just to see Cersei swilling her giant wine goblet and destroying her rival with a devastating put-down.

Update: Now we know Cersei was able to remove the threat of Margaery as part of her attack on the Sept -- which may not have left time for a vengeful put-down, but was certainly effective.

Is any of this likely to pass? Not necessarily. The whole of Westeros is under threat from a winter nobody has prepared for, and from the once-in-a-thousand-years civilization-ending threat of the White Walkers. To the east, even if there is no invasion fleet any more, there be dragons enough to cause serious damage. And Dorne, post-coup, is likely to be in full-scale rebellion.

The Baratheon-Lannister dynasty's chances of retaining control of King's Landing in the face of all those enemies seems vanishingly slim. But if the show and the books have taught us anything thus far, it's that you never, ever count this family out.

Update: Turns out the ""Cersei becomes Queen"" scenario was more likely than we suspected. But now you know it was a legitimate ascension to the Iron Throne, and not a coup by the Queen Mother.

Jorah gonna want to read this, ""Game of Thrones"" fans.

With our favorite characters in jeopardy every week on ""GoT,"" we're always looking for any clue or indication of who's about to go next. And no one looks more in danger these days than Jorah Mormont.

In addition to his life-threatening greyscale, actor Iain Glen is now playing a media mogul, à la Richard Branson, on a new show called ""Cleverman."" So now we're really worried.

Does Glen's participation in ""Cleverman"" hint at Jorah's fate?

""I don't think you can draw that conclusion,"" Glen reassured The Huffington Post when addressing our concerns. (Thank the old gods and the new!)

The actor explained that, although it appears ""Game of Thrones"" has a long production process, it's really only shot for half of the year with two units working in tandem. Contrary to popular belief, Glen says new projects are not a good indicator of whether or not a character doesn't make it on the HBO series.

""They've always been amenable to actors doing other work around it. Your guess is as good as mine as to whether Ser Jorah survives into the future. They keep us painfully in the dark, so well just have to see,"" he said.

Even if this season could mark the end of Mormont, fans can take comfort in the fact that Glen's new show is a lot like ""Game of Thrones.""

""Cleverman"" is an Australian-New Zealand fantasy series about what happens when the world of mythology collides with our own. Like ""GoT,"" it explores class and politics, and there's even some monsters and heart-eating, too.

Yum, right?

Though ""Cleverman"" may not have the same budget as ""Thrones,"" Glen says a big similarity is that the show's supernatural aspects enhance the story rather than distract from it.

""I think in 'Cleverman,' there are these supernatural elements in it, but you never get to the point where they bounce you out of the story and say, 'Well, I don't really believe that situation,'"" he told HuffPost.

Glen enjoyed shooting and would be totally up for Season 2 if it happens, which is fine with us. If we don't have to worry about Jorah, then now our ""Cleverman"" watch begins.

UPDATE: ""Cleverman"" has been renewed for Season 2, according to Deadline. Production for six more episodes will begin later this year.",2016-06-16 04:45:00

",http://mentalfloss.com/article/81564/it-cost-10000-show-bea-arthurs-face-deadpool?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Partner&utm_campaign=DYK,"Small celebrity roles and cameos can deliver a major blow to a film's budget, even when the star is only on screen for a matter of seconds. In the DVD commentary for Deadpool, lead actor and producer Ryan Reynolds reveals that it cost the project about $10,000 (which dwarfs what some crew members make on big budget films) to have his character wear a tank top illustrated with actress Bea Arthur's face, Empire Magazine recently reported.

In the comic books, Deadpool is Arthur's self-proclaimed ""number one fan"" and likes to watch episodes of The Golden Girls. The writers even named the spaceship for the Deadpool Corps ""The Bea Arthur"" in her honor. So, it seemed natural for the actress to play a role in the film—at any cost. In the commentary track, Reynolds said that showing the tank top in the film was ""potentially cinema's most expensive Easter Egg ever,"" adding that ""as a producer, I had to approve that $10,000 … You can’t have a Deadpool movie without Bea Arthur.""

122,"Because she ""kind of"" likes her weapons. ",https://fraghero.com/megan-fox-wants-to-play-kitana-in-new-mortal-kombat-film-for-the-weirdest-reason/,"Megan Fox is a well known pop culture face. Not because she’s starred in her own comics or is part of a popular video game, but it’s because she’s played key roles in popular movies such as Transformers and Teenage Mutants Ninja Turtles.

She’s all set to return this summer as April O’Neil in the upcoming Turtles movie titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. However, Megan isn’t planning to rest and wants to further grow her fan following as she’s looking forward to playing more popular characters, and this time she wants to fill in the boots of a popular fighting game character.

She revealed during an interview with Cinepop when asked if she wanted to play any superhero in a movie, that although she has no idea about a superhero but she’s really keen to play the role of Kitana, the badass hottie from the Mortal Kombat series.

I’ve been getting this question a lot and I should think about it more because I keep drawing a blank. I don’t have a specific superhero that I think I should play. I’m sorry I don’t have a better answer for you I don’t know.

As you all know Kitana isn’t a hero in the series but plays the role of an antagonist. She’s a badass that shows no mercy to her enemies, and is the daughter of Sindel and Shao Khan (adopted).

I thought of Kitana from Mortal Kombat if they ever make that movie again. I’ve always loved her fans and the blades, um, but that’s the only one I could think of.

That’s it, she wants to play the role because, um, she kind of likes the blades. To each their own I guess, but I’ve seen better reasons given by celebs for reprising the roles of fictional pop culture icons in the past. Let’s just leave it at that.

There are whispers that a new Mortal Kombat movie is actually in development and might be helmed by James Wan, who’s directed Fast and Furious 7 among other films. The last Mortal Kombat movie released way back in 1997 and was titled Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.

The film met with a moderate reception and under performed since the original Mortal Kombat movie raked in more revenue at the box office, which is one of the reasons why the series has been in hibernation for so long.

Would you like Megan Fox to play the role of Kitana in the upcoming Mortal Kombat movie?",2016-06-15 21:02:00

124,Production staff doesn't communicate about it in written form. ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1523960/how-jurassic-world-2-is-keeping-its-secrets-according-to-bryce-dallas-howard,"After the massive success of Jurassic World last summer, its upcoming sequel -- temporarily known as Jurassic World 2 - is without question one of the most anticipated movies currently in development. Of course, that means that the project has to take serious considerations where detail leaks are concerned, and one star has revealed exactly how it's doing that. According to Bryce Dallas Howard, information about Jurassic World 2 is being kept hidden by basically not being communicated about in written form.

The actress recently took part in an early press day for her upcoming movie Pete's Dragon, and I had the pleasure of sitting down with her for an interview. After a long discussion about her work on the Disney movie (more on that in a bit), we concluded the chat talking about Jurassic World 2 and director J.A. Bayona taking the helm. Bryce Dallas Howard mentioned that she's been communicating with the filmmaker, and that she was actually going to be seeing Jurassic World director/producer Colin Trevorrow later that day, but also noted that it's weird talking about the sequel because of the restrictions on communication. She explained,

Whenever I have the chance to be around that group, that crew I like get information. [laughter] J.A.'s over in Europe right now, so I haven't seen him in person. I'm sure he wouldn't... because you know what, the emailing and texting, you can't go on record. You can't write anything down, commit to anything in writing. So, tonight I'll just be like, 'Can you verbally explain to me what's happening?' But we'll shoot it next year.

Studios and filmmakers are constantly looking for ways to prevent details about their upcoming projects leaking to the public, and one could see this being a very effective way. Sure, one can imagine that there's a risk of some material getting scrambled if stuff isn't being written down, but not putting anything in texts, emails or memos means that nobody is going to see material they aren't going to see (and at the most extreme level, it's safe from hackers).

Jurassic World 2 has been seriously in the works for a while now, with J.A. Bayona coming aboard about four months ago. As Bryce Dallas Howard mentioned, the plan is to start filming next year, with Universal Pictures having put a flag in a June 22, 2018 release date. Howard will reprise her role as Claire Dearing, and Chris Pratt will be back as Owen Grady, and while Colin Trevorrow told us that a big theme of the movie will be the proliferation of dinosaurs, not much is known beyond that.

We'll hopefully have more news for you about Jurassic World soon, but you can next see Bryce Dallas Howard in theaters in Pete's Dragon, which will be arriving in theaters on August 12th.",2016-06-15 14:57:00

What about the new American wizard school in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?

Ilvermorny is the name of the school and the four houses are: Horned Serpent, Wampus, Thunderbird, and Pukwudgie.

The Horned Serpent is a dragon-like serpent with long horns and teeth. They are said to be able to control the weather, particularly rain, lightning and thunder. They can shape-shift, turn invisible and perform hypnosis.

Wampus is a cat-like creature that is pretty much a very scary looking cougar.

Thunderbirds are legendary birds that can generate storms and thunder when they fly. A Pukwudgie is a 2-3 foot tall human like thing with exaggerated ears, fingers, and nose. They have smooth grey skin that glows sometimes. They can disappear and reappear, create fire, and transform into either a porcupine or a cougar.

There is still more to learn about these houses and Ilvermorny. We’ll find out more November 18, 2016 when Fantastic beasts charms its way into theaters.

We were first introduced to Annie Ilonzeh during her days on General Hospital. Today, you can catch her every week on Empire as she stars a persistent journalist, Harper Scott. The Nigerian-American actress who hails from Dallas, Texas is one of 5 girls in her family and notes that she grew up in a frugal home. “We didn’t have the luxury to get our nails done all of the time,” notes Ilonzeh. She’s a tomboy at heart with girl next-door appeal that prefers sweats to evening gowns, and has a serious knack for at-home nail art.

When she’s not on set, writing or living her best fit life at the gym, it’s likely that you’ll find her nestled in the comfort of her home jamming her favorite songs and doing her nails. “I was a manicurist in another life,” she states. “Being pampered is great, but sometimes I like to do those things myself because it’s a little therapeutic and gives me some downtime for myself—and I need that,” she states. Between readings and 14-hour set days, some down time is definitely needed. Ilonzeh’s go-to polish is anything nude, she admits to hoarding nude polish and finding it hard to resist buying a new shade (we hear you, girl!) The perfect finishing touch to her manicure? An accent nail—and we’re not just talking a basic polish change. Ilonzeh goes the distance and experiments with jeweled accents, caviar finishes and marbled art—yea, it’s serious! She’s a beauty minimalist after our own hearts!

For anyone who was a ""Friends"" devotee, it seemed apparent there was something lovably wrong with Lisa Kudrow's character, Phoebe Buffay.

The beautiful blonde never quite seemed all there in the hit NBC sitcom. She referenced having a strange past multiple times on the show, too.

Phoebe told other cast members at various points during the 10 seasons that her mother was a drug dealer, that she hung out with a group of friends behind a dumpster, and that she had been homeless.

One ""Friends"" fan took Phoebe's checkered past and turned it into a dark theory about how the series should have ended, and it has gone viral.

The fan, @strnks on Twitter, posted the theory a few days ago and it has gotten attention on publications like Time and Daily Mail. In @strnks' eyes, the show shouldn't have ended with Ross, Rachel, Monica, and the gang walking out of their apartment, leaving the keys on the counter.

It should have ended just with Phoebe sitting in the friends' favorite haunt, Central Perk, staring out the window. In this alternate ending, Phoebe would have been a meth head, creepily staring out the window at five people who are actually friends — Ross, Rachel, Joey, Chandler, and Monica — and daydreaming up the whole 10 seasons, mentally inserting herself into what she assumes their lives are like.

""All 10 seasons were merely her fevered imagination,"" @strnks writes, ""projecting herself into the lives of the others. All she ever wanted was... Friends.""

Apparently, the brains behind that McDonalds jingle, you know the one, I'm Lovin' It, is none other than rapper Pusha T.

Former record company exec Steve Stoute, who now heads up his own marketing business, recently chatted to New York-based radio station, Hot 97, and revealed the inside information.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBlD2N_AwgI

He said that it was one of the first projects his marketing firm, Translation, looked after.

According to Pitchfork, the information came about when Hot 97's Ebro Darden initially referred to the jingle as the work of Pharrell and Justin Timberlake.

Stoute wasn't long putting him right and apparently said: ""No you know who did that? Pusha T"".

So, JT sang but it was Pusha T who came up with the slogan and the jingle.

134,"JD in ""Thelma and Louise."" ",http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Famous-Role-George-Clooney-Hates-He-Lost-Brad-Pitt-135547.html,"Brad Pitt and George Clooney, quietly, have made a ton of great movies together. The real-life friends have collaborated on everything from Coen Brothers comedies to a trilogy of Ocean’s capers. But back in the day, the two reportedly went out for the same roles, with Pitt getting the better on Clooney for at least one specific role that haunts the one-time Batman to this day.

Decades ago – long before he played Tyler Durden or Benjamin Button – Brad Pitt was cast as the handsome thief J.D. in Ridley Scott’s Thelma & Louise. Naturally, Pitt’s looks and charisma helped earn him the part, but as it turns out, he edged future bestie George Clooney for the role. Geena Davis, who played Thelma in Sir Ridley’s classic, recalled that she learned this fact while sitting opposite Clooney on a flight. As she recalls:

At one point, he says to me, ‘I hate that Brad Pitt.’ And I say, ‘No you don’t. He’s your good friend, right?’ And he said, ‘Oh, I hate him because he got the part in Thelma & Louise.’ And I said, ‘Did you want that part?’ And he said, ‘Couldn’t you tell when I read with you?’

Only, according to Geena Davis, she had no recollection of reading with George Clooney for the part! She was so enamored with Brad Pitt – who, to be fair, looks like a god constructed from perfect clay – that she hardly noticed Clooney, and didn’t recall meeting him until that day on the airplane, years later. Davis tells the whole story on The Late Late Show With James Corden, and it’s really worth a listen:

Now, when Thelma & Louise would have been casting (in 1989 or ’90), George Clooney was a TV actor whose “greatest” cinematic credit was playing Matt Stevens in Return of the Killer Tomatoes. He’d appeared on The Facts of Life, and was starting to make a name for himself playing Roseanne Barr’s supervisor, Booker, on the sitcom Roseanne.

But he hadn’t yet become “George Clooney, International Superstar,"" and it probably cost him a significant role. Of course, both Clooney and Pitt ended up doing just fine. But could you imagine Clooney as J.D. in Thelma & Louise? Would the part have worked just as well without Pitt’s outlaw charms?

Clooney isn't the first actor to deeply regret passing on a role. And he won't be the last. But I don't think he regrets it nearly as much as these actors, who ALMOST played superheroes but, for reasons we may never understand, passed on the chance. Some of these still hurt!

Mel Gibson as Odin in the Thor movies? We're not sure that we can actually see that, but according to the Lethal Weapon actor, it almost happened. Gibson admitted this while promoting his latest movie at the Cannes Film Festival, and without even realizing it, he helped himself join an exclusive club of actors who had been offered prominent roles in superhero franchises, only to pass (for various reasons).",2016-06-11 10:46:00

We’re told Khloe made it clear to Lamar from the time he almost died last year … she was dropping the divorce because she wanted to help him get better. She vowed not to re-file until he was able to run his own life day-to-day, and she believes he’s at that point right now. (TMZ)

Some people love Iron Man, other people love Thor; Marvel legend Stan Lee is no different. Over the years, he has struck up a strong relationship with many people within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This begs one interesting question: which MCU actor has Stan Lee bonded with the most over the franchise's eight-year history?

Stan Lee recently made an appearance on Larry King Now, and he was able to quickly answer that question when the host raised the issue:

Chris. The fellow who plays Captain America, he was the Human Torch and then they made him Captain America and he’s the greatest guy, but I love them all.

So it seems that Chris Evans and Stan Lee have developed a bond unlike any other shared between members of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That being said, Stan Lee does sort of hint that Chris Evans has a bit of an advantage over other Marvel actors. As he portrayed the character Johnny Storm, a.k.a The Human Torch, in Fantastic Four, as well as Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, he has had the opportunity to meet Stan Lee prior to the very existence of the MCU.

Of course, being the nice guy that he is, Stan Lee doesn’t entirely play favorites. He makes sure to note that he loves all the actors who play his beloved heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he has managed to strike up strong bonds with all of them over the course of the last eight years. Still, let's not forget that Captain America was one of the first superheroes he ever worked on.

Chris Evans is an actor who has really grown into his role as the Marvel Cinematic Universe has worn on. He seemed like a decent fit when Captain America: The First Avenger hit theaters back in 2011, and with each successive film he has seemingly become more and more comfortable with the role of Steve Rogers. In fact, as time has worn on he has arguably become one of the pivotal faces of the MCU—even rivaling the iconography of Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark on numerous occasions. He plays the role of the Star-Spangled Avenger so well, it’s not hard to see why Stan Lee respects him so much.

Barone portrayed Carol in The One With The Sonogram At The End, when she famously turned up at Ross' (David Schwimmer) museum and announced she was pregnant with his child, having recently left him for a woman. We then saw her have her first sonogram with Ross and her lover Susan at her side, giving viewers a glimpse at what would turn out to be Ross' son Ben.

But that was all we saw of her.

When next we saw Carol, in The One Where Underdog Gets Away, she was not only bigger from being several months pregnant, but she was being played by a totally different actress (Jane Sibbett).

Barone left the show, presumably completely unaware how massive it would become, because the part apparently wasn't big enough.",2016-06-06 11:44:00

""Kylie had been bankrolling Tyga for well over a year and she's finding herself short on cash as a result,"" an insider said. What's even more pathetic is the rapper reportedly thought the insane amount of money was Kylie's way of saying ""I love you.""

145,Bob Ross' Beauty is Everywhere on June 1st. ,http://trib.al/wReXvgO,"The show we’ve all been waiting for has finally made it’s way to Netflix. It’s possibly the single most relaxing television show ever in existence, and we now have access to it whenever we want. Get excited, because Bob Ross is back.

In case you need a refresher, Bob Ross made a name for himself with his show The Joy of Painting, which aired on PBSfrom 1983 to 1994. Ross’s soft spoken voice and his incredible painting skills made for the most calming TV experience one could ever hope for in the ’80s and ’90s. Not to mention his trademark curly hair that made him instantly recognizable.

But just so everyone’s clear on what to expect — Netflix isn’t streaming The Joy of Painting, but rather Beauty Is Everywhere, a series that was filmed in 1991 a few years before Ross died of Lymphoma at age 52. The format is nearly identical to the original show, the only difference is, you probably haven’t seen any of these 25 episodes.

Netflix is promoting the show with the completely accurate tagline, “His teachings are eternal. His hair is immovable. He is Bob Ross.” false",2016-06-02 13:43:58

At 34 years old, Ivanka Trump has many titles: wife, mother of three, entrepreneur (she’s launched fashion, jewelry and lifestyle collections, as well as her growing initiative, Women Who Work), writer, and businesswoman. But how does she juggle it all and look so good doing it? Here, she gives us a little glimpse into her world.

NewBeauty: Being that you travel often, especially on the campaign trail, do you have any beauty hacks for busy women who are always on the go?

Ivanka Trump: It’s so important to stay hydrated while traveling. It’s an easy hack, but drinking lots of water really helps you to stay glowing and energized during long trips. When I can, I drink lemon with my water—it dresses it up a little bit!

IT: Take off your makeup before bed, no matter what!! As a teenager, my mother once woke me up in the middle of the night to insist I remove my makeup. She felt like it was terrible for the skin, and I tend to agree.

NB: What do you want to teach your daughter about beauty?

IT: It’s crucial to me to impart to Arabella that confidence, strength and grace are what really makes a woman beautiful. The makeup and skin care are fun, but it’s who you are as a person that matters the most.

NB: Do you have any post-pregnancy tips for women to bounce back so quickly like you did?

IT: I started thinking more about the nutritional value of food—rather than purely eating for pleasure—during my first pregnancy and have tried to maintain that thinking between my last two pregnancies. I may eat more now (I have even added breakfast, which I always used to skip), but in a healthier way. As far as an exercise routine, I love to run. My team at IvankaTrump.com and I ran a half-marathon last year and I’ve become addicted to the endorphin boost!

IT: One of the greatest perks for our Spa Suites guests at Trump National Doral are the in-room offerings, including a bath butler service for a lavishly prepared, unforgettable bath experience. All of the Spa Suites feature deep soaking tubs and women can mimic the experience in their own homes by taking some time out after a long day, drawing a warm bath with aromatherapy salts, lighting a few candles and enjoying a couple minutes of pure relaxation.

NB: Do you have a favorite spa treatment?

IT: As a working mother of three, it’s not often I get to enjoy a spa treatment, but when I do, I love a classic deep tissue massage. This is especially helpful right now, as my neck and back are always sore from carrying around my two toddlers and infant son.

Thankfully for Jay and Bey fans, it’s a good one. Word is the two have been working an entire album together. And it’s safe to say the speculation of problems in their marriage served as a good distraction to keep fans from finding out what was really going on between them. Interestingly enough, this now not so top secret album will touch on the rumors that have been making their rounds on the Internet.

A source confirmed the news with Page Six and said Sunday, “Jay and Beyonce were never going to do an interview to address all the questions that came up after Lemonade. It’s more their style to respond through music.”

Lemonade is Beyonce’s sixth studio album. She switched gears this time around and premiered it as a visual album on HBO April 23 (which fans got to enjoy for free). Jay Z’s appearance paired with Beyonce’s lyrics caused fans to think she was finally spilling the real details about trouble in their marriage. Let’s just say that in one line she urged him to go get “Becky with the good hair.”

Stars from celebrity stylist Rachel Roy to celebrity chef Rachael Ray were accused of being Becky along with Rita Ora.

Beyonce and Jay Z’s new album is said to be hitting Tidal sooner than later.",2016-05-31 16:01:00

At this point in the series, fans of both the show and the books know there’s one major character who hasn’t yet been introduced at all. Well, to be fair, there are lots of major characters who haven’t (and won’t) be introduced, this one is different. Her name is Lady Stoneheart and we already have met her. Sort of.

Lady Stoneheart is the resurrected corpse of everybody’s favorite Tully turned loving Stark, Catelyn. In the books, the brotherhood without banners takes the Lady’s corpse (Thank you, Red Wedding) and brings it back to life (and we know from Arya’s time with them that they totally have the capability to do it). Many fans of the books were surprised that the character hasn’t yet shown up in the series since she has a major hand in the fates of other characters.

There was some speculation that the show may just skip over the character altogether and find other ways of getting to the same fates. People also thought that maybe the showrunners didn’t want to show a major character’s resurrection because it would take away from the (year-long) speculation about Jon Snow’s death. But now that Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are both headed to Riverrun (where Lady Stoneheart, aka Catelyn Stark, happens to be from) to deal with her brother the Blackfish, all the dominos are finally in place for the character’s big reveal.

And, from what we know of Lady Stoneheart, she will definitely make an entrance (you know, if the show decides to bring her in).

This season has already been filled with tons of stories of resurrection, both literal and metaphorical. From Jon Snow’s most obvious return to the resurrection of Arya Stark (with her reclaiming Needle and seemingly giving up her quest to give up her identity and serve the Faceless God) to Daenerys’ return to her rightful place as Khaleesi, it would definitely fit with the season’s overall theme. And it’s likely no coincidence that another Stark we thought was dead just happened to pop up, resurrected and transformed, in the last episode.

Hopefully we can see this badass character make a memorable appearance. And, while they’re at it, maybe we can bring back Robb Stark just, you know, because? (*SWOONS AND CRIES FOREVER*)",2016-05-31 13:56:57
149,It's A Small World. ,https://shar.es/1dFVVu,"When the folks over at This Exists heard that Natalie Imbruglia’s 1997 smash hit “Torn” has been played on Australian radio over 75 times a day for over a decade, they were amazed. Then, they had a follow up question: What’s the most frequently played song in the world?

It isn’t “Torn” (though seriously, 75 times a day?), but the top ranking tunes might surprise you. “Yesterday” by The Beatles has been broadcast over 7 million times since it was released (OK, not surprising), but The Righteous Brothers actually have the Liverpool quartet beat. Their “You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling” has been played over 8 million times on radio and television since its release in 1964.

Still, the reigning champion runs circles around even that. Here's a hint: It belongs to a theme park ride and has been played 50 million times.

It should be noted that the metrics for this kind of ranking are tricky. For one, there’s now the internet, where people are doing a lot of their music listening these days. We see you, Psy.

151,"Newest theory, Poe is her brother. ",http://hellogiggles.com/theory-reys-possible-family-means-crazy-things-next-star-wars-movie/,"For all the lightsabers, X-Wings and Wookies, Star Wars has always been, at its heart, the ongoing story of the galaxy’s most dysfunctional family. Now, if one recently revealed fan theory turns out to be true, you can expect the familial drama to get even messier in Episode VIII.

According to Reddit user Beeslo, there’s a chance that scavenger turned (possible) Jedi, Rey, and the best pilot in the resistance, Poe Dameron, could be siblings. While finding false connections between characters is pretty common place in Star Wars fandom (remember when we were all convinced Emperor Snoke was actually Jar Jar Binks?), Beeslo actually has some not-totally-crazy evidence to back up their claim.

In the Star Wars universe comic Shattered Empire — a story that bridges the gap between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens — we’re introduced to Force Trees. These are trees that, as you can probably guess, are imbued with the living force. At the end of the four-part series, Luke Skywalker bestows a Force Tree on to a trusted friend, a pilot named Shara Bey. Shara plants the tree outside of her house, which she shares with her young son, Poe Dameron. That certainly helps explain what makes Poe such an insanely talented pilot — he was absorbing the Force every time he went to play in his family’s backyard!

poerey.jpg Credit: Lucas Film

From here Beeslo begins to theorize that maybe Poe wasn’t an only child, maybe his parents gave him a little sister. And if just hanging out around a Force Tree can give you Force powers, imagine how powerful a kid conceived near one would be. Honestly, this makes us feel a little bad for Poe. It’s never easy when your younger sibling turns out to be better than you at everything. Imagine how he’ll feel when he discovers his little sister, Rey, is an advanced level Force user while he’s never even wielded a lightsaber before.

Obviously the theory isn’t one hundred percent sound. For one thing, Rey and Poe don’t share any screen time in The Force Awakens. It’s hard to imagine that the filmmakers wouldn’t even hint at such a gigantic relationship. Then again, there were no real hints in A New Hope that Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader shared any kind of lineage. Maybe we’re just being kept in the dark for an Empire-sized reveal.",2016-05-27 12:33:52

Wednesday's episode of the popular puzzle game hosted by Pat Sajak featured two contestants, LaToya Williams and Danielle Gilseth, each amassing $24,000 in cash and prizes leading up to the bonus round.

A tie is exceedingly rare on ""Wheel of Fortune,"" where players compete to solve hangman-style word puzzles. In fact, the last time such a stand-off happened was more than 10 years ago, according to syndicator Sony Pictures Television.

The producers then offered the pair a tie-breaker round.

See 'Wheel of Fortune' blunders:



Williams won the tie-breaker, then proceeded to a bonus round where she solved the puzzle: ""POUR YOUR HEART OUT.""

""I feel great,"" Williams said after finishing the bonus round. ""I thought I was going to pass out.""

All told, she took home $125,000 in cash and prizes, including a trip to Costa Rica.

""Wheel of Fortune"" is the No. 1 syndicated game show and is renewed through at least 2018. The format was created by talk-show host Merv Griffin in 1975 and has run in syndication since 1983.

156,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever. ,http://www.ozy.com/acumen/whats-the-worst-movie-ever/65509#.V0YRe37ATGE.facebook,"Entertainment was pretty great in 2002. We had singer Jennifer Lopez, footballer David Beckham, pop girl group Las Ketchup, young Brad Pitt. But perhaps it ought to be remembered for a big flop, headlined by familiar blockbuster stars Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu. Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (2002) might be the worst movie ever made, according to critics.

100 percent of the experts on Rotten Tomatoes rated Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever as “rotten.”

That’s right: 115 out of 115 critics — let’s be honest, a pretty huge sample size — would take back the 90 minutes stolen from them, rating the film a green splat rather than a well-rounded tomato. Critics, when asked to rate it out of 10, gave it a measly 2.6, and general audiences gave it an even lower 2.2. “Sometimes it’s surprising how stupid moviemakers think we are,” John Wilson, founder of the Razzie Awards, which celebrates the worst movies every year, says. Representatives of Ballistic’s director, Wych Kaosayananda, did not respond to a request for comment.

Lucky for Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, it has some company in the zero-percent club. There’s Orgy of the Dead, Return to the Blue Lagoon and National Lampoon’s Gold Diggers. But these other movies have far fewer critics weighing in, so the criticism of Ballistic has more oomph … more than any of its explosions. Full reviews skewered it more specifically: for plot holes, trying unsuccessfully to be like The Matrix, incoherent writing, clichéd tropes and difficult-to-follow storytelling. “It was one bad surprise after another,” critic Nell Minow says, looking back. Personally, we couldn’t hold it together every time the intense background music started up in a fight scene.

Today we live in a kind of golden age for cult movies, where ironic love of cinematic failures from the past can bring people to late-night movie screenings and yield book deals years later to rehash the disastrous experience on set. Bad-movies aficionado Emer Prevost, who runs the YouTube channel “Reaction & Review,” says that Ballistic won’t cut it, though, as a cult movie. It takes a special kind of bad to also be entertaining. “I took the DVD down to a local shop the next day. They said they could give me 60 cents for it. I said, ‘Good. Take it,’” Prevost says.

Of course, Ballistic probably won’t get to keep its place in bad movie history forever. Every year, the Razzies choose new terrible movies. Look back through time and the epitome of worst movie has changed as consistently as Ballistic’s characters’ motivations. Tastes differ on what’s not just bad but horrendous: Some say The Room is the worst; others, Plan 9 From Outer Space. And in all fairness, not everyone despises it. Critic Michelle Alexandria says, “I don’t watch action films for story or even acting. A good action film only has to deliver on the action for me.” So maybe make that 115 out of 116 critics.

CEO Mike Hopkins hasn't said yet which networks and shows will be available when the new programming starts, but we're crossing our fingers that the major broadcast (Fox, NBC, ABC) and cable (TBS, Bravo, Showtime) networks will join in. Hulu also announced that, like Amazon and Netflix, it's expanding its movie library. It has signed a deal for exclusive rights to a Beatles documentary from Ron Howard, which will be the first of many new documentary movies to be available on the platform. And for those who miss Dr. Mindy Lahiri, the fifth season of The Mindy Project will also be returning to Hulu.

""I was adamant,"" she added, but said the run-in ultimately didn't pan out. ""He knew I was looking for him,"" she told Norton.

The star hasn't kept her distaste for Trump a secret.

“If Donald Trump becomes president, that will be the end of the world,” Lawrence told Entertainment Weekly in October 2015.

The actress added that Trump's straight talking persona was especially disconcerting to her.

“I was watching him on the campaign trail and one guy said, ‘I love Donald Trump because he’s saying everything I’m thinking and I just can’t say it because of the PC factor.’"" she added. ""And I’m thinking, ‘You are absolutely right. That’s who I want representing my country, somebody politically incorrect. That will just be perfect,’”

Women who have spoken up against Trump experienced major backlash.

As ATTN: has previously reported, after feminist artist Ilma Gore depicted Trump with a micropenis, a supporter of the presumptive GOP nominee allegedly physically attacked her near her home in Los Angeles.

In January, Fox host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly faced a barrage of sexist slurs from Trump supporters after he demanded she be replaced by another moderator during future GOP debates.

After former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields alleged that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski forcefully moved her out of the way while she was trying to ask the candidate a question after a March press conference, Fields suffered a barrage of abuse from Trump supporters on social media.

Conservative news outlet the Blaze also obtained audio of an individual allegedly making death threats to Fields.

While a few choice Trump supporters have slammed Lawrence on social media, whether the actress will endure the massive online attacks reported by Fields and others remains to be seen.

162,The producers said a female toy wouldn't sell as well. ,http://trib.al/NGrNtGd,"Once upon a time, Iron Man 3 was going to have a female villain, a true first for the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a few reasons. One, simply being, FEMALE VILLAIN! Two, a female character would have been front and center with plenty of screen time. Unfortunately, this story doesn’t have a happy ending whatsoever, because that female villain never made it into the final version of the movie. Why? Because no one wants to buy a female villain toy, duh.

In a new interview with Uproxx, Iron Man 3 director Shane Black explains that many of the females in the movie had their plots drastically reduced before the movie ever began filming. When discussing Rebecca Hall’s character of Maya — a botanist who has a flight with Tony Stark and then ten years later ends up working for the bad guy — Black explains that in a very early draft of the film SHE was actually the villain behind everything. Until it came time to talk tie-in toys for the movie.

“We had finished the script and we were given a no-holds-barred memo saying [a female villain] cannot stand…because, after consulting, we’ve decided that toy won’t sell as well if it’s a female,” Black states. “So, we had to change the entire script because of toy making.”

WOW. Wow wow wow. If you’ve seen Iron Man 3, you know that Hall’s Maya starts off really strong at the beginning of the movie, and slowly fades into the background. The end of her story is [spoilers, for 2013’s Iron Man 3, but come on] she’s killed by the real villain, The Mandrin. But she was supposed to be The Mandrin.

“[Marvel] called and said, ‘[With a female villain] that’s money out of our bank,'” Black continues. “In the earlier draft, the woman was essentially [Guy Pierce’s] Killian – and they didn’t want a female Killian, they wanted a male Killian…they just said, ‘no way.'”

Black makes it clear that it wasn’t Marvel who got rid of the idea of a female villain, but rather the company behind the toys for Iron Man 3. They believed they wouldn’t sell, and told Marvel they’d lose out on all sorts of $$$, and well, you can see where this is going.",2016-05-16 19:00:47

164,“My Way” by Frank Sinatra. ,https://shar.es/1dXxRj,"We’ve all gotten talked into doing karaoke at some point or another, or maybe it’s one of your secret passions (I’m not judging). Whatever circumstance leads you to the stage on karaoke night, here’s a tip: Avoid “My Way” by Frank Sinatra. It doesn’t matter if it’s Rat Pack night. It doesn’t matter if you happened to wear your best fedora. It doesn’t even matter if you could be a voice double for Ol’ Blue Eyes himself. If you value your life, do not allow yourself to be seduced by “My Way” when you see it in the selection book—it’s literally a killer.

In 2007, a man was performing the song in San Mateo in the Philippines when a security guard loudly informed the singer that he was off-key. When man continued to croon, the guard pulled out a .38 caliber pistol and shot the performer in the chest, killing him.

Freak occurrence? Nope. Since 2000, at least half a dozen people have been murdered after (or while) performing the Sinatra classic. Dubbed the “‘My Way’ Killings,” the strange phenomenon has gotten so bad that some bar owners have removed it from the selection list entirely.

Theories abound as to why this particular song seems to evoke such violence. It could be that the song is just so Sinatra that anyone else who sings it is bound to pale in comparison. It could be, according to singing school owner Butch Albarracin, that the lyrics inspire “pride and arrogance in the singer, as if you’re somebody when you’re really nobody.” Pop culture expert Roland Tolentino believes it’s all about location—these killings have all occurred in the Philippines. “The Philippines is a very violent society, so karaoke only triggers what already exists here when certain social rules are broken,” he said.

While the “My Way” Killings do seem to be limited to a certain locale, karaoke rage seems to happen all over the world. My advice: The next time you find yourself with a microphone and a screen of lyrics in front of your face, opt for something—anything—other than Sinatra.",2016-05-14 23:20:46

Have you ever clicked on an exciting link or potentially explosive news story, only to find yourself watching the 1987 Rick Astley hit 'Never Gonna Give You Up'? Then you’ve been rickrolled, my friend.

A classic bait-and-switch scenario, the meme is as popular now as it’s ever been.

“I think it’s just one of those odd things where something gets picked up and people run with it,” the eponymous singer told the L.A. Times in 2008. “But that’s what's brilliant about the Internet.”

He originally rose to fame in the 1980s, scoring number one singles in the UK, a platinum-selling album, and even a Grammy nomination. But after millions upon millions of views, how much money has the rickrolling prank raked in for its star?

Well, as of 2010, he has received the princely sum of…$12.

This is because Astley didn’t write the song, so he only receives a performer’s share of the sound recording copyright.

Astley doesn’t seem to have any hard feelings about rickrolling.

“Listen, I just think it’s bizarre and funny. My main consideration is that my daughter doesn’t get embarrassed about it.”

And despite the prevalence of the meme, he has no plans to remix or re-release the song to cash in on the phenomenon.

“I don’t really know whether I want to be doing that,” he said. “I’m not being an ageist, but it’s almost a young person’s thing, that. I think the artist themselves trying to remix it is almost a bit sad. No, I’m too old for that.”

167,No. ,http://nerdist.com/does-sean-bean-really-die-more-than-other-actors/,"One does not simply… assume.

Actor Sean Bean has been dying over and over again for 20 years. He’s been dropped from a satellite dish in Goldeneye, shot through the neck with a grappling hook in The Island, peppered with arrows in The Lord of the Rings, and decapitated in Game of Thrones. But with the number of Sean Bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show Legends, maybe it’s time to put the many demises into perspective.

Start looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times. A long enough career can rack up the kills. For example, Robert de Niro has died on screen 19 times. Other stars like Leonardo DiCaprio have died 9 times. So where does Sean Bean fall along this list?

I crafted the following chart to find out:

Click to enlarge!*

It looks like the “walking spoiler” meme has a grain of truth to it. While Bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them — almost a third of his films.

However, even though Bean has perfected his “I’m dying” face, he still hasn’t died the most on screen. Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies.

But the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt. With over 120 movies, Hurt’s death percentage is similar to Bean’s — around 30% — but just seeing the list of Hurt’s 43* deaths is impressive.

He has died in The Wild and the Willing, Sinful Davey, A Man for All Seasons, 10 Rillington Place, The Ghoul East of Elephant Rock, Spectre, Alien, The Elephant Man, Heaven’s Gate, The Osterman Weekend, The Hit, After Darkness, The Black Cauldron, Jake Speed, Spaceballs, Aria, Deadline, Little Sweetheart, Scandal, L’Oeil qui ment, Monolith, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Contact, The Climb, All the Little Animals, You’re Dead, Lost Souls, Hellboy, Pride, Tabloid, The Proposition, V for Vendetta, Outlander, Boxes, An Englishman in New York, Ultramarines, Whistle and I’ll Come To You, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Only Lovers Left Alive, Snowpiercer, Hercules, and finally the TV miniseries I, Claudius.

Maybe it should be #DontKillJohnHurt.

So is Sean Bean a walking spoiler alert? For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park‘s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths/episode.)

Of course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt). In the years to come, we could see Boromir bite the dust enough to become the undisputed duke of the death scene.

168,"He cast for looks. He compensated by ""turning his back"" when directing a scene. ",http://www.mentorless.com/2016/05/10/how-orson-welles-compensates-for-mistake-in-casting/,"How Orson Welles Compensated for a Mistake He Kept Making When Casting

I have a massive crush for this video interview with Orson Welles shot in Paris in 1967, when the man had fully embraced his persona.

Shot in a restaurant, while eating, surrounded by journalists hanging to his every word, Welles talks about a mistake he has found himself making over and over again during casting, and how he found a way to compensate it while shooting.

So here is what Welles says:

“When I’m casting, I tend to make the mistake of all producers and metteurs en scène (directors), I cast for how you look. I think about (the voice) but how you look is the first consideration.

And then, when I have them on the stage I’m very interested in their voices and it’s too late to change, unless you dub them. I make that mistake a lot. (…)

I think that if (a film) sounds wrong, then it doesn’t look right. Movies depend so much on rhythm. They are so close to music, closer to music than a drama of the theater, that if the sound, and the rhythm of the sound, above all the rhythm, is wrong, no image can save it. Because the rhythm of the sound… I believe sound is the first human sense for the theater, not the eye. I think the first theater was a story told by a storyteller, and it’s a voice, and the voice determines it, and the rhythm of the voice determines the images in some way.

It’s not only what you say, but the rhythm and speed of all the voices in a scene. That’s why often when I direct, I turn my back on a scene.”

—

This was a aha moment for me. Maybe Welles is being Welles, and he was never really turning his back when directing a scene, but I get what he means, and the essence here, even if you don’t want to take it literally, is that ‘sound editing’ when directing your actors is fundamental for a scene to reach its highest potential.

It is in the continuity of Tarantino’s technique to get useful feedback as the screenwriting stage too. Ultimately, if films are moving images, sound is this essential component, this first sense to quote Welles, that glues it all together when it follows the right rhythm.

I love that Welles talked the way you wouldn’t be able to talk today. I can’t imagine any filmmaker admitting that their artistic vision gets clouded by someone’s look over talent to tell a text during casting. But if they do, maybe finding there’s a way to make it work will help.

I know that as I start having my first serious conversations with my producer about casting for In Five Years, Welles’ admission has never felt more useful and relevant.

3. Opening Act: Fans may just want to show up right on time because Joe Jonas and his band DNCE are kicking off the party as the opening performers. Whether it's their catchy hits like ""Cake by the Ocean"" or their unforgettable outfits, the group isn't your average opener. ""LAST NIGHT WAS EPIC!"" the group shared on Instagram after night one. ""THANK U VEGAS! #revivaltour."" Bea Miller is also expected to perform before Selena takes the stage.

4. Charity: As if you needed another reason to buy your tickets. The singer has plans to donate proceeds from each ticket sold to the Alliance for Lupus Research. Back in Oct. 2015, Selena revealed to Billboard that she was diagnosed with lupus. ""I waited for the right time to talk about it because I am in a great place and I'm very healthy,"" she later explained to the publication. "" I'm not trying to be loud about it: It was time to use my platform to help.""

5. Surprises: During this tour, Selena is feeling confident and eager to switch things up when fans least expect it. ""This show is so centered around me, and I mean that in a way of confidence, of strength,"" Gomez shared with Billboard. ""It has a beautiful feel to it, but it is about me, so if I wanted to come in one day and say I want to change [a song in the show] or add this, I can do that."" She continued, ""That's the first time I've ever really been able to do that in my life. And I feel, I feel great about it. It's not me making sure I hit all the dance moves.""",2016-05-08 20:45:26

171,Rickon Stark. ,http://ti.me/1SPI3AH,"Forget that Rickon Stark was a character on Game of Thrones? Us too. Rickon has long lived on the “where the heck is that character” list along with Benjen Stark, Beric Dondarrion and Gendry. (Seriously, where is Gendry? He’s the rightful heir to the throne for goodness sake.)

But the baby of the Stark family is returning to the show, according to actress Maisie Williams.

The Game of Thrones cast is notoriously good at keeping spoilers from fans: For almost an entire year poor Kit Harington had to pretend he’d actually left the show. But during an interview with BBC Radio 1, a caller asked the actress who plays Arya whether we would be hearing from Rickon again this season. “Yes, maybe,” Williams tentatively replied. Later she clarified: “Yes, we will indeed… Oh no, I’m literally going to get off the air and someone’s going to email me!”

We last saw the youngest Stark child way back in season three when he fled a Theon-ruled Winterfell with Bran, Hodor and Osha. Bran instructed Rickon, his Wildling babysitter Osha and direwolf Shaggy Dog (yes, he really named a killer direwolf Shaggy Dog) to head for the Last Hearth, the seat of the House Umber, a family loyal to the Starks) in the North.

Now that Jon Snow is back, he’s going to need to battle the Boltons for the North. Rounding up all the Starks—he’s unlikely to reach Arya or Bran, but he may be able to find Sansa and Rickon—would not only protect them from the Boltons but would rally the families loyal to the Starks in their fight for Winterfell. As they say: The North remembers.

172,Hodor was a warg and stayed in his animal so long that he lost himself. ,http://huff.to/24AXpAk,"HBO

A new theory is sweeping the Internet, and it could even make Hodor say ""damn.""

Besides the whole Jon Snow thing on Sunday's episode of ""Game of Thrones,"" there was one other moment that was almost as shocking:

Advertisement

Hodor talked.

And by talked, we mean he said a hella lot more than ""Hodor.""

In the scene, which was one of Bran's visions into the past, we see Hodor, whose real name is apparently Willis, actually talk to Ned Stark's sister, Lyanna. Sure, he's probably not the sharpest sword in the armory, but he's savvy enough to pick up on a young Benjen Stark's fighting tendencies.

Bran was as surprised as us to discover that Hodor could talk, so how did Willis become the Hodor we know and love today?

Advertisement

Well, Redditors gbinasia and TazoGreenTea have a theory that seems so ridiculous, it actually makes sense.

The theory: Hodor was a warg and stayed in his animal so long that he lost himself.

Whoa-dor.

According to the theory, Hodor was a warg/skinchanger as a kid, but he may have spent too much time in his animal, causing him to lose a part of himself (something Jojen Reed once warned Bran about).

Advertisement

There's also the possibility that Hodor's animal was killed while he was warging into it, which is a traumatic event for a skinchanger. This could've led him to lose his mind.

But if Hodor was a warg, what animal would he change into? Gbinasia explains that the obvious choice is Lyanna's horse:

As a stable boy, it would make sense that his choice would be to warg into a horse since, like dogs, they are docile and are accustomed to his presence. And if the (possibly) only girl treating him nicely was Lyanna, it would make complete sense that this is the horse he would warg into.

From the books, we know Lyanna died at the Tower of Joy. Could Hodor, as her horse, have died there, as well? Or was he perhaps killed in some battle? Is this the real reason Hodor became ... well ... Hodor?

The evidence

1. A whole section in George R.R. Martin's books compares Hodor to a horse.

Redditor PliersD3 points out that in Martin's second book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Clash of Kings, Hodor is straight-up called a horse:

Little Walder cast his splintered lance aside, spied Bran, and reined up. “Now there’s an ugly horse,” he said of Hodor. “Hodor’s no horse,” Bran said.

“Hodor,” said Hodor.

Big Walder trotted up to join his cousin. “Well, he’s not as smart as a horse, that’s for certain.” Is this a hint into the truth about Hodor? There's more, too. Little Walder even speculates that Hodor means ""I love you"" in horse. Plus, in Martin's novel, A Game of Thrones, there's a line where Maester Luwin says, ""Hodor is a man, not a mule to be beaten.” Uh, no offense, Luwin, but this theory begs to differ, bruh.

2. Hodor has taken on the characteristics of a horse.

HBO

After Bran loses the use of his legs in the book, he's often described as riding around on Hodor's back. Also, Hodor appears to fear the dark and lightning like horses might, as revealed in this excerpt from A Storm of Swords:

Advertisement

The lightning flashed again, and this time the thunder came at six. “Hodor!” Hodor yelled again. “HODOR! HODOR!” He snatched up his sword, as if to fight the storm.

3. Wargs can lose their minds when their animals are killed.

A precedent has already been set for when a warg's animal is killed. In Martin's books, Melisandre kills an eagle that has a wildling warg in it. The wildling goes mad because of it, losing control of his other animals.

4. The three-eyed raven has been watching Hodor all along.

Redditor TazoGreenTea brings up a scene from Season 4 where the three-eyed raven tells Hodor, Bran and Meera, ""I've been watching you -- all of you -- all of your lives.""

Why would the raven be watching Hodor if there wasn't a reason to? Did Hodor once have visions like Bran did?

In the Bran flashback scene, we see Lyanna on a horse, Hodor talking and the three-eyed raven warning Bran not to stay in visions too long. It seems a little random, but if the theory is true, then it all makes sense. If Bran stays in visions or wargs for too long, he may lose himself like Hodor.

When The Huffington Post once asked George R.R. Martin about the origins of Hodor, he wouldn't reveal the answer. Could this theory be the reason why Hodor is Hodor? Or are we barking up the wrong Hodor?",2016-05-08 20:42:44
173,Captain America should have been gay. ,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/captain-america-civil-war-steve-rogers-sharon-carter-bucky-barnes,"This post contains spoilers for Captain America: Civil War. If you haven’t seen the film yet or don’t want to be spoiled on anything, now is that time to go. Spoilers ahoy after one more firm warning from Cap.

If you’re not deep into internet culture, you may be unaware of the intensely devoted section of the Captain America fan base who consider Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), not Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), to be the true object of Steve Rogers’ (Chris Evans) affection. Oh but they’re out there. Just search Bucky/Steve and you’ll see what I mean. But make sure you have the safe search mode switched on first.

When Captain America: Civil War directors Joe and Anthony Russo went on a publicity tour for the latest installment in Marvel’s Avengers franchise, they were very careful not to throw cold water on the popular fan theory that Steve “Captian America” Rogers and Bucky “The Winter Soldier” Barnes were more than friends. “People can interpret the relationship however they want to interpret it,” Joe Russo said while visiting China. “People have interpreted that relationship all kinds of ways, and it’s great to see people argue about it what that relationship means to them. We will never define it as filmmakers, explicitly, but however people want to interpret it they can interpret it.”

Even Evans and Stan seemed happy to throw fuel on the Bucky/Steve theories during the publicity tour.

But despite what Joe Russo said, doesn’t Captain America: Civil War go out of its way to “define” Bucky and Steve’s relationship when Cap smooches Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) while Bucky looks on approvingly? Where’s the room for interpretation in that moment? And, leaving aside the vague creepiness of Steve making a move on Peggy’s (very willing) niece, the moment itself wasn’t necessary to the flow of the movie at all.

As was the case in Captain America: Winter Soldier, VanCamp is a hugely appealing (if slightly underused) member of the cast. The film even gave her one of Captain’s most iconic comic book speeches when Sharon and Steve are mulling over how to move forward in the shadow of Peggy’s death. It’s a great moment for her and for the story. And while I think Agent Peggy Carter would have encouraged Agent Sharon Carter to join in the big fight on the tarmac, in general Sharon’s insider access to the government served the story very well.",2016-05-08 20:42:15
