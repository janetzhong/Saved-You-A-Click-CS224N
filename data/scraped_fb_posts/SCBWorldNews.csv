",http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/brexit-travel-europe-holidays-ehic-medical-bills-a7135086.html,"Britain's vote to leave the European Union is expected to trigger a rush in new applications for special health insurance cards that entitle travellers to discounted medical bills on the continent.

According to data obtained by This Is Money, seven million European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) cards are due to expire this year. If caught out, tourists will have to pay more in medical bills than expected.

This further adds to the worries of UK citizens who fear Brexit could mean the loss of cheaper medical bills abroad.

When in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, EHIC cards enable the holder to receive emergency medical care at the same cost and standard as state-provided care in the country.

According to the NHS, this means cardholders receive treatment “at a reduced cost or, in many cases, for free.”

After submitting a freedom of information request to the NHS business services authority, This Is Money revealed that 7,196,592 EHIC cards are set to expire this year.

The number expiring this year is unprecedented and marks an increase of 66% when compared with 2015.

Last year 4,333,892 cards expired, whilst only 2,797,576 expired in 2014. However, data is only stored for two years and This Is Money warned: “This wasn’t reflective of the whole of that year”.

The findings suggest that a large number of UK tourists are set to be caught out if they produce an expired EHIC card when in Europe. Failure to produce a valid card may result in expensive private medical treatment.

Reminders are not sent out to EHIC cardholders and it is the responsibility of the owner to renew his card.

All adults over the age of 16 require their own EHIC card to benefit from the reduced cost in medical expenses. An EHIC card is free but This Is Money warned: “several websites have been set up in the past few years selling EHIC cards for a fee.

“However, these sites are a scam and you… can apply for an EHIC card through the official EHIC website, by calling 0300 330 1350 or by printing an application on the NHS website.”",2016-07-14 12:00:01

Now, 70 years later, high-tech imaging techniques have helped shine a light onto the dark – yet profoundly inspirational – story of what took place there.

An international team of archaeologists has uncovered a 35-meter (115-foot) long tunnel that Jewish prisoners secretly dug with spoons and their bare hands to escape a Nazi massacre site in Lithuania's Ponar forest, a site where 100,000 people had been killed.

Researchers from Israel, Lithuania, Canada, and the US used electrical resistivity tomography to avoid disturbing the bodies in the mass graves, an imaging technique commonly used in mineral and oil exploration that shows up changes in electrical properties underground. Their imaging showed that a tunnel started in a pit, used to imprison the captives, and led to an open space in the forest.

“To find a little glimmer of hope within the dark hole of Ponar is very important as humans. The tunnel shows that even when the time was so black, there was yearning for life within that,” Jon Seligman, an archaeologist with Israel’s antiquities authority who participated in the expedition, told Associated Press.",2016-07-09 14:23:57

",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/pro-leave-mp-tells-journalist-to-suck-it-up-whiner-over-brexit-concerns-a7105701.html,"A pro-Leave politician has been criticised for calling a journalist a “whiner” for expressing concerns about the result of the EU referendum, before dismissing those “in denial” about the vote.

Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, campaigned in support of Brexit and told GQ’s political correspondent Rupert Myers to “suck it up” during a brief exchange on Twitter on Sunday evening.

Myers had written: “I can’t get over the fact that the winning side lied about a whole bunch of stuff and yet expect us to live cheerfully with the result.”

The MP replied: “I know you’re struggling to cope with representative democracy & the decision of 17m people to disagree with you but chin up.”

Mr Jackson’s comments were spotted and retweeted by author J.K.Rowling, who wrote: “Welcome to our post-referendum, anti-elitist, in-touch-with-the-people politicians.”

In response, Mr Jackson told Peterborough Today: “I could not care less what JK Rowling thinks. It’s got nothing to do with her.

“There’s a campaign to de-legitimise the result which is the largest number of people voting for anything in British electoral history.

“There’s an attempt to say people who voted to leave were stupid and did not understand the issue. That’s nonsense. We need a period of humility from people who are in denial.”

Mr Jackson also dismissed criticisms aimed at the leave campaign - including suggestions £350 million more a week will not now be spent on the NHS.

He added: “The point is there’s £350 million that has to be allocated to the EU. It’s up to the Government now - it might spend it on the NHS, adult social care, school places. We will have that choice to make.”

5,"1) Acquisition of Irish citizenship through descent, 2) marriage, or 3) ""citizenship by investment"" (basically buying your citizenship). ",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-eu-referendum-how-can-i-keep-my-eu-passport-travel-a7100091.html,"A passport from a European Union country confers the right to live and work in any other EU nation, and soon UK citizens will lose that right. After the Leave vote, some speculated that they could renew their passport immediately and remain a citizen of the EU for the next 10 years. That option will not work. Even though the cover of a British passport reads ""European Union"" at the top, when the UK leaves Europe, it ceases to be an EU passport.

Accordingly, many people will decide it is rational to seek an alternative passport. But how difficult is it?

The easiest route for some will be to acquire Irish citizenship through descent - a process that is straightforward if you have the good fortune to have an Irish parent. It doesn't matter if they were born in the Republic or Northern Ireland; it's the island of Ireland that counts.

The government in Dublin says: “If either of your parents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, then you are automatically an Irish citizen, irrespective of your place of birth. If you were born outside Ireland to an Irish citizen who was himself or herself born outside Ireland, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen.”

✕ David Cameron resigns as PM

Even if neither of your parents is an Irish citizen, you can go back another generation: to citizenship through descent from Irish grandparents.

The Irish government says if one of your grandparents is an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, you can have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register - and, “If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration.”

This lineage can continue through the generations: if you are (or become) an Irish citizen, this status can be passed on “by each generation ensuring their registration in the Foreign Births Register before the birth of the next generation”.

He is likely to reassure nationals of other EU countries living in the UK that their status is unchanged. That is what the Leave campaign has said, so, even after the Brexit negotiations are complete, those who are already in the UK would be allowed to stay Getty 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you Higher inflation A lower pound means that imports would become more expensive. This is likely to mean the return of inflation – a phenomenon with which many of us are unfamiliar because prices have been stable for so long, rising at no more than about 2 per cent a year. The effect may probably not be particularly noticeable in the first few months. At first price rises would be confined to imported goods – food and clothes being the most obvious – but inflation has a tendency to spread and to gain its own momentum AFP/Getty Images 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you Interest rates might rise The trouble with inflation is that the Bank of England has a legal obligation to keep it as close to 2 per cent a year as possible. If a fall in the pound threatens to push prices up faster than this, the Bank will raise interest rates. This acts against inflation in three ways. First, it makes the pound more attractive, because deposits in pounds will earn higher interest. Second, it reduces demand by putting up the cost of borrowing, and especially by taking larger mortgage payments out of the economy. Third, it makes it more expensive for businesses to borrow to expand output Getty 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you Did somebody say recession? Mr Carney, the Treasury and a range of international economists have warned about this. Many Leave voters appear not to have believed them, or to think that they are exaggerating small, long-term effects. But there is no doubt that the Leave vote is a negative shock to the economy. This is because it changes expectations about the economy’s future performance. Even though Britain is not actually be leaving the EU for at least two years, companies and investors will start to move money out of Britain, or to scale back plans for expansion, because they are less confident about what would happen after 2018 AFP/Getty Images 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you And we wouldn’t even get our money back All this will be happening while the Prime Minister, whoever he or she is, is negotiating the terms of our future access to the EU single market. In the meantime, our trade with the EU would be unaffected, except that companies elsewhere in the EU may be less interested in buying from us or selling to us, expecting tariff barriers to go up in two years’ time.

If your genes are geopolitically unhelpful, the next possible route to an EU passport is marriage. But don’t expect instant results. Each country makes its own rules on how long it takes to acquire citizenship, and they are generally designed to avoid marriages of convenience. For example, the spouse of a citizen of Malta can become a citizen of the island only after five years of wedded bliss.

The final option is open only to those with the right kind of bank balance: buying your way in to EU nationality, with a “citizenship by investment” scheme that many countries offer. According to KPMG, Cyprus is “the ‘jurisdiction of choice’ for many high net worth individuals and their families”. The price tag is investing €5m in the island.",2016-06-24 08:57:27
6,A startling number of sexual assaults were committed by serial rapists. ,http://www.attn.com/stories/8902/researchers-tested-backlogged-rape-kits-revealed-startling-truth-about-sexual-assault,"On Monday, researchers from Case Western University released the results of an investigation into backlogged rape kits in Ohio's Cuyahoga County. Included in the results are some noteworthy findings about the behaviors of serial rapists and one time offenders.

The data, which was reported by the Cut, revealed that a startling number of sexual assaults were committed by serial rapists.

According to the Cut, the Case Western study is related to a larger effort to process a huge backlog of rape kits in the Cleveland area. Researchers were able to look at 248 high priority rape case files, and found noteworthy differences between serial rapists and one time offenders.

""About a quarter of the serial offenders in this sample had previously been arrested for sexual assault, and 60 percent would have a subsequent sexual-assault arrest. The majority of both serial and onetime sexual offenders had a history of a felony-level arrest, but serial offenders' histories were more extensive and violent. Serial rapists were also more likely to kidnap their victims, commit the assault outdoors, and threaten victims with a weapon.

Case Western researchers also wrote in a brief that ""it is very likely that a sexual offender has either previously sexually assaulted or will offend again in the future.""

As result, they recommend authorities alter their approach to investigating rape cases.

""Investigating each sexual assault as possibly being perpetrated by a serial offender has the potential to reduce the number of sexual assaults if the focus of the investigation is more on the offender than on a single incident. Serial offenders have traditionally been investigated according to the consistency of the assault or the MO (e.g., who they assault, where they assault, how they assault). For example, our findings seem to suggest that MOs (while definitely important to track for investigative purposes, especially when DNA is present) are not a consistently reliable link across assaults and thus a missed opportunity to solve unsolved sexual assaults and an opportunity to prevent future offending.""

We don't know exactly how many untested rape kits are out there.

""We cannot be sure of the total number of untested kits nationwide because most jurisdictions do not have systems for tracking or counting rape kits,"" End the Backlog reports. ""Additionally, there is no federal law mandating a nationwide movement toward tracking and testing rape kits, despite efforts by some members of Congress to pass such legislation. However a growing number of states, all across the country, are making real reforms to end the backlog.""

In late May, the Senate unanimously voted to pass a bill that would grant rights to victims of sexual assault.

""The Senate measure would generally require that victims be notified of the results of rape kit tests, including any DNA matches, as well as toxicology reports that could show whether they had been given a date-rape drug, for instance,"" the New York Times reported.

""The bill would also ensure that rape kits would be preserved without charge for 20 years or until the statute of limitations expires, whichever comes first,"" the Times added.

Still, it's important to acknowledge that only a small fraction of victims of sexual assault report incidents to law enforcement.

Sixty-eight percent of sexual assault victims do not report incidents to the police, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN).

7,"Kansas' economy suffered, California's economy grew. ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/17/one-state-raised-taxes-the-other-cut-them-guess-which-one-is-in-recession/?campaign_id=A100&campaign_type=Email,"Neither of those predictions came true. Not right away -- California grew just fine in the year the tax hikes took effect -- and especially not in the medium term, as new economic data showed this week.

Now, correlation does not, as they say, equal causation, and two examples are but a small sample. But the divergent experiences of California and Kansas run counter to a popular view, particularly among conservative economists, that tax cuts tend to supercharge growth and tax increases chill it.

California's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth of the year. That was up from 3.1 percent growth for the Golden State in 2014, which was near the top of the national pack.

The Kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015. That's down from 1.2 percent in 2014, and below neighboring states such as Nebraska (2.1 percent) and Missouri (1.2 percent). Kansas ended the year with two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- a shrinking economy. By a common definition of the term, the state entered 2016 in recession.

Other effects of the Kansas tax cuts, which were meant to spur entrepreneurship, are well-documented.

While state officials anticipated that the reductions would create a shortfall in the state budget, tax revenues have been consistently below even those expectations. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service have signaled that they could reduce Kansas’s credit rating, indicating there is a chance the state cannot pay its bills.

The shortfalls have forced Gov. Sam Brownback (R) and lawmakers to make additional adjustments. The state canceled the initial reduction in sales taxes, then increased them again, while delaying additional scheduled reductions in the income tax.

On the whole, Brownback’s policies modestly increased taxes for the poor and working class, who pay more in sales taxes than income taxes, while reducing taxes drastically for the rich.

The poorest 20 percent of households -- those making less than $23,000 a year -- are paying about $200 more, on average, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington. For the middle class, the changes have been a wash, with less-affluent households paying somewhat more and more-affluent households giving up a little less.

Meanwhile, the wealthiest 1 percent of households, those making at least $493,000 a year, are saving an average of $25,000.

Kansas’s gross domestic product is still less than it was at the end of 2011, said Menzie Chinn, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has been following Kansas’s economy. Meanwhile, the economy in the rest of the country continues to expand.

“It’s remarkable,” Chinn said.

It is perhaps less remarkable -- or surprising -- that California has powered along. The recovery nationwide has favored massive metropolitan areas stocked with high-skilled workers, which is to say places such as Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco. The damage from California's deep housing crash has slowly healed in places such as the Central Valley.

Still, the noncoastal regions of California lag far behind Silicon Valley and Los Angeles in their job and growth recoveries. The state's median income remains below pre-recession levels after adjustment for inflation, although it still beats the national average.

Few, if any, economists would say today that the recovery has been sufficient for all Californians. But almost no one can say that raising taxes on the rich killed that recovery. Or that given a choice of the two states' economic performances over the past few years, you'd rather be Kansas.",2016-06-23 11:00:00

But they weren't prepared for what they found when they arrived.

The protestors were blocked by volunteers who dressed up as angels, with huge white sheets held up from their shoulders to block the signs, and chants, from the Westboro Baptist Church protestors.

The ""Angel Action"" counter-protest can be traced back almost 30 years, to 1999, when WBC members picketed the funeral of Laramie, Wyoming gay teen, Matthew Shepard where friends of the murdered teen dressed up in similar outfits to block protestors at the murder trials of the two men responsible for his tragic death.

The angels at Saturday's funerals were members of the Orlando Shakespeare Theater, and their actions were met with hugs and tears from the grateful family and friends of those lost in the tragic shooting.

The chants of the WBC were also drowned out by the angelic volunteers singing ""Amazing Grace,"" in a beautiful and emotional sing of solidarity and support.",2016-06-23 10:00:00

Even though the holiday is a joyous occasion, I felt tears in my eyes as I recited our sacred prayers.

I had not been to a bar in more than 20 years. And I had never been to a gay bar. Someone in the congregation told me about a bar called the Fireplace, so I announced that as our destination. Afterward, I found out it was predominantly frequented by gay African Americans.

Approximately a dozen of us, wearing our kippot, or yarmulkes, went down as soon as the holiday ended. Some of the members of our group are gay, but most are not. We did not know what to expect. As we gathered outside, we saw one large, drunk man talking loudly and wildly. I wondered whether we were in the right place. Then my mother, who was with me, went up to a man who was standing on the side of the building. She told him why we were there. He broke down in tears and told us his cousin was killed at Pulse. He embraced us and invited us into the Fireplace.

We didn’t know what to expect, but it turned out that we had so much in common. We met everyone in the bar. One of the patrons told me that his stepchildren were actually bar-mitzvahed in our congregation. Another one asked for my card so that his church could come and visit. The bartender shut off all of the music in the room, and the crowd became silent as we offered words of prayer and healing. My co-clergy Maharat Ruth Friedman shared a blessing related to the holiday of Shavuot, and she lit memorial candles on the bar ledge. Then everyone in the bar put their hands around each other’s shoulders, and we sang soulful tunes. After that, one of our congregants bought a round of beer for the whole bar.

Everyone in the bar embraced each other. It was powerful and moving and real and raw.

After that we moved to the outdoor makeshift memorial service at Dupont Circle. There, too, we did not know what to expect. But as we gathered around the circle, people kept coming up to us and embracing us. One man we met there told us that his daughter sometimes prays with us. Others were visiting from Los Angeles but joined in full voice, clearly knowing the Hebrew words to the song we were singing.

As we were singing, I looked over at some gay members of our congregation and saw tears flowing down their faces. I felt the reality that we are living in a time of enormous pain. But I also felt that the night was a tremendous learning experience for me. I learned that when a rabbi and members of an Orthodox synagogue walk into a gay African American bar, it is not the opening line of a joke but an opportunity to connect; it is an opportunity to break down barriers and come together as one; it is an opportunity to learn that if we are going to survive, we all need each other.

12,Not really. ,http://www.npr.org/2016/06/15/482113672/are-gop-women-warming-up-to-trump,"Are GOP Women Warming Up To Donald Trump?

Enlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR

It's no secret that Donald Trump has struggled to win over female voters. Polls show more than 60 percent of women have an unfavorable opinion of the presumptive Republican nominee.

But, as the campaign pivots to the general election, are Republican women reconsidering Trump? It's this group of largely white women Trump needs in November.

In the key battleground state of Ohio, there are plenty of women who adore Trump — and plenty of women who despise him. But many Republican women seem to be somewhere in the middle. They may not like Trump's tone, but they're willing to vote for him, or willing to be persuaded.

""He is a rough talker, but it's not a big deal. Everybody seems so thin-skinned,"" says Diana Forrester, a longtime Republican voter. ""He's raised some wonderful children, and that tells you a lot about a person.""

Outside of her suburban Columbus house, Forrester flies an American flag. Inside, she has pictures of her family — including her son, a National Guardsman who was killed four years ago in Afghanistan by a suicide bomber.

""I don't believe we can continue to go in the direction we're going. We've got to change our direction,"" Forrester explains over chicken sandwiches and fruit on a hot summer day at her house.

She's upset by President Obama's leadership and his desire to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay.

""Why are we arguing about bathrooms?"" she asks, referencing the debate around transgender bills. ""It makes no sense to me. It's like everyone's gone crazy. ... Our sons and daughters are being killed on foreign soil, and we're worrying about bathrooms?""

Forrester says the Orlando shooting proves, once again, that even on U.S. soil, Americans are not safe.

""You can't send a child to school and be certain they will come home safe. You can't go to a restaurant and be sure you won't be shot over your soup,"" she says.

National security is her main concern, and she thinks Trump is the best candidate to protect the country. But Ohio is a place where security moms meet Midwestern manners, and Trump's tactics and tone ruffle a lot of feathers.

""I don't know how he's going to mend fences with women in general,"" says state Rep. Barbara Sears, who described Trump's attitude as ""condescending and simplistic.""

Sears is a delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich at the Republican National Convention this summer. She was a loyal Kasich supporter, and campaigned for him across five different states when he was running for president.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR

But now that Kasich is out of the running, she plans to support Trump — it's a matter of pragmatism and party loyalty, she says.

""Philosophically I'm a Republican, lean more toward the conservative side, and so the idea of moving away from some semblance of a conservative side would just not be acceptable to me,"" she explains. ""So, yes, I'll support Donald Trump ... and rally behind that, because that's the philosophy I want guiding the ship down in D.C.""

But does she like Trump?

""I'm still trying to decide whether I like him or not, but I don't know whether I have to like the president. I have to respect the president's ability to lead the country, right? I don't have to be overly excited about the idea of having a cup of coffee with him,"" she says.

At a park in a wealthy suburb just outside Columbus, moms in sun hats watch their kids in bathing suits splash through water fountains. It's the kind of park where you see Muslim, Latino and black families — and Kasich-style Republicans, like Rachel Pugar, 29.

""We're not thrilled with Donald Trump,"" she says with a laugh, nodding to her husband, who stands nearby in a pair of scrubs watching their daughter.

Pugar says they supported Kasich in the primaries and worry that Trump doesn't understand foreign policy.

""I think he's a little bit dangerous,"" she says. ""I don't like the way he talks about women and minorities. ... He just doesn't seem like a very stable candidate.""

But come Election Day, she says, she will probably still vote for him ""because we dislike Hillary even more.""

NPR spoke to about two-dozen Republican women from Columbus to Cleveland for this story, and many of them said they would vote for Trump even if they don't like his tone or his character.

But a few women were adamant that Trump is a choice they cannot accept. So, they say, they simply will not vote for president this November; they insist they'll vote for down-ballot elections, but they'll leave the top of the ticket blank.

""He's just so liberal to me, so liberal,"" says Sandy Nowak, who voted for Ted Cruz in the primary.

Nowak worries that Trump is not a true conservative.

""I just feel like I can't, in good faith, go vote for him and then sit back with a good conscience,"" she says. ""I don't necessarily trust him as a person. ... I feel like if we get him, we're saying goodbye to the Republican Party as we've known it.

Her best friend, Tamara Frazier, seems a little more open to persuasion.

""I'm willing to sit back and listen and see what he does over the next few months,"" she says. ""I'm still expecting him to be Donald Trump. I'm sure he's going to say things that just make me go, 'Oh!' ""

Frazier says some days she's optimistic that Trump is heading in the right direction.

""A lot of times he's on late-night talk shows, and he's being very calm and reasonable, and I'm sitting there going, 'OK, it's possible he could have good manners,' "" she says.

But then, she says, she's reminded of the insults he's hurled at women, mainly because of an ad she's seen on TV that she can't get out of her mind; it's an anti-Trump ad made by a superPAC supporting Hillary Clinton, in which women wearing Trump T-shirts mouth Trump's own words regarding women.

""They're hitting everything from short women to Megyn Kelly. ... I'm not kidding, every time ... that crazy commercial comes on, it puts me in the worst mood toward him,"" she says.

The problem for Trump is that Democrats already have a built-in advantage with women. So, he can't afford to have a Republican woman like Frazier sitting on the sidelines.",2016-06-15 15:24:18

",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/6/9/1536703/-A-USA-Today-Investigation-That-Should-Surprise-Nobody,"USA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn’t pay his bills

""During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah's at Trump Plaza.

""The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder. ""Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. “That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company… which has been around since my grandfather,” he said.

""Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will ""protect your job."" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades – and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.

""At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.

""Trump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.

""In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens – filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work – since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.

""The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.""",2016-06-10 09:00:00

Sunny and windy weather lit up the country's solar and wind farms, causing a surge of clean energy that amounted to almost all of Germany’s 45.8 gigawatt daily demand. Topped up by the supply from traditional power plants, the sum of energy being produced that day was well in excess of the amount needed.

And that means that for a brief moment in time, energy prices were negative: consumers were effectively being paid to use energy.

The below chart shows Germany's power production and consumption on 8 May 2016: you can see the gigawatts peaking between 10am and 12am.

Germany isn’t the only country living the green dream: for four consecutive days last month, Portugal managed to run entirely on wind, solar and hydro power. It’s a bright point in a generally cheery picture for Portugal, with renewable sources now providing almost half its energy each year.

Sixteen countries have now hit 100% renewable electricity production, according to 2013 data from the Energy Information Administration. Costa Rica made headlines recently by running entirely on clean energy for 75 days of 2015.

",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/08/the-remarkable-ways-a-little-money-can-change-a-childs-personality-for-life/,"For these families, the extra padding was a blessing, enough to boost household incomes by almost 20 percent on average. But for the fields of psychology, sociology and economics, it has been a gold mine, too. The sudden change in fortunes has offered a rare glimpse into the subtle but important ways in which money can alter a child’s life. The dataset is so rich that researchers continue to study it to this day.

""It would be almost impossible to replicate this kind of longitudinal study,” said Randall Akee, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the impact of changes in household income. “Especially for a sample this large. This is the sort of circumstance you dream of as a researcher.""

Seizing the opportunity, Akee, along with a team of other researchers, recently revisited the data to analyze each child’s personality both in the years before the casino was built and in those after.

As part of the original study, the children and parents were asked a series of questions, designed to measure, among other things, a number of personality traits. The same questions were posed every other year, for a decade. Akee's goal was to observe any changes—positive or negative—resulting from the extra household income. Their findings, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research last month, are nothing short of remarkable.

""This was hugely important to the development of the children, to their wellbeing” said Akee. ""And the effect wasn’t small either—it was actually fairly large.""

Not only did the extra income appear to lower the instance of behavioral and emotional disorders among the children, but, perhaps even more important, it also boosted two key personality traits that tend to go hand in hand with long-term positive life outcomes.

The first is conscientiousness. People who lack it tend to lie, break rules and have trouble paying attention. The second is agreeableness, which leads to a comfort around people and aptness for teamwork. And both are strongly correlated with various forms of later life success and happiness.

The researchers also observed a slight uptick in neuroticism, which, they explained, is a good sign. Neuroticism is generally considered to be a positive trait so long as one does not have too much of it.

""We're talking about all sorts of good, positive, long-term things,"" said Emilia Simeonova, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies the economics of health, and one of the paper's co-authors. ""There are very powerful correlations between conscientiousness and agreeableness and the ability to hold a job, to maintain a steady relationship. The two allow for people to succeed socially and professionally.""

Remarkably, the change was the most pronounced in the children who were the most deficient. ""This actually reduces inequality with respect to personality traits,"" said Akee. ""On average, everyone is benefiting, but in particular it's helping the people who need it the most.""

Story continues below advertisement

Why exactly this happened with the children neither Akee nor any of his co-researchers can say with absolute certainty. Not even Jane Costello, a professor at Duke University who was part of the team that initiated the original study and co-authored the recent paper can say. But they have a few ideas, based on observable changes in the families after the casino was built and the extra money started to flow in.

They know, based on the interviews with parents, that the relationship between spouses tended to improve as a result. They also know that the relationship between the parents and their children tended to improve. And they know that parents tended to drink less alcohol.

""There is a lot of literature that shows in order to change outcomes among children you are best off treating the parents first,"" said Simeonova. ""And these are really clear changes in the parents.""

Story continues below advertisement

There's also the question of stress, which the extra money helps relieve—even if only a little. While the added income wasn't enough to allow parents to quit their jobs, it's a base level that helped with rent and food and other basic expenses. That, Akee said, is powerful enough itself.

""We know that the thing poor couples fight about the most is money,"" he said. ""Off the bat, this means a more harmonious family environment.""

And some of the families, given the boost, even moved to areas with slightly better census tracts in terms of both income and education. They were, in other words, able to expose their children to a different group of peers.

Story continues below advertisement

For the most part, scientists agree that the window for improvement in a child's cognitive abilities is short-lived. By the age of about 8, children have set themselves on a path, Akee said. What comes next happens, more or less, within the confines of the limits that were created in their early years.

One's personality, on the other hand, is malleable well into adolescence. What's more, the changes tend to be fairly permanent.

""All of the evidence points to the idea if they change in the teenage years, they will stay changed forever,"" said Akee. ""In this case, the kids will likely maintain a different level of conscientiousness and agreeableness for life.""

Experts have known about the power of intervention for some time. A lot of previous research has shown that educational interventions can have sizable impacts on personality traits and, in turn, life outcomes. But rarely, if ever before, have researchers been able to observe the impact of a change in income across such a large group.

The takeaway isn't that casinos are inherently benevolent institutions. But rather that money—even modest sums—can be a pretty powerful thing. And for reasons most would likely overlook.",2016-06-10 07:30:00

",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ozone-pollution-rules-delay_us_5759af44e4b0ced23ca7571c?section=politics,"The House passed a bill that would delay stricter ozone rules by a decade or so. Priyanka Parashar/Mint via Getty Images

The House passed a bill on Wednesday that would delay the Environmental Protection Agency’s new ozone regulations for perhaps another decade -- a move that could endanger the health of millions of Americans.

The EPA’s October 2015 regulations lowered the limit for ground-level ozone pollution -- otherwise known as smog, which forms when nitrogen oxide reacts with volatile organic compounds in the air. The rules had been in the works for seven years, and even the updated standard was not low enough to please a number of public health and environmental groups.

But business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argue that the new standard is too strict and will hurt industry. They scored a win with the House bill, sponsored by Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas), which would push back implementation of the rules by 10 years.

Olson said in a statement that the bill is simply a “common sense"" effort to provide “needed flexibility so that states and localities can adequately achieve new, lower standards with time for compliance.”

Business advocates are understandably pleased. “Manufacturers are encouraged to see House leaders pursue much-needed legislation to reduce the burdens and inflexibilities associated with the 2015 ozone standards,” said Ross Eisenberg, NAM's vice president of energy and resources policy, in a statement.

But environmental, science and health advocacy groups contend that such a delay would increase dangerous air pollution. On June 7, 116 organizations signed a letter warning that the bill ""could well result in communities being exposed to unhealthy levels of smog and soot and sulfur dioxide and even toxic lead pollution.""

The White House has made it clear that President Barack Obama would veto the bill if it passed the Senate, releasing a statement on Tuesday that said it “would jeopardize progress toward cleaner air and significantly delay health benefits worth billions of dollars for millions of Americans.”

Ozone pollution can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, including asthma attacks, wheezing and increased risk of stroke and early death, according to the American Lung Association. The dangers are considered even greater for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and people with pre-existing lung and heart conditions.",2016-06-10 06:33:45

Turner was convicted in March on three felony counts of sexual assault.

According to Turner's inmate details, which are available to the public, he will be released on Sept. 2, 2016.

County of Santa Clara

Public Information Officer Sgt. James Jensen, from the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office, said over the phone the date that appears on the site is indeed when the court has instructed officials to release Turner, although he could not say that the sentence has been formally shortened.

When asked if it's possible that the release date suggests Brock may be moved to another corrections facility, Jensen said, ""That would not be a possibility.""

""If it says he's getting released on that date — unless there's some special circumstance and he receives new criminal charges while in prison and were to be charged — that is the date of his release,"" said Jensen.

An unnamed representative from the same sheriff's office told TMZ that Turner is being held in ""protective custody"" away from any inmates who aren't also in protective custody, and will have an escort who will accompany him on prison grounds.

According to the representative, Turner was eligible to receive these protections by virtue of him serving time for sexual assault and ""those type of inmates are often targeted,"" wrote TMZ staff.

20,"""Brexit"" is the option for Britain to leave the European Union. Proponents cite the economy and immigration control. Opponents cite damage to trade and a potential recession. ",http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/09/news/economy/eu-referendum-brexit-what-would-happen/index.html,"Later this month, Britain may do what no country has done before and vote to leave the European Union.

Opinion polls suggest the public is split down the middle. The referendum on June 23 is too close to call.

Those in favor of walking out of the EU -- the Brexit option -- say European rules stifle U.K. business and leaving would boost the economy. They also say Britain would regain control of its borders and be able to limit immigration.

Those campaigning for the U.K. to stay -- including the government -- paint a much grimmer picture of life outside the EU. They say trade and investment would suffer, triggering a recession, killing jobs, slamming the pound and causing house prices to fall.

The referendum is the biggest decision Brits have faced in a generation. The last direct vote on the country's ties with Europe was in 1975.

A win for Brexit would shape the future of the U.K. and Europe for decades to come. The big problem is that nobody knows exactly how.

Government crisis?

Prime Minister David Cameron would face huge pressure to resign. He is campaigning for Britain to stay in the bloc, but his Conservative party (and government) is bitterly divided over the issue.

Fellow Conservative and former London mayor Boris Johnson leads the Brexit campaign and may be a candidate to succeed Cameron.

Whoever leads the government, he or she would eventually have to give formal notice to the other 27 EU countries of the U.K.'s intention to quit.

There is no deadline for that to happen, but once it does there is no turning back. The U.K. would then have two years to negotiate its divorce from the EU -- including the terms of trade with its 440 million remaining consumers.

Economic turmoil?

The U.K. government, the International Monetary Fund, the Bank of England, Fed Reserve Chief Janet Yellen, President Obama and other world leaders have all warned that leaving the EU would hurt the U.K. economy -- the fifth biggest in the world.

They're worried about the impact on trade. By leaving, Britain would lose its automatic right to trade freely with the rest of the EU, which currently buys about 45% of British exports. The EU is an even bigger market for British services, such as banking and insurance.

On the other side, ""Brexiteers"" say the government could negotiate a new free trade agreement. But no country outside the EU has been able to secure that kind of privileged access to European markets without agreeing to pay into the EU budget or to accept free movement of citizens -- principles rejected by the Brexit campaign.

Investment and employment may also suffer. Many U.S. companies are heavily invested in Britain and use it as a gateway to the rest of Europe. So they may scale back in the U.K.

Other EU countries poured £496 billion ($708 billion) into Britain in 2014 -- almost half of all foreign investment. Those campaigning to remain in the EU say the flow of money could fall if the U.K. severs its links with the bloc. Many companies sell goods from their U.K. factories to other EU countries, and Brexit would make that harder.

A recent survey by professional services firm EY found that 72% of global companies see access to Europe as a key factor in deciding where to put their money. Nearly a third intended to either freeze or reduce their investment in the U.K. until the result of the referendum is known. Real estate investment has already been hit hard.

World leaders: Brexit is a 'serious risk to growth'

U.K. officials have said that up to 820,000 jobs could be lost if Britain leaves the EU. Several global companies have hinted they might shift jobs out of the U.K. The latest warning came from JPMorgan (JPM) last week.

Some Brexit campaigners have acknowledged that a vote to quit the EU could initially cost Britain jobs.

What happens to millions of migrants?

Migration is another hot topic. One of the core principles of the EU is the free movement of people, which gives citizens of any member state the right to live and work in any of the 28 countries in the union.

Those in favor of Brexit say leaving the bloc would allow the U.K. to decide which migrants to let in.

But an exit from the EU would raise questions about the status of roughly 3 million people from other EU states who currently live in the U.K. Campaigners say they would be allowed to stay, but future EU migrants would likely need a visa.

Brexit would also impact the roughly 1.2 million Brits living in other EU countries, as they could lose their right to travel around freely and access benefits such as healthcare.

Brexit: The big numbers you need to know

The domino effect?

A British vote to leave the EU could be the start of turbulent times for Europe. The EU is grappling with the world's worst refugee crisis in 70 years, and populist parties are gaining strength. The economy remains weak and unemployment high.

Support for the EU is falling sharply. A Pew Research Center study this week found that 47% of people in 10 member countries have an unfavorable opinion of the EU.

EU leaders are worried that if Britain decides to leave, other countries could follow. That could lead to a gradual unraveling of the EU, with huge consequences for the global economy, security and stability.

A more immediate threat is the risk that the United Kingdom could break apart. Leaders of the Scottish National Party have said they would seek a new referendum on Scotland's independence if Britain votes to leave the EU.

Scots are expected to vote in favor of keeping the U.K. in the EU.",2016-06-09 08:51:41
21,"Underwater volcanoes create massive carbon dioxide buildups in the lake - when the giant ""bubble"" is burst by an earthquake or a storm, the gas kills neighboring life. ",http://www.ozy.com/flashback/exploding-killer-lakes/65346,"A giant cloud of carbon dioxide bubbled up from Lake Nyos in northwestern Cameroon near the border of Nigeria on August 21, 1986, flowing into the valley below. It stripped the air of oxygen, suffocating 1,746 villagers and 3,000 animals to death.

This may sound like a scary movie plot, but for the thousands affected, it was a very real nightmare. A hydrovolcanic eruption 400 years earlier created a crater in the lake, where massive amounts of carbon dioxide built up over the centuries. Volcanic rumblings continued miles below the surface, with gas seeping into the groundwater to create “CO 2 -charged soda springs” that bled into the lake, says Dr. George Kling, a biologist at the University of Michigan.

When that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke.

The problem with CO 2 is that it builds up, “like in a soda bottle,” Kling says. No one can see the pressure building as long as the cap — in this case, the weight of the water — stays put and forces the gas to dissolve or be submerged. But when that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke, with bubbles rising to the surface and a giant burst of CO 2 escaping into the atmosphere.

Triggering the pressure’s release can be as simple as heavy rain or an earthquake. In Nyos, some boulders and dirt were the likely culprits, and Kling says he found evidence of a “very large and recent landslide” when he visited after the disaster. Dr. Njilah Isaac Konfor, a disaster-management and groundwater expert at the University of Yaounde in Cameroon, says there were reports of a week of rain before the event.

Luckily, there are just three known lakes worldwide with these properties, and only two of these limnic eruptions have occurred in recorded history. The first was a much smaller explosion at Lake Monoun, also in Cameroon, that killed 37. It took place two years earlier, almost to the day, just 19 miles away from Lake Nyos. Volcanologists and engineers, Kling says, have been working to eliminate the CO 2 risk there ever since via six-inch pipes that pump out the gas.

While “unlikely,” according to Dr. Greg Tanyileke of the Cameroonian Institute for Geological and Mining Research and the chief government scientist working on the lake, Lake Nyos could suffer another deadly eruption. Warding off such a calamity is an ongoing process, he says. Kling adds that, despite efforts to warn locals and help them make “informed choices,” many have returned to their homes and farmland because the soil there is so fertile, and farming is critical to their rural existence.

But CO 2 isn’t the only problem. There’s also a rickety natural dam made of volcanic ash and rock at one part of the crater. If it collapses, the top 130 feet of the lake could come crashing down, causing a flood that “would reach Nigeria” and endanger 5,000 people, Kling says. Even worse, this could cause another imbalance in the lake and possibly unleash any remaining carbon dioxide still suppressed at the bottom. This “double-whammy threat,” as Kling calls it, is being addressed by an expensive but essential dam-strengthening project that is nearing completion.



Even if Cameroon’s lakes are no longer a threat, scientists have their eyes on a far bigger lake in Central Africa with similar attributes. Lake Kivu, which lies on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, is 1,600 times larger than Nyos and contains 1,000 times more gas. It also sits on the Albertine Rift, where it is enduring increasing volcanic activity. This, combined with the fact that it has gas levels high enough to kill two million people along its shores if there’s a limnic eruption, makes it what Kling calls the “largest ticking time bomb in the world.”

And scientists haven’t settled on what can be done to avert the danger. The lake is so big that the methods used to degas Cameroon’s bodies of water simply won’t work. Instead, the Rwandan government is trying to prevent a disaster and capitalize on the natural gas — the fifth largest methane deposit in the world — by carefully harvesting the deposits for electricity. But until this project is done on a larger scale, another disaster like the one at Nyos remains possible.",2016-06-08 13:06:07

It is, frankly, terrifying to be a woman in El Salvador. The staunchly Catholic country of six million on the Pacific coast of the Central American isthmus is one of the most machista and patriarchal in the region.

Systematically beaten, raped, and killed in a country that has rarely held their aggressors accountable, women have become even more vulnerable since a government-brokered truce between the country’s two main gangs collapsed in 2014, experts and activists say. In 2012, when the truce was signed, homicides dropped by 60% from the previous year, but last year they shot up past pre-truce levels: There were 6,653 homicides — an average of 18 per week, or 115 for every 100,000 people.

This violence has spilled from the street into people's homes. “Gang members are at the center of families,” said Silvia Juárez, of the Organization of Salvadoran Women for Peace, or ORMUSA, a nonprofit. “The violence that women in El Salvador face is more lethal now.”

Femicides, or the killing of women because of their gender, have been on the rise in recent years. In 2014, there were 183 cases of femicide, up from 98 the previous year, though the numbers are believed to be significantly underreported. But it’s not just femicides: The rate at which women are being killed is rising faster than men. Last year, women made up 8.6% of all homicides, up from 7.5% the previous year, according to the Institute of Legal Medicine.

Despite this, there are few resources available for women who suffer domestic violence. The Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women, a government agency, has just one overnight shelter for victims of domestic violence, making it impossible for most women to reach.

In recent years, however, a glimmer of hope has emerged in the figure of the former first lady, Vanda Pignato. She has led a campaign to bring women's rights into the mainstream, and has built six centers — known as Ciudad Mujer (or Women's City) — around the country, offering women a place where they can seek help. And most importantly, they can do so anonymously — essential in a country where speaking out against your male abusers can be fatal.",2016-06-06 13:59:22
24,Oregano. ,http://grist.org/food/this-herb-could-be-the-secret-to-curbing-cows-climate-changing-burps/,"Oregano may seem like an unlikely ingredient in the fight against climate change. But this modest herb could make cows’ methane-heavy belches — a big contributor to the warming of our planet — a little less potent.

Oregano’s essential oil contains carvacrol, an antimicrobial that kills off some of the methane-producing bacteria in the cow’s rumen. Danish researchers who are investigating oregano’s methane-suppressing abilities hope that it could reduce cows’ methane emissions by a quarter. Nearly 15 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to livestock, and 65 percent of that total comes from raising beef and dairy cattle.

NPR points out that oregano oil isn’t the only solution to cutting down cows’ ballooning emissions. Scientists have explored unpronounceable alternatives like 3-nitrooxypopanal, a methane-inhibiting chemical. But those may not be compatible with organic guidelines, and many of the people who care about cows’ methane emissions are the same ones who buy organic milk.

We could just eat less dairy and beef. But while some Americans are starting to shift away from meat, that change may not happen soon enough. It might behoove us to get our cows chewing oregano cud, since that could be one small solution we could implement fast.",2016-06-02 15:30:00

For more than 15 years, Savage's doctors doled out the same advice: You need to stop gaining weight. When Savage replied that she had tried watching her diet and exercising, only to pack on more pounds, it was clear they simply didn't believe her. Her family was equally skeptical.

""I would eat like my sister, and I would gain weight but she wouldn't,"" recalled Savage, a civil engineer who lives in Montgomery County and turns 31 next month.

Savage's inexorable weight gain, which began in middle school and resulted in obesity, was not her only problem: For years, she also struggled with eruptions of painful acne and facial hair. ""These things made me feel ugly,"" she said.

Last year, after Savage had trouble getting pregnant, an inability she suspected was linked to her irregular periods, she consulted a new obstetrician/gynecologist. The doctor suggested that Savage's constellation of problems might have a single cause. But it took a second OB/GYN to conduct the proper tests, which led to a definitive diagnosis of a common -- and consequential -- disorder.

""It's frustrating to me that so many doctors"" didn't think of this, she said. ""If I'd known, I would have made changes years ago.""

From the time she was 12, Savage recalled, her inability to lose weight became one of the defining elements of her life. And because she is short -- 5-foot-3 -- extra pounds were particularly noticeable. Her family's comparisons with her older, thinner sister rankled.

At her mother's suggestion, Savage joined a gym, but that didn't help her lose more than a few pounds.

Savage said she was too intimidated to ask her doctors why her weight didn't budge much, even when she faithfully followed a diet and worked out.

Nor did she mention the other problems that plagued her. ""The facial hair thing was embarrassing, so I didn't want to talk about it,"" she recalled. ""Same with the acne. I felt so sensitive about it.""

Savage wasn't sure what to make of her irregular menstrual periods, but doctors did not seem concerned. At times she went three months without a period; at other times they lasted for two weeks. She managed to lose a little weight in college, but her acne and other problems persisted.

✕ What if men had periods?

In her early 20s, Savage said, her gynecologist chided her about how heavy she was; every year, she seemed to gain 10 pounds. ""I explained that I had tried diet and exercise, but he said I was not trying hard enough,"" Savage recalled.

To regulate her menstrual cycle and tame her acne, the doctor prescribed oral contraceptives, which helped clear her skin and made her periods somewhat less irregular.

When she got married in 2010, Savage and her husband joined a popular weight-loss program to see whether they could motivate each other.

Savage said she lost only about eight pounds after several months, while her husband, who followed the same diet, had no trouble shedding much more weight.

""It was very frustrating,"" she recalled. ""I was serious about following the rules, but it didn't pay off. I kind of gave up.""

By early 2015, she was desperate. She had stopped taking the pill nearly a year earlier, in hopes of getting pregnant; without it, her acne had roared back and her facial-hair problem had worsened. Savage was at her heaviest weight -- about 240 pounds -- and her family doctor warned that her cholesterol, at 210 mg/dL, was too high.

In March, she switched gynecologists. Her new doctor zeroed in on her irregular periods and her weight and asked Savage whether she had heard of a metabolic disorder called polycystic ovarian (or ovary) syndrome.

Savage replied that a friend in college had been diagnosed with PCOS. She was surprised when the doctor responded that she suspected Savage might have it, too.

An explanation at last

PCOS is a common hormonal imbalance that often begins in puberty and affects as many as 10 percent of women. Its cause is unknown, but heredity appears to play a role: Women whose mothers or sisters have the disorder are at higher risk. Many women with PCOS have enlarged ovaries containing fluid-filled cysts that produce excess androgens -- male sex hormones, which interfere with ovulation. Other signs of PCOS include irregular, absent or prolonged periods, acne and excess facial and body hair, a condition known as hirsutism.

Because it also disrupts the regulation of insulin, many women with PCOS are overweight or obese. The disorder, which can be controlled but not cured, also increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart attack.

The gynecologist told Savage that she also suffered from PCOS. When Savage asked whether it was possible to test for the disorder, she said that the gynecologist told her, erroneously, that there were no tests. The best way to treat the problem was to lose weight, the doctor advised. And, the gynecologist added, she held weight-loss seminars in her office and urged Savage to sign up.

Savage declined. Two weeks later, she consulted a third OB/GYN, Neil Horlick, who practices in Montgomery and Frederick counties.

Horlick, after taking her history and performing an exam, said he suspected she had PCOS. When Savage told him she had been told there was no test for it, he assured her that testing was available and that he would order it.

Because abnormalities of the thyroid or adrenal glands can cause similar symptoms, those must be ruled out first. PCOS is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion, made on the basis of blood tests, a patient's symptoms and an ultrasound of the ovaries.

""We generally look for two out of three criteria for PCOS,"" Horlick said. These include a history of irregular or absent periods, elevated levels of male hormones, particularly testosterone, and the presence of ovarian cysts. In Savage's case, an ultrasound showed no cysts, but she did have an elevated testosterone level.

Horlick said he was surprised that Savage's condition went undiagnosed for so long. ""PCOS is always on our radar"" when a patient with irregular periods complains of weight gain and hirsutism, Horlick said.

He told Savage that her best chance of getting pregnant involved losing weight. Horlick prescribed metformin, a diabetes drug that can promote weight loss. Metformin is commonly given to PCOS patients and may help promote ovulation as well.

Savage decided to take a new approach to food. She began following a paleo diet, which emphasizes meat, vegetables, nuts and fruit, and drastically reduces the intake of carbohydrates, sugar and processed foods.

The first month, she said, she was elated to discover that she had lost 15 pounds; between April and September, she shed 50 pounds and her cholesterol dropped 20 points. Her acne also improved, her level of testosterone dropped, and her menstrual cycle became more regular.

Savage said she asked relatives whether anyone else had been diagnosed with PCOS. ""My parents had never heard of it,"" she said.

In October 2015, she and her husband were elated to learn that she was pregnant with identical twin boys. Savage spent six weeks hospitalized at Maryland's Shady Grove Medical Center under close observation, because her twins have a rare condition in which they share a single amniotic sac and placenta, a condition unrelated to PCOS. The babies were born April 22.

Savage said she hopes that her experience will spare other women from ""struggling for years the way I did.""

""This isn't a bizarre disorder,"" she said. ""It shouldn't take [this many] doctors to find out, when I have a textbook case.""

26,"Actual suggestions from article: Donate it, throw in the ocean, bake world's largest pizza, make cheese sculptures, shoot into the sun, put on the moon. ",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/17/cheese-america-surplus-donation,"As if we didn’t already have enough to worry about, what with the never-ending wars, economic inequality, prejudice, and the latest Drake album being very underwhelming to be perfectly honest, now I find out we have too much cheese.

According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, the United States has an overwhelming surplus of cheese, enough to equal three extra pounds of the stuff for every person in the country. If that’s really the case, then I eagerly await my share of this glorious bounty. Just ship it over in some dry ice, Obama. This hot tub I just installed in my back yard will make an excellent fondue pot.

The unfortunate dark side of this situation is that the overproduction of cheese by dairy farmers has tanked the price of their number one product, costing the industry millions of dollars in lost revenue. Michigan dairy farmer Carla Wardin told the Journal that her colleagues plan to deal with the situation by “do[ing] the same thing … you milk more cows”.

If dairy farmers refuse to stop making cheese, I suppose the only solution to this problem is to quickly, efficiently dispose of the cheese surplus. How are we going to do that? Glad you asked, because I have a few brilliant solutions. In fact, these are so clever that you might as well start calling me the Elon Musk of dairy products:

Donate the cheese to the hungry

According to the United Nations World Food Programme, 795 million people on the planet don’t have enough food to lead a healthy life. That’s about two and a half times the population of the US, but there’s enough surplus cheese here to give each of those hungry people 1.5 pounds. Even though cheese is not particularly healthy, and some people are lactose intolerant, some cheese is still better than no cheese, which also happens to be my rule at cocktail parties during the passed appetizer period.

All the extra cheese would be gone, dairy farmers could milk cows as much as they pleased, the price of cheese would soar, and the world’s starving masses would be able to enjoy a spot of brie that pairs excellently with a glass of pinot noir. There are no losers here.



Of course, that’s not what will happen. Here are scenarios far more likely than an act of kindness by the dairy industry:

Dump the cheese in the ocean

There’s already an island of trash in the middle of the Pacific Ocean the size of the state of Texas that no one seems to be bothered by, though there’s a decent chance that if Donald Trump finds out about it, he’ll promise to drop a nuke on it.

Besides the horrific effect a pile of garbage has on our marine ecosystem, it’s also not at all edible. You can’t eat an island of refuse, but you certainly can eat a large, floating mound of cheese. It’ll be a great place for cruise ships to stop for a cheesy photo opp. Plus, you can take a hunk of it home, like the Berlin Wall – at least until the whole thing melts and kills all the fish. But hey, think about what that will do to the price of fish! Cash those checks now, folks.

Bake the world’s largest pizza

We haven’t sent an astronaut to the moon in decades. Infrastructure projects that used to thrill the human imagination are now seen as major inconveniences at best, and at worst, blatant government overreach. New skyscraper height records are met with the sort of shrug usually reserved for the newest Katherine Heigl movie.

It’s time to inspire this great nation again. The only thing I can think of that really excites Americans is pizza. Every time I’ve seen a mega-pizza delivered to a home or a place of business, people gather around and poke at it with a stick like the monkeys from the beginning of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Pizza is the real final frontier, so let’s take that cheese and bake the largest pizza of all time.

The Guinness Book of World Records states that the biggest pie of all time was baked in Italy in December of 2012 by a man named Dovilio Nardi. It was 1,261.5 square meters – 13,580ft to us Yanks. That this pizza holds the record is shameful.

First of all, it’s gluten-free. Second, there’s no pepperoni, no mushrooms and no buffalo chicken – no toppings at all. But the most heinous crime is that the crust is not stuffed. If America made a giant pizza, you’d better believe that we would stuff the hell out of that crust. There’d be cheese, bacon, sausage, ranch dressing and if you’re lucky, a 2016 Chevy Malibu free to whomever is able to eat their way to it first.

Erect cheese sculptures in every city

If our current reevaluation of former presidents like Woodrow Wilson and Andrew Jackson are any indication, it is inevitable that every great American we revere now will eventually be found out as a murderer, a sadist or a racist. Why bother going through the tedious process of removing their names from buildings, taking them off currency or tearing down their statues? Why not just henceforth make each monument out of cheese? That way, they eventually rot and we have to toss them in a dumpster to get rid of the awful, awful smell of old gruyere. By the time the revelations of anti-social behavior come out, the cheese monument will be long gone.

Shoot it all into the sun with a rocket

This would be similar to the scene in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, when Superman collects all the nuclear weapons on the planet and hurls them into the sun to avert a global holocaust. Except it’s cheese.

Put it on the moon

In the same vein as the Superman IV solution, I propose we leave the cheese on the moon. It will probably be just fine sitting up there with no oxygen-based microorganisms to rot it. Remember how people once thought the moon was made of cheese? Well, now it will be. A dream no longer deferred.

Whatever we do, though, let’s make sure we don’t give it all away to someone who needs it. That would be un-American.",2016-06-02 14:00:00

The girl’s mother described how jihadi fighters had set fire to the family home in Mosul, northern Iraq, after they failed to pay a religious tax on time.

The tax, known as the Jaziya, is imposed on all non-Muslims in Isis controlled territories and is calculated according to their estimated net worth.

The unnamed mother described how “foreign” Isis fighters had arrived at her door and said she had two choices, either “you are to leave now or you are to pay the Jaziya"".

Human rights advocate, Jacqueline Issac, said the mother told them she would pay, but asked for a “few seconds” as her daughter was in the shower.

The jihadis reportedly refused to wait and lit the house with a torch immediately.

✕ Swedish teenager describes Isis experience

Both the mother and her daughter managed to escape the burning house, but the child died from her fourth degree burns a few hours later.

Ms Issac told the Daily Express: “The daughter had fourth degree burns and the mother took her daughter, scrambling, doing anything to save her.

“She rushed her to the hospital and her daughter died in her arms.

“The last thing her daughter said was: ‘Forgive them’.”

Last week, a leading cleric in Baghdad said the country’s ancient Christian population could disappear within five years because of the Isis threat.

Father Martin Hermis Dawood said he used to advise members of his congregation who were contemplating fleeing the country to stay strong, but since the emergence of the terror group two years ago he had told them to go.

Iraqi Christian leaders estimate the total number of Chaldean Catholics, Syrian Orthodox and members of the eastern Assyrian church - the main denominations in the country - has declined from 1.3 million people 20 years ago to just 400,000 today, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Father Dawood said: “We are in the middle, we have seen it. When newspapers published cartoons about the Prophet Mohammed, it was in Europe, but gangs tried to assault Christians here. Something happened in Belgium or in Holland, I paid here.

“We know very well that not every Muslim here is a terrorist, but there is a culture rising, not only here in Iraq, but in the Middle East. There’s a struggle happening in the whole world and we will be burned in this fire in the future.”",2016-06-02 13:30:00

Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic.

Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said.

Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones.

Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food?

The answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward. Here, we explore this hotly contested issue.

What the heck does organic mean anyway?

Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed.

“By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,” Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email.

When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says “100 percent organic” indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. “Organic,” on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while “made with organic ingredients” is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients.

There’s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an “excuse to charge more.”

Indeed, there’s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are.

Still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not.

A 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and “substantially higher” levels of antioxidants.

So, what does this mean for human health?

According to the Environmental Working Group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the USDA in 2014 contained pesticide residues. In some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled.

Pesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's to cancer and birth defects.

The jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health.

In the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency.

“We’re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis,” said Michael Crupain, the director of Consumer Reports’ Food Safety and Sustainability Center, in an earlier post. “It’s not realistic to expect we wouldn’t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal. We just don’t know enough about the health effects.”

Some organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects.

When it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, there's also conflicting data.

The 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods. A meta-analysis published two years later in the British Journal of Nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds.

A recent study, published in February, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids.

“Omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function,” wrote study co-author Chris Seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the U.K.’s Newcastle University. “But getting enough in our diet is difficult. Our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients.”

As for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut.

The Centers for Disease Control notes that ""[s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health"" because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop. So choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue.

Other ways of measuring “worth”:

When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth’s well-being, too.

“When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,” she told HuffPost. “Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me.”

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health.

But organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit.

Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation.

Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large.

“Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,” he said. “It’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly.”

According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers.

“Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,” the nonprofit writes.

Many organic farms are small operations, though ""big organic"" farms do exist as well. If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you're often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce.

Organic on a budget

Regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just “buy organic to the extent you can, when you can.”

And there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply):

1. Prioritize your purchases.

“It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,” advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University’s Pancreas Center, in a blog post.

She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible.

“Some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,” she said.

Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. “The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,” said Lu.

For produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable.

“Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,” said Gerszberg.

The Environmental Working Group's “Dirty Dozen” and “Clean Fifteen” lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The “clean” list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower.

2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce.

Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative.

“The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor,” writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont. “Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities.”

Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient. It also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation.

It's estimated that the average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture. In contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less.

3. Buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too.

Many mainstream supermarkets, including Safeway, Target, Wal-Mart and H-E-B, carry organic store-brand options, while Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's sell organic foodstuffs in bulk. Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products.

4. Keep an eye out for sales and coupons. Sites like All Natural Savings and Organic Deals can help customers surface organic food deals.

5. Grow your own food. It might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isn't as difficult as it sounds. It just requires a bit of effort and patience. Good Housekeeping has some tips on how to start your own organic garden. Live in a small apartment? The Urban Organic Gardener website's got you covered.

The bottom line

So is buying organic worth it? Depending on your priorities, it might be. Ultimately, many experts agree that eating a balanced diet, while remaining conscientious about how your food choices impact the health of the planet and farming communities, is key.

30,Media and Political elites. ,http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/05/31/obama_s_new_overtime_regulations_draw_complaints_from_media_activists.html,"Noam Scheiber at the New York Times posted a fantastic piece Monday about a surprising source of opposition to the Obama administration’s new overtime regulations: media and political elites.

As of Dec. 1, the law will require employers to pay the vast majority of salaried employees earning less than $47,476 annually overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours a week, double the current standard. As Vice President Joe Biden said when he announced the new regulations earlier this month, “If you work overtime, you should actually get paid for working overtime.”

The administration estimates this will raise the pay of more than 4 million workers by $12 billion over the next decade. And if an employer doesn’t want to pay the bill? Well, employees gain free time.

Sounds great, right?

Not, apparently, if you are a New York publishing insider. “You want to bump into the boss at 8 o’clock at night,” Dan Reynolds, the chief executive of Workman Publishing and a man otherwise known as, uh, the boss, told Scheiber.

Or a political activist.

In a statement released shortly after the rules were announced, Andre Delattre, the executive director of the United States Public Interest Research Group, better known as US PIRG, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization, whined, “A person of means—in service of a cause to which they feel deeply committed—can volunteer to work for our organization for free for as many hours as they wish, but a person of lesser means—who is no less committed to the work we do—cannot agree to work for our organization for less than $47,476 without having their work hours strictly limited in order to keep our costs affordable.”

What’s going on here?

When the Obama administration first announced their intention to reform the overtime regulations two years ago, some of the most vehement protest came from employers of low-wage workers, like the fast food industry. And little wonder.

While hourly workers are almost always eligible for overtime pay, salaried workers are not—unless, that is, they earn less than the overtime threshold. When that amount was set at the current $23,660, there was an easy enough dodge. Give someone a managerial or professional title, and you were all but home free. While some companies—Hi, Chipotle!—have been sued by current and former employees who allege that their highfalutin’ job descriptions did not match the reality of their less than impressive responsibilities, it seems all but certain the vast majority got away with the practice.

The new rules are, of course, an attempt to do away with this rather disgraceful behavior. But raising the issue brought another uncomfortable truth to light. Employers in lower-prestige professions like fast food are not the only ones treating employees unfairly. Any number of higher-end, more prestigious industries were relying on the business model, too. Scheiber calls it “The Devil Wears Prada economy,” after the famed Lauren Weisberger novel, widely thought to be about her time working for Vogue’s Anna Wintour.

This is, of course, something of an established path for career advancement. You work long hours at your intro job—like, say, editorial assistant, or political canvasser, or would-be Hollywood agent—and try to take on extra duties as well, in the hopes the boss will notice you and promote you up.

This model has its supporters, including Slate’s Jordan Weissman, who wrote last year, “while overtime functions pretty well when it’s used to discourage companies from working vulnerable employees in low-skill positions to the bone, it’s not necessarily appropriate in creative industries where educated young people are out to make a name for themselves and margins are thin.”

However, an argument could be made that by enabling this sort of behavior at the more prestigious ends of the labor market, we are making the practice more acceptable for everyone by normalizing it.

Americans, somewhat famously, are a nation of workaholics. In 2014, a Gallup survey found that the average American claimed to be putting in 47 hours a week on the job. As I pointed out last year, most of us seem to think that’s proper, or at least acceptable. We idealize Silicon Valley, where outsize workweeks are the norm.

Advertisement

Yet this sort of time on the job is not exactly effective. Academic studies show that work performance deteriorates rapidly after someone puts in more than 50 hours a week. In fact, the drop-off point might even come after significantly fewer hours on the job. An Australian survey recently found that for people over the age of 40, performance began to decline after a mere 25 hours a week.

Moreover, it’s easy to suspect that the bosses claiming that their underlings are desperate to work long hours for low pay are telling themselves what they want to hear.

Advertisement

A quick tour of Glass Door, a site for job listings and career advice, makes it clear that many of US PIRG’s employees and former employees have a different take. “Take better care of your employees. Invest in them. Give them the financial resources to have a live outside of work,” one wrote the week after the new regulations were announced. “With such a low pay and laborious workload, it’s hard for people to make it a long-term job,” a former canvasser claimed. “Very long hours, high turnover, terrible work/life balance - employees are expected to devote almost all their time to their jobs (80+ hours a week),” wrote a third.

Liberals like to point fingers when people like presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims, “Wages are too high,” because, as he put it a Republican debate last November, “People have to go out, they have to work really hard and they have to get into that upper stratum.” But as the US PIRG example reveals, it turned out they—OK, we—have something of a problem of our own.

The truth is this: Underpaid overwork is underpaid overwork, and it shouldn’t matter if you are serving burritos at Chipotle, making Anna Wintour’s manicure appointments, or lobbying for political change. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. That means getting paid for every hour spent on the job, not to mention getting a break from it.",2016-06-01 20:56:00
31,She's Married. ,http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-harry-cant-keep-away-7955440,"The charismatic Prince Charming has been spotted with Sergeant Elizabeth Marks on numerous occasions - setting social media alight

Flirty Prince Harry can't keep away from glamorous US soldier at Invictus Games - there's just one problem

Prince Harry looks like he's smitten with US soldier Sergeant Elizabeth Marks - meeting her several times at his Invictus Games.

The flirtatious meetings between the two have set social media alight as the pair spent a number of hours together.

They were pictured together after the 25-year-old came first in the 100 metre freestyle with the Prince, 31, seemingly mesmerised by her leg-length tattoo.

They then shared a moving moment when Sergeant Marks gave Harry back the medal - one of four golds she won in the pool - asking him instead to deliver it to doctors and nurses at the British hospital that saved her life.

Sergeant Marks clearly found Harry hilarious as they were seen joking and laughing together as he tried on one of her US team tops.

“As soon as they met they just hit it off,” said a spectator.

“Sergeant Marks is extremely attractive and Harry clearly took a little bit of a shine to her after all what she has achieved.

“But when she asked for her medal to be given to doctors and nurses who saved her life back home he, like all of us, was bowled over.”

The next day they met up again with a kiss on the cheek as they were both spectating at the wheelchair rugby tournament.

Two years ago on the eve of competing in the first Invictus Games in London, Sgt Marks fell gravely ill when she collapsed with a lung condition.

Her trouble began on the flight over to the UK when she began losing her voice.

Initially she thought it was due to the amount of interviews she had done but by the time the plane landed in London, she couldn’t breathe and was taken to the Royal London Hospital and admitted for what they believed was pneumonia.

A specialist team from Papworth Hospital was brought in who placed her in an induced coma.

Speaking about her ordeal Sgt Marks said: “I landed in London and became very ill very rapidly, I was in hospital in London and went into respiratory distress syndrome, they shipped a team down from Papworth who put me on to ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] life support and that ultimately saved my life.

“And when they did so I was on it for 10 days and ended up waking in an army hospital in Germany having no idea what had happened.

“But they absolutely saved my life and I can’t thank the UK enough for having that kind of medical support and taking such good care of me.""

Sgt Marks joined the US army when she was 17 years old.

She suffered debilitating hip injuries in Iraq in 2010 that left her with no feeling in her left leg.

The Army evacuated her and flew her to Brooke Army Medical Centre in San Antonio, Texas, where she began a gruelling recovery.

She underwent three surgeries to restructure her hips and regain enough mobility to walk.

Doctors never determined what caused the illness and although the ECMO saved her life it left her with some neurological impairment.

The sergeant took to the pool in her bid ongoing bid to be cleared for duty to continue as an active soldier.

Arizona-born Sgt Marks now hopes to repeat her success at the Invictus Games at Rio’s Paralympics in September.

She is ranked number one in the world in the 100-meter breaststroke with a time of 1:30.44, according to the International Paralympic Committee.

Any hopes Prince Harry’s fans had however of His Royal Highness getting to know Sgt Marks have been dashed as it emerged she is “happily married”.",2016-06-01 18:43:27
32,Women. ,http://elitedaily.com/envision/which-demographic-buys-gas-guzzling-suvs-the-most/1508536/,"You know those big SUVs that rush by you on the highway with no regard for human life? Most of them are purchased by one particular demographic.

According to CarBuzz, SUV sales are skyrocketing as more fuel-efficient sport utility vehicles are introduced to the once struggling marketing. But who's buying them the most? You'll NEVER guess...

Believe it or not, women are actually purchasing more SUVs than men, according to recent data and research by Michigan-based firm MartizCX.

Mainstream small SUV sales to women increased by nearly 34 percent compared to a 22 percent increase in mainstream small SUV sales to men between 2010 and 2015. Within the women purchasing SUVs, 40 percent are single and unmarried.

Premium small SUV sales to women soared by 177 percent over the same 5 years.

But why?

TIME links the increased female-dominant SUV sales to a rise in income and educational attainment and a drop in marriages and child-bearing.

MartizCX reveals,

There's a group of single, professional females out there that need vehicles, and you need to be attentive to them.

It looks like single, professional females gravitate more toward practical, fuel-efficient SUVs rather than sports coupes and luxury sedans.

So far, the top five best-selling SUVs in 2016 are: Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Ford Explorer, and the Nissan Rogue respectively.

33,It will be like Mum and Dad divorcing but on a massive scale. ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/31/what-happens-next-if-britain-votes-to-leave-the-eu,"The first hours

By the early hours of Friday 24 June, it will be clear if the UK has defied the experts and pollsters by voting to leave the European Union.

If that happens, a shattered David Cameron, his leadership already a matter of speculation, will have no option but to make a statement outside 10 Downing Street saying he will respect the mandate of the British people. The Treasury, Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) will move quickly to roll out well-hidden battle plans to prevent market chaos.

A shocked European political class will find itself grappling with an unprecedented, messy and sprawling divorce that could rumble on for years.

The EU will respond as it does to any crisis, and convene an emergency summit, probably as early as the weekend.

As the morning unfolds it will quickly become clear that although the basic Brexit procedures are set down in law with some clarity, the politics, timeframe and potentially explosive brinkmanship will bring deep uncertainty and new disputes between the Brexiters and Europe.

EU commission officials, for instance, claim the UK will rapidly discover it has put itself in the role of supplicant, and they even talk of throwing the country out on its ear. Jean-Claude Juncker has already warned the UK should remember that deserters are not greeted with open arms.

“It is in our interest to do the divorce as quickly as possible. There’s no appetite for negotiating new terms in the first two years,” one source says.



Others, mainly in the leave campaign, contend that a more stately, considered pace to the divorce is possible. They deny the EU holds all the cards in shaping a new relationship between an independent UK and a jilted Europe.

The weekend (24-26 June)

The high watermark of summer: as the Glastonbury faithful turn their attention to the headliners, and football fans gear up for the knockout phases of the European championships, officials in London and Brussels will be weighing a very different knockout. Rapidly the discussion will move to the processes of Brexit, and the irreversibility of the decision. Only Greenland (on achieving self-rule) and Algeria (on gaining independence from France) have left the European bloc, and the only legal pathway out of the current EU is through article 50, inserted in the 2009 Lisbon treaty. This allows a country two years to negotiate the terms of its exit from the moment it notifies the EU of its intention to leave. A Brexit vote does not represent that formal notification. Those playing for time will argue that six weeks must be allowed for legal challenges to the referendum result, so at the very least it might be best to wait for the result to be immune from legal interference.

But once the notification is triggered, negotiations cannot extend beyond a two-year notice period, unless all remaining EU member states agree to such an extension. It would therefore take just one member state to insist the divorce must happen at the end of the two years. Arguably, and this will be contested, the UK could at some point in the two years reverse its decision to leave. If, for instance, the deal offered by the EU were very poor, nothing in the EU treaty would prevent the UK government going back to a largely pro-remain UK parliament to seek a second referendum.

Week one

The EU’s instinctive response to a UK Brexit vote will be one of self preservation. An emergency summit is likely to seek the equivalent of the “Draghi moment” when the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, announced he would do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. With markets in turmoil, and Eurosceptics across Europe emboldened, the European political class will want a joint declaration of a determination to continue, possibly as an even more integrated Europe.

Divisions will start to emerge. Countries with strong ties to the UK such as Malta, Cyprus and Poland may plead for caution. Slovakia, which will hold the presidency of the council in the second half of 2016, is reluctant to see the UK go. The inclination across Brussels will be to treat the UK harshly so Brexit cannot be presented to other sceptical states as a cost-free option. “It will be imperative to prevent the Brexit contagion gripping other countries,” says one EU official. The French and Germans, facing challenges from their own Eurosceptics in 2017 elections, will demand action. They will want to know what kind of future relations with Europe the UK proposes. At issue will be the UK access to the single market and the continuance of the free movement of labour.

Andrew Duff, a former Liberal Democrat MEP, who helped devise article 50, says: “The EU could not allow a seceding state to spin things out for too long. The clause puts most of the cards in the hands of those that stay in.”

By the end of the week, the UK may find itself excluded from some EU meetings as the remaining 27 decide how to structure the withdrawal negotiations, based on proposals from the executive commission.

Week two

Inside the UK, Cameron will either fall on his sword, prompting a leadership contest at a point of economic turmoil, or say he has a duty to negotiate an exit, perhaps staying on until the autumn.

He has said he would immediately trigger article 50 because “the British people would rightly expect that to start straight away”. George Osborne has said that “this is crucially important, the one way the European Union itself has a legal basis to negotiate our exit is to trigger article 50. Article 50 would be triggered immediately and that process would begin.” The trigger would be pulled with a fortnight, Osborne added.

However, Dominic Cummings, the campaign director for Vote Leave, says an immediate move to set article 50 in motion would be “mad and like putting a gun into your mouth and pulling the trigger”.

Meanwhile, Michael Gove claims the remarks by Cameron and Osborne need to be filtered through the prism of the referendum campaign. It is in the interests of Cameron and the commission to play up the risk of a Brexit vote.

In reality, once defeated in the referendum the political authority of the Cameron-Osborne axis will have been blown away. The mantle will have passed to Gove, and to Boris Johnson. Both men have said there is no need to rush to the exit door.

The next few weeks

The shell-shocked 450-strong majority for remain in the House of Commons will have gathered its forces. A consensus will form that it would be best for all sides to take their time.

From Cummings’ point of view, time will be needed over the summer for the EU to admit it is in its self-interest to retain a close trading relationship with the UK. At play will be the UK’s continued membership of the single market, and free movement of EU citizens.

But Agata Gostyńska-Jakubowska of the pro-EU Centre for European Reform says delaying for too long “might be unacceptable for the EU partners”, further eroding goodwill and weakening their negotiating hand. The UK, by extending the agony, would be an unwanted participant in EU meetings.

So politically Britain will not be able to delay in perpetuity, and by the autumn the pressure for an article 50 notification will be overwhelming.

Autumn 2016

Once the article 50 trigger is pulled, the EU council of ministers, now certain that Brexit is happening, will by qualified majority voting agree a negotiation mandate, in the form of directives to the commission.

The full scale of the task facing Whitehall will become clear. The UK will have to renegotiate 80,000 pages of EU agreements, deciding those to be kept in UK law and those to jettison. British officials have said privately that nobody knows how long this would take, but some ministers say it would clog up parliament for years. Greenland, with a population of 55,000, took two years to negotiate its exit.

Brexiters often point to farming or fisheries as relatively easy to negotiate, yet 60% of UK food and drink exports go to the EU and 60% of fish. The EU and Norway spend four months negotiating a fisheries deal for 40 stocks. Yet EU-UK fisheries negotiations would have to contend with 140 stocks.

A senior UK official said: “The honest answer is nobody knows how long this would take and we would all be making it up.”

Winter 2016

One scenario is that the first set of negotiations surrounding withdrawal will be completed inside two years. They will cover issues such as residual EU budget payments to and from Britain, the acquired rights of UK citizens in Europe and the reciprocal rights of EU citizens in the UK, the pensions of British EU civil servants and relocation of EU agencies based in the UK.

However, longer-term issues such as future trade relations, including tariffs, are likely to be dealt with separately.

2017

The negotiations will be grinding on, and the Brexit campaign may find some of its optimism about a new trade deal was unfounded. Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, has claimed “we will be able to trade with the single market on free-trade terms, without paying into the system or accepting freedom of movement”. He insists that access will be tariff-free, and that the UK is uniquely well placed to strike such a deal thanks to its large trade deficit with major EU countries. Elliott has reasoned: “I cannot imagine, the day after Britain votes to leave, Angela Merkel allowing a situation where the British markets were cut off for BMW or any of the other companies. Ditto the French farmers, the Italian fashion companies and what have you.”

Others say this is overly optimistic. Cameron, for instance, has pointed out that 44% of UK exports go to the European Union, while just 8% of what the EU exports goes the other way. In short, he says, Britain is the one in greatest need of an agreement.

Striking a trade deal on services, especially the critical financial services, will be difficult as France and Ireland eye a chance to end the dominance of the City of London, and grab business. Equally UK negotiators will find it hard to get countries such as China interested in negotiating a separate trade deal with the UK, as opposed to the whole EU.

As all this emerges from the Brussels negotiations, the UK parliament may assert itself and demand a closer relationship with the EU than the one envisaged by Brexiters. One model is offered by Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area. Another is Switzerland’s relationship with the EU – in effect a series of bilateral treaties.

MPs will start to use the Commons to rein in Gove and Johnson. If no trade deal is struck they will become increasingly worried as the UK will have no choice but to trade with the rest of Europe under World Trade Organisation rules.

The House of Commons foreign affairs committee recently spelled out the implication of this: “If no deal could be concluded within the two-year notice period, the UK would move to standard WTO relationship terms and would then need to decide which of the 6,987 directly applicable EU regulations would need to be replaced by UK law.”

Boris Johnson - going into bat for Britain? Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA

The French and German elections will be over. Eurosceptic parties will possibly have suffered because of the evident difficulties the UK is experiencing in its negotiations. The drawbacks of life outside the EU will have been clear to French and German voters.

Let’s imagine one far from implausible outcome. The EU has played hardball with the UK and the deadline for Brexit is imminent. Last-minute talks are due to start, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, insists he will bat for Britain through the night. With few bargaining chips at his disposal, he strikes a deal on the narrow terms of the UK exit but the future trading relationship is unclear. By default, Britain will cease to be a member of the European Union and will trade with Europe under WTO rules outside the single market, facing tariffs on exports.

This deal – such as it is – will need to be agreed by a qualified majority in the council of ministers. Any remaining UK allies in the council will be outvoted. Consent of both the European and UK parliaments will then be required, followed by ratification by member states. The UK, now outside the EU, will return to Brussels to reopen its trade talks.

34,Cancel the Paris Climate Plan. ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/05/27/donald-trump-just-made-an-extremely-important-promise-its-one-of-his-worst-yet/,"The near-term political consequences of this will — or should — be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely. I don’t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it’s likely Sanders will see it this way, too.

To get all the details on Trump’s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer’s piece. Trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue GOP agenda of “fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production.” More important, with some reporters wondering what Trump’s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: He is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we’re currently putting in place to deal with it.

Trump said that the current environmental challenges that the Obama administration is trying to tackle are “phony.” He added that he would “rescind” the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the U.S.’s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. He would withdraw the U.S. from participation in that global accord.

As I’ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a Republican president — even one as masterfully competent and strong as Trump — to roll back the Clean Power Plan and/or withdraw from the Paris climate deal. But it’s possible that Trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback.

This deepens the contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton. While Clinton would not be as ambitious as Sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that Clinton would preserve and implement the Clean Power Plan and the global climate accord, and Trump would seek to reverse them both.

Sanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face:

Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016

And:

As a father of four and a grandfather of seven, I care about leaving a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016

It’s true that Sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient. But Sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it — and the Clean Power Plan — are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Sanders knows that the Paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem. Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. What’s more, even if the Paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. The accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. Obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible.

It is often said that Sanders may not help to unify the party because he has “nothing to lose” from a Democratic loss. I think that is wrong — I believe Sanders when he says a Trump presidency is unthinkable. And at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor Sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement’s influence going forward. Trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by Sanders’ own lights, we all have to lose from a Trump presidency. My bet is Sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to Trump’s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative.

* DOWN TO THE WIRE IN CALIFORNIA: Politico reports that the Clinton campaign thinks it might eke out a win over Bernie Sanders in California, due to the latter’s strategic errors:

Story continues below advertisement

The biggest problem for Sanders has to do with independent voters….Those voters can vote in the Democratic primary, but to do so they must request a Democratic ballot….Educating those independent voters about the clunky process was part of a [previous Sanders campaign] field organizing strategy…But the campaign decided to go in a different direction, instead focusing its dwindling resources on television advertising.

The likely close outcome means the delegate math will remain unchanged, though a lot of people will make claims about what the “narrative” of a Clinton defeat there supposedly means.

* NEW EXPLANATION FOR HILLARY EMAIL SETUP: A former State Department official has offered a new explanation in a deposition as part of a lawsuit by a conservative group:

Lewis A. Lukens, a former State Department administrative official, said in a sworn deposition last week that after Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, he had proposed accommodating her by setting up a desktop computer in her office that would not be connected to the department’s system. That would have allowed her to send and receive email on a personal account….But that idea was abandoned, Mr. Lukens testified, after an aide to the secretary told him that Mrs. Clinton was “very comfortable checking her emails on a BlackBerry, but she’s not adept or not used to checking her emails on a desktop.”

Clinton is frustrated that she can’t move past the drip-drip-drip nature of this story, but that isn’t going to happen until the FBI releases its findings, and even then it will probably continue.

* TRUMP’S GROUND GAME IS ‘NONEXISTENT’: The Associated Press recently reported that the Trump campaign is ramping up its organization in 15 states. NBC News reports that’s nonsense:

Story continues below advertisement

On the ground, there are few signs the action of building a large campaign apparatus is underway. One Trump campaign source told NBC News that boasting to the AP of 15 state directors being deployed was a “piece ginned up to make it seem like we’re doing something when we’re not.”….“It’s either fluid or non-existent,” the source continued, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “I would lean towards the latter.”

The question now is whether the RNC can make up for it and build an operation for him.

* REPUBLICANS SCRAMBLE TO BUILD TRUMP A GROUND GAME: Related to the above, Politico reports:

The Republican National Committee is scrambling to respond to increasingly frantic concerns from state GOP officials that the party has not provided enough field organizers and will be badly outgunned by Democrats in battleground states. POLITICO surveyed nearly two dozen GOP chairmen, officials and operatives in key swing states who said the RNC hadn’t delivered on promises, putting in peril their ability to launch the robust voter-turnout operation needed in the general election.

But surely Trump’s candidacy is so “uncoventional” that none of this will matter.

* REPUBLICANS WORRY ABOUT TRUMP’S FINANCE OPERATION: David Drucker reports that Republicans are wondering whether Trump can build up a fundraising operation in time:

The problem is that fundraising networks don’t bring in hundreds of millions of dollars overnight….The RNC has had a very successful election cycle fundraising, bringing in $144.8 million thus far, with $17.4 million in the bank as of April 30. But the demands of running a presidential campaign, as charged to do by Trump, are going to require considerably more money, and fast. Republicans in down-ticket races wonder if there is going to be any cash left over to help them.

Maybe if Trump brashly promises a “world class” finance operation enough times, one will eventually materialize.

* TRUMP IS CONFIDENT HE’LL BROADEN THE MAP: On the campaign trail last night, Trump talked about how competitive he’ll be in states off limits to Republicans. Jenna Johnson summarizes his argument:

Story continues below advertisement

Which states will Trump target? California. Ohio, where he plans to spend a lot of money. Michigan. New York, his home state which was once represented by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the U.S. Senate. Florida, where he owns several golf resorts and a private club where he often lives. And Virginia, which is also home to a Trump golf course.

California and New York? Sorry, but no. Michigan? Maybe. But to make that happen, he’d have to pull off a large double digit swing among those blue collar whites that supposedly love him so much.

* TRUMP’S BOGUS ECONOMIC CREDENTIALS: Paul Krugman takes apart the idea that Donald Trump’s supposedly formidable business skills equip him to run the country:

Does business success carry with it the knowledge and instincts needed to make good economic policy? No, it doesn’t….a country is nothing like a corporation, and running a national economy is nothing like running a business….A tycoon who has enough humility to realize that he doesn’t already know all the answers, and is willing to listen to other people even when they contradict him, could do fine as an economic manager. But does this describe anyone currently running for president?

As Krugman notes, however, Trump is currently favored over Clinton on the economy. We’ll see what happens to those numbers after Democrats spend a few hundred million prosecuting his business past, however.",2016-05-29 19:43:00

36,Its very likely. ,http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/north-korea-bank/484628/?utm_campaign=fuckapathy,"A security research company has found ties between $81 million stolen from the central bank of Bangladesh, the Sony email hacks, and bank thefts across the world.

Security investigators linked thefts from banks in Asia, including the $81 million stolen from the central bank of Bangladesh in February, to a hacking group in North Korea.

The research firm Symantec has been looking into the Bangladesh bank heist, and on Thursday it posted on its blog that a similar code used to steal Bangladesh’s millions was also used to hack a bank in the Philippines, as well as a failed attempt on a bank in Vietnam last year. The code, Symantec said, has also been linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures’s emails.

Investigators say the malware the thieves used shared similarities to the code used by a hacking group known as Lazarus. The FBI has linked this group to the Sony hacks, and those hacks to North Korea. That group has also been tied to attacks as far back as 2009, which mainly focused on the U.S. and South Korea, but it is also believed to be responsible for hacks on countries all over the world, such as the $12 million stolen from an Ecuadoran bank last year.

The way hackers broke into the banks was by infiltrating the industry’s global messaging system, SWIFT. The system is run by the world’s largest banks, is based in Brussels, and prides itself on security.

The New York Times adds:

North Korea’s economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations. Pyongyang does not publish economic data, but estimates have put North Korea’s gross domestic product between $12 billion and $40 billion, tiny when compared with South Korea’s economic output of more than $1.4 trillion.

An expert quoted by the Times said: “If you presume it’s North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P. This is not small change for them.”

Since investigators learned how hackers stole Bangladesh’s money, banks that had kept similar heists quiet have come forward: Just last week, it was revealed in a lawsuit that the Banco del Austro in Ecuador was targeted, as well.",2016-05-28 23:41:00
37,The economy. More people are flying. ,https://www.vox.com/2016/5/27/11790252/airport-security-lines-tsa,"Since March, the nation's biggest airports have been in the grips of a line apocalypse. Security lines have metastasized. What were once unusually long waits have become routine. Big airports are threatening to kick out the Transportation Security Administration and turn the security process back over to private contractors.

Watch the security line at DIA grow. From 4:30, to 5:00, to 5:45. Now it's almost to baggage claim @DenverChannel pic.twitter.com/r9sWcNrK0m — Jason Gruenauer (@JGonTV) May 26, 2016

The lines aren't invariably nightmarish at every airport, all day long. Still, many people, including me, have missed flights because they arrived at the airport at what used to be a reasonable time and found themselves still trapped in line as their flight took off.

The immediate reason for the long lines is pretty simple: Americans are flying more than ever, and the TSA hasn't grown quickly enough to keep up. But the current mess is also a direct result of the TSA's last crisis. Last fall, the agency got in trouble for not doing enough to keep weapons and explosives off planes, and stepped up security as a result.

The TSA has serious problems with culture and management, including disciplining whistleblowers who called out problems. But it's also stuck between a rock and a hard place, the victim of a political consensus that insists airport security must be perfectly airtight without ever being even the slightest bit inconvenient.

Lines are getting longer partly because more people are flying

In one sense, the long lines are good news: They're a sign of economic recovery as more people are flying.

The number of Americans flying dropped precipitously as the recession began, and didn't recover to its 2007 level until 2014. But over the past year and a half, many more people have been flying: Nearly 900 million people passed through American airports in 2015, up 5 percent from 2014. The number of people the TSA had to screen, since some of those passengers came from foreign airports, increased by 6 percent.

At the same time, airplane tickets have gotten cheaper as oil prices have fallen. The average domestic plane ticket cost $363 last year, down 8 percent from 2014. It was less expensive to fly in 2015 than in any year since 2010.

So far this year, both trends have continued. Overall passenger traffic increased 4 percent in January and 6 percent in February compared with 2014, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Some of the biggest airports — Denver, Los Angeles, New York's JFK, and San Francisco — have seen even bigger increases.

Fares, too, are continuing to fall. Hopper, an app that tracks airline ticket prices, is predicting the lowest summer airfares since 2009.

But more people flying also means more people in security lines. And TSA staffing hasn't kept up. There are 15 percent more people flying than in 2013, and the TSA has 12 percent fewer staff.

Congress isn't wholly to blame for the budget cuts. The Department of Homeland Security's own budget request for the 2016 fiscal year proposed cutting 1,666 screeners' jobs, saying that ""risk-based screening practices"" — such as getting people signed up for TSA's PreCheck program, which allows you access to expedited security if you pass a background check and pay $85 — were making checkpoints more efficient. The goal, the department wrote, was to ""continue transitioning to a smaller, more skilled, professional workforce.""

The agency now admits that this was a mistake, and is hiring 768 more screeners.

Some airports want to solve the problem by hiring contractors to handle security rather than the TSA, though it's not clear if that would make much of a difference. Some airports with privatized security still have passengers reporting long lines, including San Francisco International and Rochester, New York:

Too long to get through security! Over 1 hr at ROC @asktsa 20 of us missed the flight #iHateTheWait https://t.co/iXzRm7jnUg — Erin Briggs, RN (@ErinBWellness) May 8, 2016

Lines weren't longer before because the TSA was sending people to expedited security

As airline passenger counts were reaching record-breaking levels in 2014, the TSA also started hurrying people through its expedited security lanes.

Since 2011, the TSA has offered PreCheck, which essentially offers pre-9/11 security for a price: Travelers at more than 150 airports keep their shoes and jackets on and their laptops and liquids in their bags, and they get to go through a regular metal detector rather than a body-scanning machine.

But initially the program didn't catch on as widely as the TSA hoped. Most Americans aren't frequent fliers, and the program cost $85. By late 2014, fewer than half a million people had signed up for PreCheck, the Wall Street Journal reported.

So in order to make sure the PreCheck lines were used, the TSA started routing regular passengers into them. In September 2013, just 10 percent of passengers got expedited screening — because they were over 70 or under 12, or because they were preapproved through PreCheck or Global Entry, a program focused on world travelers that allows them to get through customs more quickly.

Then in October 2013, the TSA expanded PreCheck to people who hadn't directly signed up for it, and the number of people getting expedited security immediately tripled.

There were a few ways to get PreCheck access without paying for it — you could be selected before arriving at the airport, based on the information you provide when you book your ticket, a program known as Secure Flight.

Or you could be routed into the PreCheck lanes at the airport once you were already there, a program known as ""managed inclusion."" The TSA would randomly assign people to either normal or expedited security lines. TSA officers observing travelers' behavior could pull you out of the expedited line, and explosives detection hand swab machines and dogs were supposed to add an additional layer of security.

The Government Accountability Office warned in March 2015 that these procedures hadn't been fully tested. Previous reports had suggested that the behavior detection officers aren't all that effective — a conclusion the TSA disagrees with. Still, at the time, the TSA was sending nearly half of all passengers to expedited screening, even though only about 7.2 million were actually qualified for PreCheck based on their background check, security clearance, or other factors:

Expediting the security lines sped up security and reduced the need for TSA screeners. But it also meant that security itself was less thorough. And if there's one thing the American people hate more than long security lines, it's the idea that a terrorist might be able to get a knife, gun, or bomb onto an airplane.

The TSA is trying to be less bad at its actual job: security

Then, starting last summer, a report from the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general concluded that the TSA was very, very bad at its actual job. Although the report was supposed to be classified, some damning details leaked: 95 percent of attempts to sneak prohibited items through security were successful.

The test results ""were disappointing and troubling,"" John Roth, the inspector general, said in congressional testimony in November. ""We found layers of security simply missing.""

Randomly choosing passengers for PreCheck took a lot of heat. Congressional hearings featured one whistleblower who said the TSA was ""handing out PreCheck status like Halloween candy.""

So in response, the TSA clamped down on security. It was obvious that this would lead to longer security waits, as Jason Edward Harrington, a former TSA employee, wrote for the Guardian in June 2015:

The greatest challenge when it comes to such failures stems from the fundamental catch-22 of the TSA’s mission: if agents properly execute their duties, then internal testing results will improve and airplanes might be slightly safer. But meticulous adherence to the TSA’s standard of practice will mean lines that back up to the ticketing counters. Flights will be missed due to the enormous security delays, and the distended passenger lines themselves will become choice terrorist targets. It’s a classic quantity-versus-quality dilemma.

In October 2015, the TSA discontinued managed inclusion, the program that sends travelers into PreCheck lines at the airport and monitors them with behavior officers and explosive trace detectors.

Starting last fall, the TSA and some reporters warned that lines were going to get longer. Washington, DC's airports noticed the change almost immediately, the Washington Post reported.

""I knew that would dramatically increase the number of people in the standard lanes,"" Peter Neffenger, the administration's head, said at congressional hearings this week. But the TSA had planned its budget assuming the expedited screening was going to continue.

Since the uproar began about the long lines, Neffenger said the agency is holding daily calls with the busiest airports and has established a national command center to monitor security wait times. And some travelers still manage to breeze through the lines with no trouble:

One week ago: 1+ hour waits @ATLairport but now NO LINE for main security checkpoint pic.twitter.com/OOvPvW2Sux — Steve Gehlbach (@SteveGWSB) May 23, 2016

But as long as Americans insist that airport security be flawless, cheap, and fast, the seesawing between outrage that the TSA is too slow and that the TSA isn't doing enough is likely to continue.

38,Because they have their own minor-league spelling bee circuit. ,http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2010/06/why_are_indian_kids_so_good_at_spelling.html,"On Thursday night, 13-year-old Jairam Hathwar and 11-year-old Nihar Janga were declared co-winners of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, making this the ninth bee in a row to name an Indian-American victor. In honor of their victory, Slate revisits Ben Paynter’s story, originally published in 2010, which explains Indian-Americans’ prowess in spelling competitions. It is reprinted below.

This April’s North South Foundation bee in Shawnee, Kan., might seem like an obscure place to find the spelling world’s two biggest stars. Mostly, it looked like the sort of geeky local bee I might have attended as a kid—except everyone there was Indian. Inside Shawnee’s Hindu Temple and Cultural Center, 23 awkward kids took turns passing a microphone back and forth in a hushed beige auditorium. No spotlights, no podium, just cringe-inducing feedback on the P.A. system. And for the record, the spelling was a-t-r-o-c-i-o-u-s. Just three of the first 10 contestants spelled their words correctly. At one point, a poor kid paced in circles and clutched his crotch before misspelling beleaguered and sprinting off to the restroom.

Amid it all, 13-year-old Kavya Shivashankar pronounced words from a fold-out judging table as her father, Mirle, emceed in a sharp dark suit. Kavya, the 2009 Scripps National Spelling Bee champion, is a spelling superstar complete with signature move: She air-writes each word across her palm before speaking it. Kavya and Mirle—her innovative, ever-enthusiastic coach—were at the small-time competition to pay homage. Over the past two decades, tournaments like this one—a regional qualifier for the North South Foundation’s spelling league—have become a breeding ground for Scripps contenders. These minor-league competitions help kids as young as 6 years old work out the spelling kinks at an early age. The result has been an Indian-American dynasty at the National Spelling Bee.

Consider the facts: Indian-Americans make up about 1 percent of the U.S. population; this year, an estimated 30 NSF-ers will compete at Scripps, 11 percent of the 273-kid field. Recent winners include Sai R. Gunturi from Dallas, who nonchalantly reassembled pococurante for a national title in 2003. Sameer Mishra from West Lafayette, Ind., nailed guerdon in 2008. And four-time finalist Shivashankar made it back-to-back titles for North South Foundation competitors last year, air-writing Laodicean for the win. If Shivashankar hadn’t come through, it’s possible another North South graduate would have: Four other NSF kids cracked the top 10 behind her.

The NSF circuit consists of 75 chapters run by close to 1,000 volunteers. The competitions, which began in 1993, function as a nerd Olympiad for Indian-Americans—there are separate divisions for math, science, vocab, geography, essay writing, and even public speaking—and a way to raise money for college scholarships for underprivileged students in India. There is little financial reward for winners (just a few thousand dollars in college scholarships) compared with the $40,000 winning purse handed out each year by Scripps. Still, more than 3,000 kids participated in NSF’s spelling events this year due in part to what NSF founder Ratnam Chitturi calls a sort of Kavya Effect. “Most American kids look up to sports figures,” he says. “Indian kids are more interested in education, and they finally have a role model.”

Just as Kavya Shivashankar has inspired the next wave of Indian spellers, Kavya found her bee mojo during the post- Spellbound boom. Before Spellbound, the 2002 documentary that featured Indian-American Nupur Lala’s run to the 1999 Scripps title, many first-generation South Asian parents saw NSF as a way for their children to assimilate—the best way to understand a culture, after all, is to learn its language. They used the North South Foundation events as a sort of SAT prep, teaching their children to use phonetics, etymology, and word roots to suss out answers. “Our focus is not on competition,” says Chitturi. “Winning becomes an outcome of you focusing on learning. You are competing against yourself, not these other people.”

Advertisement

Advertisement

After Spellbound, that changed a bit. After Balu Natarajan (winning word: milieu) became the first Indian-American to win Scripps back in 1985, he went on to a career in sports medicine. When Lala did it in 1999 with logorrhea, she became a movie star. (OK, a movie star and a neuroscientist.) Kavya has called Lala an inspiration—the license plate of Mirle’s teal minivan reads “SPL BND.” She’s far from alone. In 2002, NSF had less than 20 chapters pulling in about 500 mostly middle-school-age spellers. Then pop culture galvanized an expansion to elementary schoolers; today, six times as many students compete in North South Foundation spelling events. “The parents were just excited,” Chitturi says. “They saw that it was a possibility [to win the National Spelling Bee].”

Advertisement

It’s no coincidence, then, that in the last decade North South Foundation has transformed from an SAT prep course into a training ground for Scripps. It wasn’t too long ago that NSF standouts like Kamran Riaz and 2000 champion Ashley Thakur didn’t compete at the National Spelling Bee. Riaz, for one, remembers NSF as a nice “alternative” to Scripps. Thakur’s thoughts on the National Spelling Bee: “Not to brag, but I don’t think it would be a hard cake to cut,” she once bragged to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Advertisement

Advertisement

It’s not quite right to say that Riaz and Thakur didn’t go to nationals because they didn’t think it was a big deal. The more significant reason is that they simply weren’t eligible. You have to be more than a great speller to qualify for the National Bee—you also have to live in a school district with a sponsoring newspaper or community organization. These days, parents seem to be paying a lot more attention to such logistics. When Mirle Shivashankar realized in 2005 that there was just one Scripps sponsor in all of Kansas, he beat the bushes to ensure that more kids from the state—his daughter, for one—would have the chance to go to nationals. Kavya subsequently gained all of her berths to the nationals by virtue of a brand-new sponsor, the Olathe News.

The North South Foundation could dominate Scripps even further, if more of its spellers were eligible to compete. In areas with more gifted NSFers than competition zones, the battle to get into Scripps can be intense. Whereas regional North South Foundation competitions are run like standardized tests—the best scores get weighted against a national average to determine the national finalists—Scripps operates more like a crazy single-elimination tournament. The winner in each local bracket funnels into a pool of finalists, who repeat the same process to pick a winner. That can lead to some powerhouse regional showdowns. In San Jose, Calif., for instance, eventual 2009 NSF senior co-champion Ramya Auroprem had to beat out 2009 NSF runner-up Sidarth Jayadev just to make it into last year’s National Spelling Bee finals.

North South Foundation winners don’t have to worry about Kavya Shivashankar anymore—she has retired. At the Shawnee NSF contest this April, Swetha Jasti placed first, with a perfect score that qualified her for NSF nationals later this summer. But unfortunately for Jasti, she won’t make it to Scripps this year. When the National Spelling Bee starts up this week, their region will be represented by a surprise challenger: Kavya’s 8-year-old sister, Vanya, who drubbed Jasti in the National Spelling Bee’s Olathe qualifier.

For youngsters like Vanya, this is Scripps’ best selling point: Whereas the North South Foundation still divides contestants into junior and senior levels, the National Spelling Bee has no minimum age requirement. Vanya, who has taken to referring to herself and her sister as the Eli and Peyton Manning of spelling, will be the youngest competitor in Washington, D.C., this year. When ESPN recently showed up in Kansas to film a miniprofile for the contest, she grinned unabashedly. “Now it’s my turn,” she proclaimed to the room full of cameras. As with most things in the life of an NSF standout, the moment seemed well-rehearsed.

39,"Children's ""Safe Space/Classrooms"". ",https://www.devp.org/en/blog/youll-never-guess-whats-inside-tent,"Upon my recent visit to Iraq, I saw the intense psychological distress that over 500,000 Iraqi Yazidis1 experience every day. They have had to abandon their houses and families in order to o survive the violence of the armed group calling itself the Islamic State, who’s made lightning-fast advances throughout the country.

All of them suffered the horrors of war in some way, and many of them are still plagued by the effects of post-traumatic stress. The vast majority of the victims are under 18.

Young Yazidi in the Dahuk region of northern Iraq

What can we do for these uprooted youths, forced to live far from their homes in camps or makeshift shelters? What happens when the closest school is four hours away on foot and so overcrowded it cannot accept any new students?

This is why for the last few months Development and Peace, in partnership with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD), has been involved in a project to create youth centres that provide these kids in dire need with a safe space.

This tent lets 240 children learn in a fun environment and helps them return to a normal routine.

Thanks to our project, over 900 children have access, twice a week, to a tent, the inside of which resembles a classroom.

On site, an intervention team offers children a variety of activities and a positive environment in which they can feel safe. Women account for at least 50% of each team, as children are more likely to confide their psychological distress to a woman. Furthermore, some of the staff hired to run these centres are displaced people, in an effort to provide them and their families with extra income.



The tents’ interior looks like a classroom, and fun and educational activities are offered to the children.

Priority activities

Thanks to our partners’ experience with other displaced populations, and after consulting the target population during the analysis phase of the project, it was decided to offer five types of activities in the centres:

Recreational games for children;

Informal education, by age group, with an emphasis on building vocabulary;

Team-spirit building activities;

Peaceful conflict-resolution activities; and

Activities in which children can talk about the stress they’ve experienced.

Colouring activity in the village of Shaekadry’s youth centre (Iraqi Kurdistan)

These spaces are also used by the staff to assess the wellbeing of the children, and ensure that they receive the psychological care they might require. Already, close to 50 children have been diagnosed with severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and have been referred to a specialist who will be able to give them proper care.



These centres are not meant to replace real schools, but in a context of mass displacement and overcrowded classrooms, they ensure that children can continue their education while on the waiting list to enroll permanently in a local school. Without this interim program, a whole generation might struggle with learning issues and face a bleak future.

It is not too late to make a donation and help more children gain access to these centres.



Here are a few children I had the privilege of meeting:





Sonja, age 15, wants to learn Arabic and English.

Lisa, age 11, thanks us for creating this centre. She likes the activities offered, but wishes she could take Arabic lessons.

Shamo, age 12, loves it when we teach him some English words.

Randy, age 12, is grateful when teachers manage to make him forget “the things he’s seen” and hopes to become an engineer.

40,$14 Billion last year. ,http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/26/you-wont-believe-how-much-banks-make-in-overdraft.aspx,"The bank overdraft fee seems a bit like the financial equivalent of kicking a man when he's down. Having to pay $35 or so because you don't have enough money to cover a check you wrote is like having life hand you lemons -- and then squirt lemon juice in your eye.

Basically, the overdraft and its cousin, the fee for insufficient funds, amount to a further tax on people who are already not doing so well. To make matters worse, in many cases overdraft fees can set off a cascade of unexpected bad checks for people operating on a tight budget. That can turn a $35 problem into something much bigger, according to the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL), which just released a research report entitled ""Broken Banking: How Overdraft Fees Harm Consumers and Discourage Responsible Bank Products.""

In the report, which examined data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, CRL essentially found that overdraft fees were too lucrative for banks to consider giving them up. Even if they want to reform -- and some banks have made changes to certain accounts -- it's hard to walk away from the $14 billion in overdraft fees ($17 billion when you add in charges for insufficient funds) American banks generated last year, according to CRL.

""CRL's analysis confirms that overdraft abuses continue, carrying an enormous annual price tag for consumers as a whole, and with devastating effects on individuals,"" said Peter Smith, a senior researcher at CRL and the report's co-author in a press release.

Is the number really that high?

In the first three months of 2015 the three biggest banks in the United States -- JPMporgan Chase ( JPM -2.81% ), Bank of America ( BAC -3.62% ), and Wells Fargo ( WFC -4.78% ) -- made $1.1 billion in overdraft fees, CNN Money reported. That projects out to $4.5 billion in 2015, or $20 for every America adult, reported the website.

For the big banks, however, overdraft fees represent only a small percentage of total revenue. Even though the totals add up to astounding numbers, overdraft fees accounted for less than 6% of non-interest revenue at JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, according to a report by SNL Financial.

Smaller banks, the study found, can make much more than the overall median of 8% non-interest revenue. Woodforest National Bank, which had over 750 branches in 17 states, and First National, which operated just under 300 locations, made more than 40% of their of non-interest revenue from overdraft charges at the time of the study, according to SNL Financial.

""These banks are highly reliant on these charges,"" says Tyler Hall, a senior bank analyst at SNL Financial. ""It just points out that's their business model.""

Altogether, in the first three months of 2015, the nearly 600 banks that reported overdraft fees took in $2.5 billion in overdraft fees -- not quite as much as CRL projects, but not so far off as to make its report invalid.

How does this happen?

For consumers with low balances, an unexpected overdraft fee dig a hole that's hard to get out of. CRL explained the process in its press release.

Frequently marketed as a 'customer service', overdraft fees are incurred when a bank account lacks sufficient funds to cover a transaction and the institution pays the transaction anyway. The institution then repays itself the value of the overdraft transactions, and all accompanying fees, from the account holder's next incoming deposit.

Debit card payments and paper check payments alike can result in overage fees, which average $35, but that may only be the start of the problem. ""If time lags before the account is replenished, the institution may charge additional 'sustained' overdraft fees, and a bank is also able to charge for multiple overdrafts before the account is replenished,"" according to the CRL report.

""Financial institutions take advantage of consumers fighting desperately to stay afloat,"" said Rebecca Borné, report co-author and CRL senior policy counsel. ""CFPB should require that overdraft fees be reasonable and proportional to the cost to the institution, much the same way that credit card penalty fees are regulated. Overdraft fees should also be limited to one per month and six per year.""

What happens next?

Many of the smaller banks make so much money on overdraft fees that they have little incentive to reform. The larger banks like JPMporgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, however, could in theory spur a change, given that they don't rely on overdraft fees for much of their revenue.

One simple way to reform these practices, according to CRL, would simply be to deny charges when consumers do not have the funds in their account to pay for them. That would stop the chain dead before it has a chance to snowball on the consumer, and it would stop the banks from offering unregulated de facto credit products to consumers who can't afford them.",2016-05-28 15:23:50

43,69% more for out-of-pocket health care costs than men. ,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/women-pay-more-healthcare,"When it comes to healthcare, being a woman means you'll have some extra, shall we say, considerations. Shouldering the brunt of the birth control burden, making regular trips to the gyno for screenings, and, oh yeah, that whole political firestorm surrounding a woman’s right to access certain types of healthcare are just a few of the things that women have to factor into their decisions.

But according to new data from healthcare company Vitals, women have one more thing to worry about: disproportionate costs.

On average, women pay 69 percent more for out-of-pocket healthcare costs than men.

Vitals

Although groan-inducing, the numbers aren’t that surprising. The bills for standard preventative care, breast and ovarian cancer screenings, and birth control—not to mention being actually, you know, sick—aren’t cheap. The costs add up.

Sign up for Women's Health's new newsletter, So This Happened, to get the day’s trending stories and health studies.

According to the data from Vitals, women can expect to shell out some serious cash for the health issues we encounter over a lifetime. One in four women will have her tubes tied, which can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $6,000. And women are four to six times more likely than men to have knee pain, which can mean a $65,000 knee replacement. Even barring any of these major expenses, regular old mammograms can run up to $200 a pop. Not cool.

Time to start thinking about making healthcare costs a bigger line item in your long-term budget.

52,No. ,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/10/9886152/donald-trump-fascism,"Is Donald Trump a fascist?

That question emerged in various forms pretty early in his 2016 presidential campaign, which began with a speech railing against Mexican immigrants, and gained steam after he called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” in December 2015, as a response to the San Bernardino terrorist attack.

At that point, the Muslim ban proposal, I contacted five fascism experts and asked them if Trump qualified. They all said no. Every one of them stated that to be a fascist, one must support the revolutionary, usually violent overthrow of the entire government/Constitution, and reject democracy entirely. In 2015, none were comfortable saying Trump went that far. He was too individualist for the inherently collectivist philosophy of fascism, and not sufficiently committed to the belief that violence is good for its own sake, as a vital cleansing force.

Roger Griffin, the author of The Nature of Fascism and a professor of history at Oxford Brookes University, summed it up well: “You can be a total xenophobic racist male chauvinist bastard and still not be a fascist.”

Five years have now passed, and the fascism questions have only grown more frequent. Trump has had time to implement quite anti-immigrant and anti-Black policies, and refused to denounce his most extreme and violent supporters, from the neo-Nazis and white nationalists in Charlottesville to the Proud Boys group. And every week, I receive dozens of emails from readers wondering if I stand by my conclusion in 2015, that Trump is simply a bigot with an authoritarian streak, not a fascist.

So I reached out to the experts I talked to back then. Four of the five replied, and I also got in touch with a few more scholars who have researched fascism to get a broader view.

The responses were, again, unanimous, albeit tinged with much greater concern about Trump’s authoritarian and violent tendencies. No one thinks Trump is a fascist leader, full stop. Jason Stanley, a Yale philosopher and author of How Fascism Works, came closest to that conclusion, saying that “you could call legitimately call Trumpism a fascist social and political movement” and that Trump is “using fascist political tactics,” but that Trump isn’t necessarily leading a fascist government.

But most experts did not even go that far, and some expressed concern that describing Trump as a fascist undermines the term and leads to a misanalysis of our current political situation. “If Trump was a fascist and we were in a situation akin to Germany in 1932 or Italy in 1921, certain kinds of actions would be justified,” Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, says. “But we are not and they are not.”

To be clear, “not fascist” is a very, very low bar for Trump to clear. The concerns that lead people to ask the question “Is Trump a fascist?” are real. Trump really is trying to discredit the coming presidential election. He really has hired officials with ties to white nationalist groups. He really did promise to ban all Muslims from the US (and implemented new rules toward that goal), said that a Mexican American judge is unfit to preside over cases involving him, called Mexican immigrants “rapists,” empathized with neo-Nazis after Charlottesville, and falsely claimed Muslim Americans celebrated the 9/11 attacks — among many, many transgressions.

But things could always get worse. There really are leaders who suspend elections, dissolve legislatures, throw large numbers of citizens into camps without trial or appeal, who turn their nations into one-party states oriented around a cult of national rebirth. The fascist leaders of the past, the University of Texas’s Jason Brownlee notes, “not only pursued right-wing policies, they also built-up mass-mobilizing parties and paramilitary organizations with the goal of sweeping aside alternative movements and establishing single-party dictatorship.”

That hasn’t happened here — but it could. It came terrifyingly close to happening in Greece, where the explicitly neo-Nazi Golden Dawn became the third-largest political party in the mid-2010s. And if and when it does happen in America, we need to have the right terms and tools to confront it.

Robert Paxton, Mellon professor emeritus of social sciences, Columbia University

I stand by what I have already written about Trump and fascism, but there is one change: I am struck now with Trump’s growing willingness to employ physical violence.

Before, Trump was already willing to tolerate some roughing-up of hecklers at rallies, and his encouragement of the “lock her up!” refrain was clearly transgressive (in America we are supposed to wait for the decision of a jury of citizens before locking someone up). But now, after Charlottesville, we have the Proud Boys and the aggression against the governor of Michigan. So Trump gets closer to having his own SA [the Nazi paramilitary group], a sobering thought as the election approaches.

But there is still no state management of the economy here (as there was to a degree in Nazi Germany and fascist Italy). Trump is content to aid business by reducing government protections of the environment and of workers … and his economic policy is mainly just to let businessmen do what they want, So I still think terms like “oligarchy” and “plutocracy” work for Trump, with the added thought that he is close to crossing the line with his toleration of violence.

Matthew Feldman, director, Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right

Although my position has not changed on Trump — less fascist than kleptocrat, more egoist than radical-right ideologue — that does little to mitigate the danger.

Four months ago, I warned that Trump was descending into naked authoritarianism. Low-information commentators seek to reassure rather than dig deeply, telling readers to look on the bright side. That the US is an exceptional country.

It is not.

Democratic regression and political polarization are not unique to the US. Having more guns than people is. So are militias, usually formed of lower- and middle-class white Americans harboring anti-government sentiments. The threat posed by these anti-government extremists — though not necessarily terrorists — was thrown into relief when at least 13 members of Michigan’s Wolverine Militia were arrested for planning to kidnap, “judge,” and potentially execute for treason the state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer.

The term “fascist” regarding Trump continues to mislead rather than inform. But that cannot inure us to what Alexander Reid Ross has called the “fascist creep.”

Stanley Payne, Jaume Vicens Vives and Hilldale professor emeritus of history, the University of Wisconsin Madison

This inquiry made a little sense four years ago, when Trump was still an unknown quantity, but now he has a record. Well — that’s pretty thin gruel. Nothing much to work with here. The Democrats won the first election under Trump [the 2018 midterms], and I’m not aware of anything negative happening. Straining at gnats doesn’t really get us anywhere. Mostly these are just silly public remarks. Hitler’s place in history is not based on his remarks, nor for any temporary detention cages. Please do not trivialize. That indicates absence of an argument.

Roger Griffin, emeritus professor in modern history, Oxford Brookes University

His relationship to democracy, I would really insist, is the key to answering whether he’s a fascist or not. Even in four years of incoherent and inconsistent tweets, he’s never actually done a Putin and tried to make himself a permanent president, let alone suggest any coherent plan for overthrowing the constitutional system. And I don’t even think that’s in his mind. He is an exploiter, he’s a freeloader. He’s a wheeler and dealer. And that is not the same as an ideologue.

So he’s absolutely not a fascist. He does not pose a challenge to constitutional democracy. He certainly poses a great challenge to liberalism and liberal democracy. And I think real favor will be served by journalists who, instead of seeing liberal democracy as a single entity, see it as a binomial. Democracy can exist without liberalism.

If I was doing this as a bottom line in some debate, I’d say that Trump is not a fascist, but what he is quite consistently is an illiberal democrat. He is a democrat to the extent that he’s used democratic processes to be where he is, which he doesn’t radically challenge. He obviously plays fast and loose, like any wheeler dealer, with things like the Supreme Court, who he gets in, etc. He doesn’t care about the rules, but the core system he doesn’t want to change, because he’s somebody who’s profited by that system.

Basically, I think it matters whether we call Trump fascist or not fascist, not academically or intellectually, but because it’s a red herring — it actually diverts attention from where we should be doing the critique. If all our intellectual energies are, like Don Quixote, jousting with windmills and fascism, instead of actually jousting with the real enemies of democracy, and using our energies to avert the climate crisis, which is going to engulf us all, if we’re not careful, then we’re wasting our time.

By not calling him fascist, and concentrating on the way he perverts democracy, we see Trump in a different context. We don’t see him as Hitler or Mussolini. We see him in a different rogues’ gallery. And the rogues’ gallery is made up of a whole load of dictators throughout history, including Putin and Erdogan and Orbán and Assad today, who have abused constitutionalism and democracy to rationalize their abuse of power and their crimes against humanity.

Sheri Berman, professor of political science, Barnard College, Columbia University

On Trump and fascism, unlike what has become an almost majority view, I do not like applying that term to Trump or to what is going on in this country.

Partially this is for historical and intellectual reasons — just like we shouldn’t call every horrible example of ethnic violence or even ethnic cleansing “genocide” (or say that it is another Holocaust), so I think we should be careful with comparing Trump to Hitler. Genocide means something: It is an attempt to wipe out an entire people, using the full force of the modern state. Similarly, national socialism or, more broadly, fascism was a totalitarian ideology and political regime that wanted to do away not only with liberalism and democracy but to revolutionize society, economy, and politics. That’s not the same as any old dictatorship, even a nasty one, and that is not where we are today.

That said, just as ethnically based violence or ethnic cleansing shares some characteristics with genocide/the Holocaust, so too does Trump bear similarities to other strongmen, a category in which fascists like Hitler and Mussolini belong, as do Orbán, Erdogan, Putin, and their ilk. That Trump maintains his support by engaging in explicitly divisive appeals designed to pit groups against each other — particularly but not exclusively ethnic groups — also, of course, bears some similarity to what fascists did.

And, of course, Trump is undermining various norms and institutions of democracy. But this doesn’t make him a fascist, which means much more than these things. Indeed, I almost think calling Trump “fascist” gives him too much “credit” — he isn’t strategic enough, ideological enough, or ambitious enough. And as bad as things are today, we are still not in 1930s Germany.

But alongside these historical and intellectual reasons, I also don’t like applying the term fascist to Trump for practical reasons. If Trump was a fascist and we were in a situation akin to Germany in 1932 or Italy in 1921, certain kinds of actions would be justified. But we are not, and they are not. And that remains important to stress, even though that does not mean downplaying the real threat Trump and the version of the Republican Party that is backing him represents to our country.

I think Trump often engages in what the political science literature refers to as “ethnic outbidding.” Even more fitting, in my view, is the term “negative integration” — a strategy of unifying a coalition by whipping up fear/hatred of purported enemies. Bismarck was the classic practitioner of the negative integration strategy.

As for Trump overall, I would still prefer referring to him as an illiberal populist or right-wing populist. He has a lot in common with the right-wing populists roaming around Europe today.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, professor of Italian and history, New York University

Trump certainly uses fascist tactics, from holding rallies to refresh the leader-follower bond to creating a “tribe” (MAGA hats, rituals like chanting “lock them up,” etc.) to unleashing a volume of propaganda without precedent by an American president. Yet the political cultures that form him and his close supporters are not fascist, but reflect a broader authoritarian history. Paul Manafort and Roger Stone worked for [Congolese dictator] Mobutu Sese Seko and [Philippine President] Ferdinand Marcos before Trump, and Manafort also worked for Putin. They worked on Marcos’s 1986 election that was widely denounced as fraudulent.

Trump’s role models include leaders like Erdogan and Putin who are not exactly fascists, but something more: authoritarians, or strongman rulers who also use virility as a tool of domination.

I also favor authoritarian over fascist as a description for Trump because the former captures how autocratic power works today. In the 21st century, fascist takeovers have been replaced by rulers who come to power through elections and then, over time, extinguish freedom.

Jason Brownlee, professor of government, the University of Texas at Austin

Of course Trump’s detractors are free to use whatever terms and epithets they like.

I would not say the traditional idea of fascism fits Donald Trump in 2020 any more than it did before he took office. When historians and political scientists do a full accounting of his actions and statements as president, I do not think fascism will figure prominently in their analyses. The prototypical fascist leaders — Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, [Austrian Chancellor] Engelbert Dollfuss — not only pursued right-wing policies, they also built-up mass-mobilizing parties and paramilitary organizations with the goal of sweeping aside alternative movements and establishing single-party dictatorship. I would tend to describe Trump’s brand of politics differently, and I would place him in different company.

Trump is a celebrity-turned-right-wing politician. He acts as a consummate demagogue, fabulist, and ultranationalist, and he appears to have a strong inclination for nepotism and kleptocracy. His efforts to use the presidency to finance his lifestyle and enrich his family resemble the schemes of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. In addition to profiting from his time in office, Trump, like Marcos, has challenged constraints on executive authority without investing resources into a sustainable political organization.

In other respects, Trump’s style of politics recalls portions of the career of former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Like Milošević, Trump has promoted a very hierarchical, ethnically based ultranationalist vision that endorses violence against out-groups but without building up a single party the way interwar fascists did.

Jason Stanley, Jacob Urowsky professor of philosophy, Yale University

When I think about fascism, I think about it as applied to different things. There’s a fascist regime. We do not have a fascist regime. Then there’s the question of, “Is Trumpism a fascist social and political movement?” I think you could call legitimately call Trumpism a fascist social and political movement — which is not to say that Trump is a fascist. Trumpism involves a cult of the leader, and Trump embodies that. I certainly think he’s using fascist political tactics. I think there’s no question about that. He is calling for national restoration in the face of humiliations brought on by immigrants, liberals, liberal minorities, and leftists. He’s certainly playing the fascist playbook.

My definition is of fascist politics, not of a fascist regime. I think most of the other [fascism scholars] are just talking about something else. They’re talking about regimes. Toni Morrison in 1995 said the United States has long favored fascist solutions to national problems. Toni Morrison is talking about “fascist solutions.” She’s not talking about fascist regimes. She’s saying the United States has long favored fascist solutions in a democratic state, which I completely agree with: targeting minorities, mass incarceration, colonialism, seizing indigenous land. All these things are things that impacted Hitler. My work is based in the United States — it’s based in the movements that affected European fascism: the KKK, Jim Crow, the anti-miscegenation law, slavery, Indigenous genocide, the 1924 Immigration Act and similar US immigration laws that Hitler lauds in Mein Kampf.

If you’re only worried about fascist regimes, you’re never going to catch fascist social and political movements. The goal is to catch fascist social and political movements, and fascist ideology, before it becomes a regime.",2016-05-23 01:30:00
53,To satisfy the demand for seafood. ,http://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/appetite-for-fish-is-turning-the-ocean-into-a-floating-pig-farm/,"Let’s face it, most people are entirely unaware of the methods used to produce the food they eat every day. There might be a sort of idyllic image of farm involved somewhere, but by and large, the reality of how food – especially meat, dairy, eggs, and fish – gets to the table is shrouded in mystery. Awareness of the type of facilities where animals are raised is increasing, as more consumers actively seek out labels like “pasture-raised” and “cage-free” thinking they are in some way superior. But in the case of fish, things are a little less clear.

In recent years, wild-caught and farm-raised has become a distinction between various types of fish found in the grocery store, but can most frequently be seen attached to salmon. The average American consumes two pounds of salmon a year, around two-thirds of which comes from farmed sources in China, Norway, and Canada. While wild-caught is largely self-explanatory, what exactly does farm-raised mean in the context of fish, mainly salmon?

Floating Farms

Around 40 percent of all fish consumed annually, are raised on aquafarms which can either be land-based or ocean-based. Land-based farms raise thousands of fish in ponds, pools, or even concrete tanks, where ocean-based aquafarms house fish in isolated cages either off-shore or in the open water.

In both cases, fish are overstocked and have little space to swim or display their natural behaviors, creating an extremely stressful environment. Around 40 percent of aquafarmed fish will die before they are harvested. And with good reason. Stocking thousands of fish in a small amount of space and feeding them protein pellets (ironically made from other fish) doused with antibiotics and chemicals, such as PCB, understandably makes for highly polluted water. If you’ve ever had a fish and seen what it looks like when you forget to clean their tanks for a few weeks … you can start to fathom the idea.

Daniel Pauly, professor of fisheries at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, likens aquafarms to, “floating pig farms.”

Fish take in water through their gills to breathe, so the quality of the water they live in is very important. The water that aquafarmed fish are raised in has high levels of ammonia, nitrate, nitrites, and suspended solids. It is not uncommon that groups of fish will become infested with parasites that feed on the gills, organs, and blood of fish. Bacterial infections also run rampant. While this contained land-based facility is incredibly detrimental to the fish living on farms, when you move this to an ocean-based farm … that impact literally seeps into the surrounding environment. With thousands of fish residing in an enclosed space, there is inevitably a lot of waste being produced. This waste breeds bacteria that consume oxygen, creating low-oxygen zones. Low oxygen levels not only trigger a stress response in the aquaculture fish, but it has serious ramifications for the surrounding ocean ecosystem. Ocean-grown fish are also fed pesticides in an attempt to limit the amount of algae that grows on nets, meaning toxic copper sulfate is released into the oceans. Add antibiotics into the mix and you get factory-farmed fish superbugs. Essentially, we’re creating the perfect storm for an environmental disaster … all for the sake of having salmon on demand. The Future for Fish Sadly, despite the threat that aquaculture can pose to the ocean, many see this as the only way for us to maintain our fish supplies given that global fish stocks are on the decline. According to a study conducted and published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, 80 percent of global fish stocks are “fully- to over-exploited, depleted, or in a state of collapse.” If this trend continues then it is predicted the oceans will be all but empty by 2048. That is only 32 years away – but can we really justify the damage occuring due to aquaculture as a solution? As Nil Zacharias, Co-Founder and Editor-in-Chief of One Green Planet said, “We can’t expect to feed ourselves by draining our oceans of fish while simultaneously dumping trash into the very waters from which we source our food. Something has to give. The reality is that in the developed world, we don’t need to eat seafood.” All it takes to put an end to the harmful practice of aquaculture and start to heal the damage wrought on the world’s fish population is one choice. By leaving fish off the menu for a year, you can help keep 225 fish in the ocean and lower the demand for, as Professor Pauly put it, “floating pig farms.” The fact is, if our oceans die, we die – so it’s never been a better time to #EatForThePlanet.

54,"No, it's safer than ever. ",http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/20/aviation/air-travel-safety/index.html,"(CNN) — As officials continue to investigate what happened to EgyptAir Flight 804, many travelers can't help but question the risks they face when boarding their next flight.

Is it becoming unsafe to fly?

Just the opposite, say analysts.

As we move towards the second half of 2016, it's shaping out to be one of the safest years in recent aviation history.

""We are ahead of the 10-year average with eight accidents and 167 fatalities compared to the average of 10 accidents and 205 fatalities,"" aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas, editor of Airlineratings.com , told CNN.

Analyzing the data

Experts say measuring the number of crashes or deaths alone isn't an accurate way to determine safety. You also have to factor in the overall amount of aviation traffic.

According to data released by the International Air Transport Association , more than 3.5 billion people flew safely on 37.6 million flights (31.4 million by jet, 6.2 million by turboprop) in 2015.

In a report released earlier this year, AirlineRatings.com said that 2015 was a safer year for aviation than the previous 12 months.

It cites Aviation-Safety.net data that tallies 16 air accidents with 560 fatalities -- below the 10-year average and an improvement on 2014 when there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities.

""Flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5% of today's number,"" said the report.

There were two high-profile air travel incidents in 2015.

In March, an Airbus A320-211 operated by budget carrier Germanwings crashed into the French Alps killing all 150 people on board.

It later transpired that pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was identified as having suicidal tendencies, had caused the crash deliberately.

In October, 224 people were killed when a Russian Metrojet Airbus A321-231 broke apart shortly after takeoff from Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport in Egypt.

The disaster was claimed as a bomb attack by terror group ISIS. Investigations are still ongoing, but initial intelligence reports also pointed the finger at terrorism.

Ranking airline safety

Every year, AirlineRatings.com puts out a list of the world's safest airlines

The rating system takes into account audits from aviation's governing bodies and lead associations, as well as government audits and the airlines' fatality records.

It also examines airlines' operational histories, incident records and operational excellence.

According to the site, 148 of the 407 airlines it surveyed have the top seven-star safety ranking, but almost 50 have just three stars or less.

If an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and/or crew members it will automatically lose a star from its safety-rating rankings.

EgyptAir has a product safety rating of 5/7.",2016-05-21 17:30:00
55,Louisiana ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/05/21/this-state-is-about-to-become-the-first-where-targeting-police-is-a-hate-crime/,"The Louisiana legislation has been referred to as “Blue Lives Matter” — a phrase popularized in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, which exploded following the fatal 2014 police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo.

Black Lives Matter activists have protested what they deem as excessive force by police, and they have called attention to specific instances in which police shot unarmed civilians.

But those who respond with “Blue Lives Matter” argue it’s officers who are under assault — that criticism of police fosters animosity toward law enforcement. In Louisiana, there were eight line-of-duty deaths among law-enforcement officers in 2015, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.

Louisiana House Bill 953 faced little opposition from lawmakers; the House passed it 91 to 0, and the state Senate approved it 33 to 3. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), the son of a sheriff who has indicated that he plans to sign HB 953 into law.

Some states have floated proposals similar to the Louisiana legislation, and a bill proposed in Congress would amend federal hate-crime law to include officers as a protected class.

“Talking heads on television and inflammatory rhetoric on social media are inciting acts of hatred and violence toward our nation’s peace officers,” Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said in a statement. “Our members are increasingly under fire by individuals motivated by nothing more than a desire to kill or injure a cop.”

In 2015, 124 officers died in the line of duty, according to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund. The number of officers fatally shot declined, falling to 42 from 49 a year earlier, while the overall number of deaths increased because of more traffic accidents and job-related illnesses.Fatal shootings of officers has decreased over the previous few decades — from an average of 127 in the 1970s to 57 yearly between 2000 and 2009.

But many officers and their relatives have said they feel greater tension with the increased attention to fatal shootings by police.

Story continues below advertisement

Louisiana state Rep. Lance Harris (R), who authored the hate-crime bill, has pointed to high-profile cases in arguing for his bill.

According to the Advocate, Louisiana’s largest daily newspaper, Harris cited the brazen and deadly ambush of two New York police officers in December of 2014 and a drive-by shooting that wounded a firefighter that same month in Florida.

“We have a pretty extensive hate-crime law right now, but I believe we should add firefighters and policemen,” Harris said, according to the Advocate.

No other state includes police officers as a protected class under hate-crime laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But at least 37 states — including Louisiana — have enhanced penalties for assaulting police officers.

Story continues below advertisement

In some states, hurting a police officer can be an “aggravating factor” to an assault or battery charge. And in many states, killing a police officer can be an aggravating factor or circumstance, making it a crime eligible for the death penalty.

Edwards, the Louisiana governor, is expected to sign the “Blue Lives Matter” bill this week.

According to the Advertiser, the Edwards family “has produced four generations of Tangipahoa Parish sheriffs,” including current Sheriff Daniel Edward, the governor’s brother.

“As the son and brother of a sheriff, I have the greatest respect for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect our communities, state and nation,” Edwards said in a statement. “Police officers and firefighters often perform life-saving acts of heroism, oftentimes under very dangerous circumstances, and are integral in maintaining order and civility in our society.

“The members of the law enforcement community deserve these protections, and I look forward to signing this bill into law.”

There has been criticism of the measure outside of the state Capitol. The New Orleans chapter of activist group Black Youth Project 100 has called on Edwards to veto HB 953, arguing that citizens, not police, are under assault.

“By treating the police as specialized citizens held above criticism and the laws they are charged to enforce, we lose our ability to exercise our First Amendment right,” the organization said in a statement. “Including ‘police’ as a protected class in hate crime legislation would serve to provide more protection to an institution that is statistically proven to be racist in action, policy, and impact.”

The organization highlighted high-profile deaths of civilians in Louisiana, including that of a handcuffed Victor White III. Officials in 2014 said the 22-year-old shot himself with a gun while in the back seat of an Iberia Parish sheriff’s deputy’s car.

The regional director of the Anti-Defamation League said it’s not wise to add occupations to hate-crime protected classes. “It’s really focused on immutable characteristics,” Allison Goodman told the Advocate. “Proving the bias intent for a hate crime for law enforcement or first responders is very different than proving it for someone who is Jewish or gay or black.”

The change to Louisiana law would mean those convicted of committing felony hate crimes against police officers could face a maximum fine of $5,000 or a five-year prison sentence. A hate-crime charge added to a misdemeanor carries a $500 fine or six months imprisonment.",2016-05-21 15:17:21
56,Antibiotics resistance. ,http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/antibiotics-will-soon-stop-working-and-make-chemotherapy-too-dangerous-to-be-performed-major-report-a7036776.html,"Urgent action is needed to control the use of antibiotics before they cease to work, leaving a number of major conditions untreatable and causing “terrible human and economic cost”, a major study has warned.

Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report’s authors warn.

Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called ‘superbugs’ such as MRSA develop.

Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further. In the UK, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock.

The report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former Goldman Sachs Asset Managemet chairman Lord Jim O’Neill. The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK.

Lord O'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is 'absolutely essential' (PA)

It calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: “to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.” Among his recommendations, Lord O’Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use.

The report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050.

✕ Antibiotics crisis is global

Lord O’Neill said of the findings: “My review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. The actions I’m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now… to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face.”

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the report’s recommendations, saying: “Lord O’Neill’s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is. It is not just a threat to health but also to the world economy. Apart from the moral case for action, the economic cost of failing to act is too great to contemplate.”

Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, who previously warned that the UK is facing an “apocalyptic scenario” over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as “challenging.”

Antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, stopping infections. They transformed medicine when they were first used early last century and have contributed to the near eradication of a number of serious conditions including tuberculosis and syphilis. An estimated 40 million antibiotics are prescribed in the UK every year, of which the health regulator Nice claims 10 million are unnecessary prescriptions.",2016-05-20 10:30:00

""Jackson is a beautiful city with a wide variety of trees and other pollen-producing plants that create higher than average pollen scores when compared to other municipalities around the country,"" Alex Burgess, spokesperson for AAFA, told weather.com.

Though the number one spot may have stayed the same from last year, the rest of the top 10 saw a shakeup. Syracuse, New York, climbed to third place on this year’s list after ranking 20th in 2015. Providence, Rhode Island, and Buffalo, New York, also make appearances in this year’s top 10.

""We were surprised by Syracuse and Buffalo jumping into the top 10,"" Burgess said. ""Spring pollen levels in both cities were much higher than those recorded in other major U.S. metropolitan areas, but Buffalo experienced a significant reduction in the number of certified allergists compared to last year, which may have influenced lower than expected medication utilization.

Although there has been a trend over the last few decades of the spring allergy season inching up on the calendar, Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York and an ambassador for AAFA, told weather.com that the presence of El Niño this winter and the wet, mild winter weather much of the country saw can result in a stronger allergy season.

""In any year with an El Niño phenomenon, we expect certain areas of the country, particularly in the South, to be plagued by lots of rainfall and precipitation,"" Dr. Clifford Bassett said. ""Each year it’s different. If you look at the aerobiology, you have a lot of different pollen areas. There’s a lot of cities [in the South] that are hit hard each year during the spring allergy season.""

And Burgess agrees. ""Certain parts of the country appear to be experiencing higher than average pollen counts while others have shown lower counts,"" which could be thanks to the presence of El Niño, he said. ""Generally speaking, the United States has experienced a warmer than typical winter coupled with late winter precipitation that has created an earlier pollen season than typically seen. Pollen counts are on the rise around the country and individuals who experience seasonal allergies need to be proactive and meet with their allergists to prepare a plan to address their symptoms.""

60,San Bernardino. ,http://www.laweekly.com/news/heres-the-most-dangerous-city-in-california-6938087,"When asked to name the most dangerous place for crime in California, Compton, L.A.'s Eastside or the East Bay might come to mind.

You'd be wrong.

The most dangerous city in the Golden State when it comes to crime, police presence and other “community factors” such as poverty, the high school graduation rate and comparatively low police budgets, is in the Inland Empire.

It's San Bernardino.

That, at least, is according to the Southern California law firm of Graham Donath, which commissioned a report that crunches the numbers and gives us a list of California's most dangerous cities.

San Bernardino, a Great Recession–embattled town that's in bankruptcy, doesn't have the highest crime rate. Oakland and Stockton are worse when it comes to serious, violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and assault), the analysis found.

But when all the factors were calculated, including unemployment, police per capita and even the number of days in a year when the high temperature was higher than 80 degrees, San Bernardino is your winner, the Donath report says.

The city, for example, ranked in the top 10 for municipalities with the lowest investment in law enforcement. It also ranked in the top 10 for those “community factors” we talked about.

All across this great state there's a lot to be desired when it comes to fixing lawlessness, however.

The analysis notes that all of its top-10 cities had a poverty rate of nearly 15 percent (14.5) or greater. That includes Los Angeles, where about one in five people (21.2 percent) lives in poverty, according to the report.

San Bernardino's poverty rate is pegged at a whopping 30.6 percent.

The analysis cites the high cost of living as a possible pressure point for crime. We don't need to tell you that housing costs in L.A. are out of control.

“One explanation for high poverty levels in California cities could be the rising cost of living with stagnant wages,” the report says. “The poverty has actually grown in the state since 2007, and this could be because the increased cost of living is sending people into debt. It’s also encouraging people to leave or discouraging them from moving to the state.”

Los Angeles, by the way, ranked 19th on the dangerous cities list.",2016-05-18 16:00:00

Washington CNN —

At first glance, the National Vietnam Veterans Foundation is a roaring success. According to its tax filings, the charity has received more than $29 million in donations from generous Americans from 2010 to 2014 for what it calls on its website “aiding, supporting and benefiting America’s veterans and their families.”

But look a little closer on those same filings and you can see that nearly all of those donations have been cycled back to telemarketers, leaving less than 2 percent for actual veterans and veterans’ charitable causes.

That’s why Charity Navigator, one of the nation’s largest and most influential charity watchdog organizations, has given the charity a “zero” out of four stars for those same four years.

“It’s a zero-star organization and you can’t go lower than that,” says Michael Thatcher, Charity Navigator’s CEO. “They don’t have an independent board of directors, they actually don’t even have a comprehensive board of directors – only three members on the board at this point in time and some of them are family. So one can say, is this representative of an independent board? It’s not.”

The charity’s most recently filed tax return, for 2014, lists a catalogue of expenses paid for by donations: including $133,000 for travel, $21,000 for unnamed “awards”, $70,000 for a category described as “other expenses” and even a little more than $8,000 for parking.

Charity president works at VA

The CEO and founder of the National Vietnam Veterans Foundation, himself a veteran, is J. Thomas Burch, who is also a federal employee working as an attorney for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Burch is deputy director in the VA’s Office of General Counsel, where he pulled down $127,000 in salary in 2014. That’s the same year he drew a salary of $65,000 as head of his “zero-star” charity.

A VA spokesman told CNN Burch’s position at the veteran’s charity is not a conflict of interest “per se”. But the spokesman added the VA is now “reviewing” the situation and that the agency’s Office of Inspector General is handling that review.

When contacted by CNN, Burch asked that we not contact him at his job at the Department of Veterans Affairs, but he refused to answer phone calls placed to his home. CNN tried to confront Burch as he drove home from work in a black Rolls Royce, but upon seeing a CNN camera crew, Burch gunned the Rolls Royce down his suburban Washington, D.C. street and disappeared.

The charity’s vice president, David Kauffman, said in an email that the NVVF was responsible for “feeding homeless and unemployed veterans by donating to food banks, sent personal care kits to hospitalized veterans and donated blankets, hats and gloves to homeless centers.”

According to the charity’s tax filings, though, it accounted for about $122,000 in cash donations to veterans, out of more than $8.5 million raised in donations in 2014. That is less than 2% of the charities cash donations being used to support veterans and their families.",2016-05-17 10:00:00

64,$116.8 billion. ,http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/16/investing/saudi-arabia-us-debt-ownership-revealed/index.html?sr=fbCNN051716saudi-arabia-us-debt-ownership-revealed0653AMVODtopLink&linkId=24579110,"One of the biggest mysteries in global finance was just revealed: How much U.S. debt Saudi Arabia owns.

Saudi Arabia stockpiled $116.8 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March, the Treasury Department announced on Monday, ending four decades of keeping the figure secret.

That makes Saudi Arabia the 13th largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, though well behind the $1 trillion-plus owned by China and Japan each. The Saudi figure was first reported by Bloomberg News based on a Freedom of Information Act request.

Unlike with most other major owners of U.S. debt, the Treasury Department kept Saudi Arabia's precise holdings secret since the 1970s. Saudi's holdings were lumped together with that of other oil exporting nations, including Venezuela and Iraq.

But that policy ended on Monday as the Treasury Department disclosed precise holdings by specific countries that were previously grouped together. A Treasury official told CNNMoney the move was made following a review aimed at trying to provide more ""comprehensive and transparent"" data.

The new Treasury report also revealed that the Cayman Islands, a country of less than 60,000 people, owned $265 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March. That's the third-highest sum in the world and a reflection of the nation's status as a major tax haven. The Cayman Islands does not have a corporate tax, encouraging multinational companies to store vast sums of money there to avoid taxes.

Likewise, Bermuda, another popular tax haven, is sitting on $63 billion of U.S. debt. Previously both the Cayman Islands and Bermuda were lumped together in a group of Caribbean banking center nations.

It is possible that Saudi Arabia owns even more U.S. debt than what was revealed on Monday. That's because Saudi Arabia's central bank listed owning $587 billion of foreign reserves as of March. Typically, central banks park the majority of their foreign reserves in U.S. Treasuries. In other words, the numbers don't really add up.

One possibility: Saudi Arabia could be taking a page out of China's playbook. Many analysts believe China owns U.S. debt through custodial accounts in Belgium, a relatively tiny country that listed owning over $154 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March.

The Saudi mystery had taken on greater significance in recent months. Since the end of 2014 the Saudis have burned through more than $130 billion of foreign-exchange reserves -- most likely including U.S. debt -- to help cope with the crash in oil prices. The Treasury Department said Saudi Arabia's U.S. debt holdings of $116.8 billion are down from $123.6 billion in January.

Additionally, rising tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia led the kingdom to make a recent shocking threat. Sources told CNN in April that Saudi Arabia threatened to sell off American assets if Congress passed a bill that would allow 9/11 victims to sue foreign governments. A Saudi source at the time told CNNMoney that the kingdom was ""serious"" about this threat.

Dumping a vast sum of U.S. Treasuries at once could cause the securities to tank, potentially destabilizing global financial markets. It could also severely hurt Saudi Arabia's own finances, leading many experts to conclude the threat was empty.",2016-05-17 08:15:00
65,She eats breakfast. ,https://www.newbeauty.com/blog/dailybeauty/9431-the-beauty-product-ivanka-trump-doesnt-use-will-surprise-you/,"Originally Published May 15, 2016

At 34 years old, Ivanka Trump has many titles: wife, mother of three, entrepreneur (she’s launched fashion, jewelry and lifestyle collections, as well as her growing initiative, Women Who Work), writer, and businesswoman. But how does she juggle it all and look so good doing it? Here, she gives us a little glimpse into her world.

NewBeauty: Being that you travel often, especially on the campaign trail, do you have any beauty hacks for busy women who are always on the go?

Ivanka Trump: It’s so important to stay hydrated while traveling. It’s an easy hack, but drinking lots of water really helps you to stay glowing and energized during long trips. When I can, I drink lemon with my water—it dresses it up a little bit!

NB: What is the best beauty tip you’ve learned from your mother?

IT: Take off your makeup before bed, no matter what!! As a teenager, my mother once woke me up in the middle of the night to insist I remove my makeup. She felt like it was terrible for the skin, and I tend to agree.

NB: What do you want to teach your daughter about beauty?

IT: It’s crucial to me to impart to Arabella that confidence, strength and grace are what really makes a woman beautiful. The makeup and skin care are fun, but it’s who you are as a person that matters the most.

NB: As a fan of natural beauty products, are there you swear by that really work?

IT: I’m a big fan of Tata Harper’s Hydrating Floral Essence.

NB: What is one thing people we’d be surprised to learn about you?

IT: I don’t own a blowdryer, and I’ve never learned how to use one. Most days, I walk to work with my hair still slightly wet.

NB: Do you have any post-pregnancy tips for women to bounce back so quickly like you did?

IT: I started thinking more about the nutritional value of food—rather than purely eating for pleasure—during my first pregnancy and have tried to maintain that thinking between my last two pregnancies. I may eat more now (I have even added breakfast, which I always used to skip), but in a healthier way. As far as an exercise routine, I love to run. My team at IvankaTrump.com and I ran a half-marathon last year and I’ve become addicted to the endorphin boost!

NB: You recently spearheaded a major project for the Trump Organization, in which you designed the new Spa Suites at the Trump National Doral Resort & Spa in Miami as part of the property’s $250 million restoration. Are there any design elements in the suites that women can mimic in their own homes?

IT: One of the greatest perks for our Spa Suites guests at Trump National Doral are the in-room offerings, including a bath butler service for a lavishly prepared, unforgettable bath experience. All of the Spa Suites feature deep soaking tubs and women can mimic the experience in their own homes by taking some time out after a long day, drawing a warm bath with aromatherapy salts, lighting a few candles and enjoying a couple minutes of pure relaxation.

NB: Do you have a favorite spa treatment?

IT: As a working mother of three, it’s not often I get to enjoy a spa treatment, but when I do, I love a classic deep tissue massage. This is especially helpful right now, as my neck and back are always sore from carrying around my two toddlers and infant son.

66,They don't feel like their leadership skills are being developed. ,http://www.businessinsider.com/why-millennial-employees-are-quitting-2016-1?utm_content=buffer1f2db&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer,"Two-thirds of millennials plan to leave their current organization by 2020. Flickr/Erin Kelly New research finds two-thirds of millennials plan to leave their current organization by 2020. One-quarter see themselves elsewhere within the next year.

While you could argue that young workers have always been inclined to job hop (and millennials are less inclined to do so), their reasons for restlessness may have changed.

Young workers' latest gripe? Insufficient opportunities to develop their leadership skills.

That's according to the fifth annual Global Millennials survey, cited on Bloomberg, for which Deloitte reached out to nearly 7,700 working college-educated professionals in 29 countries.

As many as 63% of respondents said their leadership skills are not being fully developed.

And it seems to be a key reason behind their willingness to leave: While 71% of those likely to leave in the next two years are dissatisfied with how their leadership skills are being developed, that number drops to 54% among those who are planning to stay beyond 2020.

As Punit Renjen, chief executive officer of Deloitte Global, told Bloomberg, young workers' pursuit of leadership skills even at the expense of switching jobs is a new phenomenon.

Perhaps it has something to do with the recent trend of flattening organizations, which was highlighted in The Washington Post. In an effort to cut costs, organizations have removed levels of bureaucracy, which means there's not much of a corporate ladder to climb anymore.

""The biggest driver of disengagement is people feeling like they're stuck in a job, and there's nothing for them there,"" one expert told The Post. ""It's easier to quit your company and find a new job than find a new job within your own company.""

Restoring some semblance of a corporate ladder may require a good deal of structural reorganization. In the meantime, managers can take small steps to help their employees develop into leadership positions.

The Wall Street Journal recommends creating mentoring programs in which workers are paired with more senior employees at their company. You can also rotate your employees through different jobs, so they gain new knowledge and expertise.

As for individual employees, US News & World Report suggests being proactive instead of waiting for a leadership position to open up.

If you work for a large company, you can speak to someone in human resources and ask what you should be learning to reach the next level. You can also volunteer to take charge of a particular project, so that management recognizes your capabilities.",2016-05-17 06:30:19

",http://www.vice.com/read/immigrants-explain-what-shocked-them-about-american-culture,"I grew up in Australia—a country not unlike the United States—but I was completely floored the first time I visited an American grocery store. In Australia, there are only a few brands of milk, butter, and bread. Milk generally has one ingredient (you know, milk), the cheese isn't fluorescent orange, and bread does not come in a can. In America, options for a single product type barely fit into one aisle. It was my first major experience of culture shock —which can feel like a hurtful reminder that you're not ""home"" anymore.

During one of my first Christmases in America, I remember watching intently as my sister-in-law pulled out a cylinder from the fridge, cracked it open, and scooped sections of white goop onto a baking tray. A few minutes later, steaming rolls emerged.

""It is so frustrating here. Nothing is easy. Nothing is efficient. To pay rent, you have to use a check? I have never written a check. The last time I got a check was maybe 20 years ago, from my granddad. Getting an apartment takes so long as opposed to other countries I have lived in where it's just a handshake. That's it. I went to the post office yesterday, and I was waiting in line for maybe an hour—and there were only five people in front of me. I felt like I went from a Western country to a third-world country. People here with money have access to things. The rest of the people are just trying to survive."" —Robin Zeitoun, 26, welder, French

""I had not seen or even heard of braces before [coming to America]. I had friends in Korea who had really messed up teeth, but it wasn't necessarily seen as any kind of defect. I started seventh grade in the US and several of the kids had braces—the type with wires going across both upper and bottom teeth with a metal holder in front of each tooth. They looked almost like robots. I didn't actually find out what they were until maybe two years or so later, because I didn't have the language skill to ask about them initially. To me, teeth were just what you had. If you had good teeth, you had good teeth. Bad teeth, then bad teeth. It didn't seem like you could move your teeth like that. They felt very solidly planted in my mouth so the entire concept was foreign."" — Chae An, 45, attorney, South Korean

""In the classroom, I experienced a lot of culture shock by how the students interact [with each other] and how they interact with [me, as] the teacher. American kids are very active in the classroom. They even say things before they raise their hand. Students eat in [my] classroom, which is forbidden in China. Often you are rewarded here for being an extrovert. Basically an introvert cannot survive in your classroom. In China, I don't have to clean [my] chalk board. It is the students' responsibility to clean the classroom. In China, teachers are very high ranking. You are very respected. Here, I don't think so. The income is not really above middle class here."" — Niki Xu, 26, math teacher, Chinese

""The whole paper towel thing struck me very strongly as soon as I came to the US. In Korea, paper towels were used for very few selective kitchen tasks, mostly to wipe off oil from frying pans. So I enter a US host family's house and they use paper towels for everything. They don't bother to even keep a rag. It's the same thing with schools—just big rolls of paper towels for when you spill something. But honestly, when I went to Korea last year, I noticed that things have changed. They now have paper towel disposals in a lot of bathrooms."" — Chandra Edwards, 27, financial analyst, South Korean

""Food-wise, I noticed us all getting these round faces from the bad food we ate. We did not realize it, because it was the standard and you think because it's advertised and readily available it can't be bad for you. We were so ignorant coming from South Africa, eating home cooked food every night over there. Then, once we got here, we ate those corn dogs almost every day for lunch, little pizzas for snacks, and sugary cereals for breakfast."" — Ben van den Heever, 32, founder of Brooklyn Biltong, South African

""I was hugely shocked by all the street harassment. And as a queer woman, I didn't realize that I had to police myself in certain areas here. I thought NYC was supposed to be such a gay city, and it is if you're in Manhattan or Chelsea. When I first moved here I remember my girlfriend and I were kissing on the street outside of our apartment in Bushwick and a group of teenagers started yelling and jeering at us. It was kind of scary and very confusing. I've learned not to hold hands or display affection in certain neighborhoods because of it. I don't really travel around the US, but I can tell you I definitely wouldn't hold hands in the south especially with all the crazy anti-LGBT legislation popping up."" — Sarah Barnett, 28, radio reporter, Canadian

""[In conversations with Americans], I feel uncomfortable, like I am not communicating in the right way. I can't conduct a conversation in three minutes. Maybe I take ten minutes. I don't think in English. This is how an immigrant brain works. I talk in my head in Urdu, but then I have to speak in English. I am unable to change myself, because when I came here I was 40. It was in 2010. So do you think that a 40-year-old mature person who spent their adult life doing things one way, you think he can change within three years, five years, six years? Not possible."" — Shahid Khan, 45, community organizer, Pakistani

""I've found Americans to be basically over friendly, which is weird because I'm Canadian and that's our stereotype. I've had cashiers ask how I am—that's normal. But they then ask things like what am I doing that day or something I find way more personal. And I don't know if it's the Canadian in me, but I always give a full answer, so maybe I am engaging too much. I need to learn how to make polite conversation that doesn't make others feel obligated to keep asking questions."" — Allyson Power, 28, student, Canadian

My whole life I believed I was wrong and I would go to hell and I deserved the treatment I got. It was 2011, the first time I enrolled myself to march in the Gay Pride Parade.

68,"Delegate allocations rules were abruptly changed, benefiting Clinton.
",http://www.salon.com/2016/05/16/what_the_hell_just_happened_in_nevada_sanders_supporters_are_fed_up_and_rightfully_so/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=socialflow,"Chaos erupted at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday as supporters of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed over the awarding of the state's 35 pledged delegates. Clinton edged Sanders in the Nevada caucus on Feb. 20th (52.6 percent to 47.3 percent). On April 2, however, the state party held its Clark County convention and Sanders mobilized more delegates than the Clinton campaign (1,613 to 1,298), which swung the delegate count in his favor.

At the state convention this weekend, the final step in the process, Sanders supporters hoped to secure the lion's share of the remaining 12 delegates. Instead, the delegate allocation rules were abruptly changed and Clinton was awarded 7 of the 12 delegates. State party chair, Roberta Lange, told caucus-goers that the “ruling by the Chair is not debatable; we cannot be challenged and I move that...and I announce that the rules have been passed by the body.” Predictably, a chorus of boos followed and the convention was forced to end on a frenzied note.

What happened in Nevada is likely to happen elsewhere. The perception that the DNC has thrown its institutional support behind Clinton has only deepened the internal divide within the party. The Sanders wing is pissed off, and rightfully so.

The establishment support for Clinton was apparent in the superdelegate gap. Superdelegates are a noxious device to begin with, but they're part of the process and, however objectionable Sanders supporters find them, no rules have been broken on that front. In New York, however, where the process wasn't so much rigged as designed to make it uncommonly difficult for non-incumbents or Democratic challengers to compete are problematic at best, particularly in this climate.

Then there's the Hillary Victory Fund, which has become a massive fundraising vehicle for the Clinton campaign. The HVF was created by the DNC and Clinton's super PAC Hillary for America as a means of raising funds both for the Clinton campaign and down-ballot races across the country. Individuals can give over $350,000 to the joint committee if they donate the maximum amount to Clinton, the DNC and the state parties. Federal elections laws, however, do not allow individual donations to specific candidates to exceed $2,700.

The problem, though, as Politico reported two weeks ago, is that Clinton, aided by the DNC, appears to be skirting this rule and funneling large-dollar donations back to her campaign via the HVF. “The victory fund,” the report indicates, “has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but almost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who controls the committee.” At best, this is a violation of the spirit of the elections laws and, more importantly, an affront to Democrats supporting Bernie Sanders.

It's not at all surprising – or wrong, to be fair – that establishment Democrats would support Hillary Clinton. Clinton is a party veteran and a known commodity. She's been at the center of Democratic politics for decades. Sanders, on the other hand, has been an independent for much of his career in the Senate, though he's caucused with the party for years. Sanders is also well to the left of mainstream Democrats, which is part of his appeal with primary voters.

But the Democratic establishment can maintain neutrality in this process without compromising their preferred candidate. The fact is, Clinton has received at least 2.5 million more primary votes than Sanders. She was – and is – likely to win the nomination. There's no need to rig the process or skew the rules in her favor – doing so only adds to the suspicion that the process itself is undemocratic, which is ruinous to the party's long-term viability.

It's still unclear what the hell happened in Nevada. The optics are terrible – that's for sure. Ultimately, the state's few remaining delegates are meaningless and won't alter the dynamics of the race. But the reports are sufficiently murky that both Sanders and Clinton supporters will grow more entrenched as a result of what happened there. That won't hurt the Sanders campaign, but it will undermine the efforts of the DNC and the Clinton campaign to unify the party against the GOP and Donald Trump.",2016-05-16 13:00:00

",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/sophie-gr-goire-trudeau-prompts-debate-in-canada-after-asking-for-more-help-a7031781.html,"The wife of the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has prompted an intense national debate for saying she needs additional staff to help her manage her public duties.

Sophie Grégoire Trudeau told a French-language newspaper based in Quebec that she was keen to do more but she was overwhelmed with work and struggled with just one aid.

“I’d love to be everywhere but I can’t,” she told Le Soleil. “I have three children and a husband who is Prime Minister. I need help. I need a team to help me serve the people.”

Ms Grégoire Trudeau, a 41-year-old former television presenter, said she had been inundated with requests from charities to promote their causes since becoming Canada’s “first lady” but it was not possible for her to respond to everyone.

“It’s hard to choose, because it’s touching when people ask for your help,” she explained. “People really lay out their suffering in some of the letters that I receive. I tell myself: ‘I’ll try to send a message that will reach as many people as possible’.”

Her comments have prompted an onslaught of criticism from opposition politicians who argue she is detached from reality. Conservative Canadian MP Candice Bergen drew attention to the fact the former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's wife, Laureen, had managed with just a single aide. While new democrat MP, Niki Ashton, said she was disconnected from the wider Canadian public.

“Hearing statements like that certainly does not speak to the reality that Canadian women face and the kind of struggles that, you know, that they’re undertaking day in, day out,” Ms Ashton said. “Certainly the kind of statements we heard from the prime minister’s wife, you know, speak to that disconnect with the reality that Canadian women face.”

The issue has been fiercely debated on social media, with the hashtag #jesuissophie and #prayforsophie trending and there has been an onslaught of column pieces exploring the divisive issue.

""If you think Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau shouldn't have help because she 'doesn't have a job', you might want to Google the word 'misogyny',"" wrote one Twitter user.

“Instead of sexist remarks #sophiegregoiretrudeau deserves acclaim + extra help for standing up for women!” added another.

But the majority of Twitter users have been less sympathetic to her situation.

“Dear Sophie when you seek recognition for doing charity, it is not charity at all,” wrote one user.

While another said, “I get she's the PM wife + has demands of her time, but think of any other Cdn woman you know, we all do. And we all deal with it”.

The Prime Minister’s Office have said they are exploring various options for Ms Grégoire Trudeau, including hiring a second staffer for her.",2016-05-16 12:30:00

Cohen, who runs Point72 Asset Management — formerly SAC Capital — picked up the apartment for $24 million in 2005. He hired the late architect Charles Gwathmey to redesign the 9,000-square-foot space, which has five bedrooms and six baths. Located at One Beacon Court — part of the Bloomberg Tower complex — it's in a prime location on the southeast corner of Central Park.

73,"""Walk in like you own the place"". ",http://www.businessinsider.com/former-yum-ceo-david-novak-shares-best-career-advice-for-20-somethings-2016-5,"Yum Brands cofounder and former chairman and CEO David Novak. Hollis Johnson

During his tenure as CEO of Yum Brands from 1999 to 2015, David Novak turned a PepsiCo spinoff into a global leader in the fast-food industry through brands like Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut.

Today, it has 41,000 restaurants across 125 countries and a market capitalization of about $33 billion.

Novak is retiring this month from his role as Yum's executive chairman, but he took time to speak with Business Insider about the lessons he's learned throughout his career.

As he illustrates in his new book, ""O Great One!,"" he considers recognizing great work at Yum to be the foundation for his success, and he advocates that all leaders follow suit.

While it's up to managers to recognize their employees, the employees themselves can boost their chances of being recognized by working to become integral to their company from their first day on the job. It's why he tells all 20-somethings just starting their careers, ""When you go into your job, act like you own the place.""

Entitled 22-year-olds aren't going to win any friends at a company, but Novak isn't recommending that young employees behave arrogantly. Rather, he recommends they integrate themselves into their companies sooner rather than later.

""Don't just go in and do your job,"" he said. ""Think about what your coach ought to be doing, or the CEO ought to be doing. Take as broad a perspective on the company as possible, and always take a company view, not just your job view. And that will demonstrate to other people that you've got potential.""

He said that early in his own career, he would seek opportunities to have conversations with his bosses and tell them three things he'd be working on if he were in their place. It was a bold move for a young employee, but he kept it graceful by making them expressions of his own interest in his team's goals, rather than something patronizing.

Novak said that neophytes needed to understand that the way to get people to teach you is to simply ask them questions, since ""everybody likes to talk about what they've learned.""

He recommended that new employees ""go find the four or five people in the company that you know are really highly respected and go have lunch with them,"" and then ask them about their own careers and how they learned to succeed at the company.

""And they'll take it as a compliment if you seek them out because they're viewed to be so successful and you've heard a lot of good things about them,"" he said.

If 20-somethings can be driven and confident yet also respectful and open to input, they'll become recognized at the company, Novak said. And they shouldn't worry about feeling aggressive.

""A lot of people think that if you do stuff like that you're political,"" he said. ""You're not political. You're just wanting to learn. As long as you're never sacrificing your integrity, don't worry about anything. Just learn.""",2016-05-13 21:54:03

",https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/cliven-bundys-cattle-are-allegedly-still-roaming-unchecked-i?bffbnews&utm_term=.gkNN0w1MJ#.dvQWrQZ7P,"Rob Mrowka, a scientist with the Center for Biological diversity, said the Bundy cattle are essentially ""feral,"" roaming at will over hundreds of thousands of acres — including far outside the range where long ago they were permitted. (Bundy stopped paying his grazing fees in 1993, meaning the cattle were technically trespassing anywhere on public land after that point.)

The area occupied by the cattle is also one of the driest in the U.S., Mrowka said, and the cattle end up out-competing the tortoise for limited food.

""The problem is that the cattle are out there constantly and get first dibs,"" Mrowka added.

Bundy is currently behind bars awaiting trial after being arrested in February at Portland airport on charges stemming from his role in the tense 2014 standoff with federal officials near his Nevada ranch.

Cliven Bundy's lawyer Joel Hansen told BuzzFeed News that there are still cattle on the range, and that ranching operations are being run by Bundy's wife and other women in the family while the rancher awaits trial.

Hansen disagreed that cattle harm tortoise habitat.

""The environmentalists say that it's bad for the tortoise if you have cattle on the land, that's false,"" Hansen said. ""The tortoises do better with the cattle on the land because they like to make a meal out of the cow pies. It's all just environmental hype and it's all for the purpose of getting Mr. Bundy out of there.""",2016-05-13 11:30:00

Reached by TIME Friday, a Guinness World Records spokesperson said the group is beginning to review research and will make an official announcement “in the coming weeks.”

According to the New York Times, which profiled Morano in 2015 when she was 115 years old, her secret to longevity is twofold: raw eggs and no husband. She’s been eating three raw eggs per day since she was a teenager, and as for being single for most of her life: “I didn’t want to be dominated by anyone,” she said.

",http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/israel-forces-palestinians-jerusalem-160504063755669.html,"Jerusalem – Tucked away on a steep, potholed street in Sur Baher, a suburb in the southeastern hills of Jerusalem, Sarah Ali Dwayat’s apartment sits empty.

On the front porch, a large banner bears the photographs of five teenagers from the neighbourhood currently imprisoned by Israel. One of them is her 19-year-old son, Abed.

The group stands accused of throwing stones at Israeli vehicles on a highway, allegedly causing the death of a driver, after clashes between police and Palestinian youths last September, on the eve of the Jewish New Year.

The trial is still going on, but already some of their family members have been forced from their homes – the victims of new measures ostensibly aimed at deterring alleged Palestinian attackers.

“When we got the confiscation notice, we took all the furniture out, and now it’s scattered with friends and neighbours,” Sarah said, pushing back a metal sheet covering one window to sneak a look inside.

Doorknobs to the home have been broken off, and entrances sealed with melted metal plates. Sarah, a widow for 15 years, and her 24-year-old daughter have moved to a smaller apartment in the same area, provided by a neighbour as a goodwill gesture.

Sooner or later, they will have to start paying rent again, Sarah acknowledged – and with property prices sky-high in Jerusalem, they will not be able to afford it. “We had just started renovation work. Abed had found a job and had started to help. We are still paying the debts,” Sarah, 59, told Al Jazeera.

“When they came to seal the house [last month], a soldier told me, in Arabic, that it was to send a message to others, so they wouldn’t carry out more acts of terror.”

Since last October, tensions have boiled over into violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the blockaded Gaza Strip.

During this period, the Israeli army has killed at least 206 Palestinians, including protesters, bystanders and alleged attackers, while 33 Israelis have been killed in stabbing and shooting incidents.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a series of measures directed at alleged Palestinian attackers and their families, including the demolition or sealing of attackers’ homes and the revocation of permanent residency status for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem.

Munir Nusseibeh, a human rights lawyer and director of the Community Action Centre at al-Quds University, believed that Sarah’s son and two of his co-accused, Muhammad Abu Kaf, 17, and Mustafa Atrash, 18, were “test cases”. Israel’s interior minister issued a decision to strip all three of their Jerusalem residency in January, a move that is now being appealed in court.

“They are the first at risk of residency revocation for throwing stones, and the first whose families have been displaced from their homes for throwing stones,” Nusseibeh told Al Jazeera.

Allegiance, which allegiance? We pay tax to the Israeli municipality, and we get nothing in return. Did Yigal Amir get his citizenship revoked for killing the prime minister of Israel? by Abu Walid, father of Mustafa Atrash, who is on trial over stone-throwing allegations

A letter to Abed’s lawyer from the Israeli Interior ministry states that “a permanent residency status in Israel is based on a material connection between the resident and the state” and that it “requires basic commitment and loyalty in view of the fact that residency, and all the more so permanent residency, is not a status which only grants rights without any obligations”.

When Israel occupied and unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, Palestinians were designated as “permanent residents” rather than citizens of the state, a status akin to that of migrants in a foreign country. Since then, over 14,000 have had their residency revoked.

Over the years, the criteria for revoking residency have broadened. Two decades ago, Israel’s interior ministry revoked the residency of Palestinians who lived abroad for seven or more years, or who obtained residency or citizenship status in another country.

But after the Oslo Accords, a new policy was introduced whereby Palestinians would lose residency rights if they established their “centre of life” outside of Israel – such as in the West Bank or Gaza. Some 11,000 out of the 14,000 had their residency revoked under this policy.

In 2006, three elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council had their Jerusalem residency revoked on new grounds: “breach of allegiance to the state”. Their case is still pending before the Supreme Court.

“No one was arguing that these parliamentarians posed a specific security threat to Israel, but rather it was because of their political belonging that they decided to cancel their right to live in Jerusalem,” Nusseibeh said, noting that there are 13 known cases of residency revocation under the allegiance criteria.

“If the Supreme Court approves the residency revocations in the 2006 case based on breach of allegiance, this will make a new important precedent – it will be the first time that the Supreme Court approves revoking residency based on political, rather than security reasons,” Nusseibeh said.

“All Palestinians in Jerusalem will be at risk of residency revocation according to the allegiance criteria, because Palestinians in East Jerusalem see the occupation as temporary and Israel as a foreign occupying power.”

Abu Walid, the father of Mustafa Atrash, was indignant at this policy. “Allegiance, which allegiance? We pay tax to the Israeli municipality, and we get nothing in return,” he told Al Jazeera. “Did Yigal Amir get his citizenship revoked for killing the prime minister of Israel?” he added, referring to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a right-wing Israeli extremist in 1995.





Abir Joubran-Dakwar, a lawyer for the Israeli human rights organisation Hamoked who is working on the Sur Baher case, noted that there are a number of specific criteria under which citizenship can be revoked, including “breach of allegiance”.

However, this does not apply to residency, she said: “A person who has his citizenship revoked becomes stateless, but the interior ministry will still have to give him a permanent residency status.”

Israel’s interior ministry did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the matter.

At the end of April, Israel’s attorney-general temporarily suspended the revocation in the Sur Baher case, until the Supreme Court comes to a decision in the 2006 case.

Human rights groups, including B’Tselem, have argued in the past that home demolitions, denial of building permits, restrictions on family reunification, and the building of the separation wall are all among the variety of methods used by Israel to forcibly displace Palestinians and maintain a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, in violation of international law.

“I believe the aim of this policy is to add a new method for the displacement of Palestinians in East Jerusalem, to be able to displace even larger numbers,” Nusseibeh said. “That’s our concern.”",2016-05-12 22:59:49

79,"It depends on where it's purchased. If it's purchased in Florida, then it's an in-state private purchase and would not be subject to a background check. ",http://ti.me/1T8RD1F,"The gun George Zimmerman used in 2012 to kill Trayvon Martin showed up on two separate online gun sales sites Thursday. But do online sales mean it wouldn’t go through a standard background check? That all depends on where it’s purchased, gun experts say.

Zimmerman initially listed the handgun that he used to kill Martin, a black 17-year-old in Sanford, Fla., on gunbroker.com, along with a note saying he would dedicate some of the proceeds to fighting “BLM violence against Law Enforcement officers,” presumably referring to the Black Lives Matter movement. But the gun sale website quickly removed the listing. Zimmerman then posted a listing for the gun on unitedgungroup.com, a similar online gun sales site. No matter which site Zimmerman uses to sell the gun, the purchaser’s location will determine whether a background check will be performed.

Gun sales websites aren’t allowed to sell guns directly to people, but instead bring buyers and sellers together. They also don’t conduct background checks or directly transport firearms to purchasers, says Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who studies gun policy.

“There is no such thing as an online gun sale,” Volokh says, referring to the limits placed on sites that arrange gun sales.

If the gun is purchased by somebody in Florida, where Zimmerman lives, it would be considered an in-state private purchase and would not be subject to a background check. Neither federal nor Florida law requires checks for in-state transactions.

“What’s often misunderstood is that this is some kind of loophole,” says Dave Kopel, an associate policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. “But it’s the same rules for online sales. It varies state by state, but in most you can sell private-to-private within the state.”

If the purchaser is from out of state, however, federal law requires that the seller ship the firearm to a licensed gun dealer in the purchaser’s state. That dealer will then run a background check in the same manner as any other gun purchase from a dealer.

“This works quite routinely in far less lurid contexts,” Volokh says.

Zimmerman was acquitted in Martin’s death in 2013 but has had a series of run-ins with police since then. He was arrested on assault charges in January 2015 and has had multiple confrontations with Matthew Apperson, who was accused of shooting and injuring Zimmerman in May 2015.

80,"Maybe, but probably not. They have to do ""research."" ",http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/12/did-pope-francis-just-pave-the-way-for-women-priests.html,"ROME — At what was meant to be a love fest for 900 nuns at a meeting of the International Union of Superiors General at the Vatican on Thursday, Pope Francis didn’t just rock the boat; he may have created a tidal wave.

During the question and answer session of the meeting, one of the sisters at the conference brought up the fact that women had served as deacons in the early church.

Then, according to the National Catholic Reporter, she asked the pope, “Why not construct an official commission that might study the question?”

Francis then said that he had discussed the matter of those early deaconesses with a professor several years earlier, but that he remained unclear about what role they actually served.

“What were these female deacons?” Francis said he asked the professor, according to the National Catholic Reporter. “Did they have ordination or no? It was a bit obscure. What was the role of the deaconess in that time?”

Then, apparently thinking out loud, he endorsed the idea.

“Constituting an official commission that might study the question?” Francis asked. “I believe yes. It would do good for the church to clarify this point. I am in agreement. I will speak to do something like this.”

The pope went on to address other concerns from the group of sisters, and dole out advice like “take a deep breath” and “get more sleep” and then revisited the topic. “I accept,” the pope said. “It seems useful to me to have a commission that would clarify this well.”

Deacons in the Catholic context act as a sort of priest-lite: they cannot perform the sacrament of the Eucharist (give holy communion) and they don’t have to take the vow of celibacy; in fact many are married. But they can perform any number of ministerial roles, from baptisms to funerals, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops website, which is something many of the world’s Catholics just might appreciate.

Quoting canon 1024 of the Code of Canon Law, Catholic website Crux points out that at the moment, “only a baptized male can receive the sacrament of ordination, so the law does not presently permit female deacons.” Crux editors then question whether Francis will change the law, which is within his powers as pope.

As exciting as this is for roughly one half of the world’s Catholic population (the female half), surely not everyone will be pleased at the idea of women nudging one step closer to the all-male clergy club that rules the Catholic Church.

Almost immediately, liberal priests tweeted their praise. Father James Martin, a prolific author priest from New York, tweeted that the news filled him with “immense joy” and that, “Women deacons would be able to baptize, preside at marriages and funerals, and preach at Mass. It would be an immense gift to the church.”

A more conservative priest tweeted, “Has @Pontifex forgotten about this 2002 study about diaconate where issue of women deacons was examined?” referring to a Vatican study that all but nixed the idea.

Even if the special commission Pope Francis promised today does pave the way to the ordination of women deacons, they may never have a hope in Hell of being allowed to enter the full priesthood. But they are certainly one step closer than they have ever been before.",2016-05-12 08:17:29

Only a year ago, a study out of Stony Brook University in New York found that age 60 should be considered the new middle age.

Not surprisingly, age plays a role in one's perceptions. Among those Marist respondents who are 45 and older, 63 percent are more likely than younger respondents to think of 65 as middle-aged. When it comes to those younger than 45, 49 percent believe 65 is old while 47 percent refer to it as middle-aged. For those under 30, 60 percent consider 65 to be old. The Marist poll involved 1,297 adults surveyed over the phone in late March.

Researchers have said that people are hitting middle age later in life simply because they are living longer than ever before.
