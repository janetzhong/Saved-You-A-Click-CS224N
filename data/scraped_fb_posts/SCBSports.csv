Unfortunately, he‚Äôll have to wait at least one more year to witness that.

The NFC will either be represented by the Los Angeles Rams or San Francisco 49ers this season.

During an appearance on ‚ÄòK&C Masterpiece‚Äô on 105.3 The Fan, Jones revealed which team he‚Äôs rooting for this weekend.

Not only does Jones want the Rams to win the NFC, he wants to see them hoist the Lombardi Trophy. That‚Äôs because SoFi Stadium was built right near his childhood home.

‚ÄúThere is such a romance to me for the Los Angeles Rams to be sitting here playing the NFC Championship Game in that new stadium, and then to turn around and potentially play in the Super Bowl there,‚Äù said Jones on 105.3 The Fan, via Audacy. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre about one mile from the little house my parents lived in when I was born ‚Äì I was born right there. I have a lot of relatives out there.

‚ÄúThere is so much of me that would like to see that fairytale here. This is the first real big year for them to be operating in that stadium. We have our media headquarters out there. That just looks like the Hollywood sign that used to be on that mountain. That was the city of entertainment for the world. Now, we see that beautiful stadium, and I‚Äôm excited about that. So I‚Äôm rooting for them.‚Äù

The Rams are coming into this weekend with a lot of confidence. Last Sunday, they knocked off the Buccaneers on the road.

Josh Allen set the tone for the Bills this past Sunday well before Buffalo‚Äôs offense took its first snap against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium.

In the morning leading up to the Week 16 AFC East showdown, Allen informed teammates that he woke up with ‚Äúviolence‚Äù on his mind. The star quarterback‚Äôs outlook, as wideout Isaiah McKenzie explained to NBC Sports‚Äô Peter King after the game, resonated with the Bills.

‚ÄúHis point in saying he woke up with violence on his mind was we gotta come out and play every play like it‚Äôs the most important play,‚Äù McKenzie told King. ‚ÄúAnd we felt that from the first play of the game.‚Äù

Allen looked like a man possessed in Foxboro. The fourth-year pro had his way with New England‚Äôs defense, throwing for 314 yards with three touchdowns while also pacing Buffalo in rushing yards with 64. Allen‚Äôs stellar performance helped the Bills secure a 33-21 win, which vaulted Buffalo back into first place in the AFC East.

McKenzie certainly took Allen‚Äôs message to heart. The speedy slot wideout put together the game of his life, racking up 11 catches for 125 yards with a touchdown. McKenzie‚Äôs breakout game couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time for the Bills, who were without top WRs Cole Beasley and Gabriel Davis.

6,They brought their own benches with them. ,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-make-unexpected-move-before-game-with-washington-ron-rivera-warns-his-team-to-not-fall-for-mind-games/,"There's one thing the Week 14 matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Football Team won't lack, and that's drama. One of the longest and most toxic rivalries in the NFL reignites for 2021 when the former takes their talents to FedEx Field on Sunday, and amid a fiery public exchange of words between the team's head coaches. Mike McCarthy expressed the ultimate ""confidence"" in his gameplan to go into Maryland and win, his comments meeting the ire of Ron Rivera, who labeled them a ""big mistake.""

That was far from the end of their exchange though, the media serving as a messenger service between Dallas and Greater Landover this week. On Friday, McCarthy was asked about Rivera's distaste for his initial comment, and he didn't pull any punches.

""The conversation we had in [Thursday's press conference], we were talking about a number of different things,"" said McCarthy. ""I think when you come out of a bye weekend, just like comments that are made, context is important. And I think sometimes that gets lost. But it's irrelevant what anybody thinks, anybody thinks about what I said in here yesterday. I was talking about my team.

""I can always coach my own team. And that's where I'm at with it.""

The temperature between the two rivals spiked further when owner Jerry Jones tagged in and jumped off of the top rope.

""We have always sold more Cowboys hats, caps, T-shirts, we've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington,"" Jones told 105.3FM the Fan. ""That's outside the Dallas area -- outside the Texas area -- Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count.""

Despite there being a large element of fact in what Jones said, it sparked an even taller storm surge during what's labeled as ""Dallas week"" in the nation's capital, but it's what Jones did two days later that's truly turning the screws. The Hall of Fame owner flew in the Cowboys benches to have them placed on Dallas' sideline on Sunday, a first time for any opponent entering FedEx Field.

Let the games begin.

Now, it's entirely possible this wasn't merely intended to be a slight from Jones to a franchise that, if they had their way, wouldn't have allowed the Cowboys into the NFL in the first place (back in the late 1950s). Apparently, the Seattle Seahawks (who lost to Washington at FedEx Field in Week 12) tipped off Jones to issues with the hotseat benches on the visitor's sideline in the stadium, per Todd Archer of ESPN, detailing how they'd routinely go out during the game, so Jones decided to ship his own to prevent that from being an issue.

Temperatures are expected to be in the mid-40s at kickoff, per Weather.com, so Jones made the call.

The Cowboys are 8-4 after stumbling mightily in November and then handing the New Orleans Saints a loss at Caesars Superdome to begin the all-important month of December, but Rivera has Washington on a red-hot four-game win streak that puts them at 6-6 and back in the playoff hunt. Their battle on Sunday will be the first of the season and is not only critical for both clubs, but will also set the tone for their second matchup to come in two weeks from today. Rivera is hoping to upset the Cowboys and not only send a message to the NFL that his team could make waves going forward, but also as a means of shoving McCarthy's and Jones' foot into their respective mouths.

Of course, the latter two want nothing more than to do the same to Rivera, who has also reportedly held a meeting to advise his players to not fall for any perceived psychological tactics being deployed this week by the Cowboys, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network. It could be argued that Rivera having that conversation means they've already allowed the Cowboys into their mental space, but ultimately it'll come down to what happens on the field that decides this game, and the NFC East.

To that point, the Cowboys are seeing a surge of reinforcements return in Week 14 while Washington is forced to be without a slew of key players due to a combination of injury and COVID-19. If Rivera is going to stun Dallas, he's going to have to hope they're not on their best game -- i.e., overconfident -- and that his squad steps up to show McCarthy and Jones why words and flown-in benches don't matter.

As for the Cowboys, well, the benches can't be the only thing on their sideline that heats up on Sunday.",Cowboys make unexpected move before game with Washington; Ron Rivera warns his team to not fall for mind games,2021-12-12 08:20:44
7,IND 41 - 15 BUF It's the 1070th unique final score in NFL history. ,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/colts-upset-win-over-bills-ends-with-final-score-thats-never-been-seen-before-in-nfl-history/,"For the second time in the 2021 NFL season, the Indianapolis Colts found themselves involved in an NFL rarity: A Scorigami.

If you're not familiar with Scorigami, it's pretty simple: The internet cheers when the NFL gives us a final score that's never been seen before and that's what the Colts' 41-15 upset win over the Bills gave us during Week 11.

Scorigami has grown so much on Twitter that the Colts even made note of the fact that they hit the unique score in the win.

The idea of tracking every Scorigami was created by SB Nation writer Jon Bois and there's now a Twitter account with more than 275,000 followers that tracks each and every Scorigami.

The Scorigami Twitter account should probably dedicate this week's Scorigami to Jonathan Taylor and that's because he scored five touchdowns in the win.

The Colts victory marked the NFL's fourth Scorigami of the season and the SECOND one by Indy. The Colts also had a Scorigami back in Week 9 when they beat the Jets 45-30. The first one of the year came back in Week 6 when the Rams beat the Giants 38-11. Arizona and Houston also had a Scorigami in Week 7 when the Cardinals beat the Texans 31-5.

In the Colts' win over the Bills, the Scorigami almost didn't happen. Going into the fourth quarter, the Colts were ahead 38-7 and if that had been the final score, that wouldn't have been a Scorigami because it's happened 45 times in NFL history.

Early in the fourth quarter, the score changed when Josh Allen hit Stefon Diggs for a touchdown. After the score, the Bills also hit on the two-point conversion to make it 38-15. Although that score is rare, it has happened five times before in NFL history, so that wouldn't have been a Scorigami, either. The Scorigami wasn't locked in until Michael Badgley hit a 35-yard field goal with over six minutes left to make it 41-15.

The Colts then picked off Mitchell Trubisky late in the game to seal the Scorigami. And that's how you get a unique score for the 1,070th time in NFL history.

This has been a surprisingly slow year for Scorigamis with only four. Last year, there were a total of 12 on the season. Of course, it's not surprising to see fewer Scorigamis and that's because every time one hits, that's one final-score option that's taken off the table.

Brady has made plenty of rivals since joining the NFL in 2000. The Miami Dolphins have always given him trouble, the Kansas City Chiefs were responsible for his torn ACL, and the Indianapolis Colts and Peyton Manning always provided must-see television.

Beating those teams was likely satisfying, but there's one team Brady enjoys beating even more. If you think about Brady's career for a few seconds, you can probably guess which one.

Yeah, it's the New York Giants.

Brady revealed that tidbit on his podcast ""Let‚Äôs Go! With Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald and Jim Gray.‚Äù Why the Giants? The Super Bowl losses, of course.

Here's Brady's answer, per NBC Sports.

‚ÄúHoly cow, that‚Äôs a good question,"" Brady said. ""The team I would love to beat the most is the Giants, there‚Äôs no doubt about that, because they‚Äôve taken away some really, you know ‚Äî I‚Äôve always joked with Eli [Manning] but, yeah, and I think he likes that I bring it up all the time. So to bring it up again, I do not like losing to those guys, so when we beat them I love that.""

The choice is understandable. Two of the biggest losses of Brady's career came against the Giants. The two times Brady played the team in the Super Bowl, he lost.

The regular season is a different story. Brady is 5-1 against the Giants. He's thrown eight touchdowns and four interceptions in those games.

Tom Brady praises Patriots after beating them in Week 4

Brady took things a step further and told Gray which team he enjoys beating the least. It's easy to assume Brady harbors bad blood against the Patriots, but that's not the case. He admitted he enjoyed beating his former team the least.

Brady explained it was tough to face off against former teammates.

""And the team I like to beat the least is obviously the Patriots. Again, those are my guys, man. Those are the other warriors that I went to battle with for so long. I‚Äôve had a lot of battles over the years with different teams, there‚Äôs a lot of mutual respect in pro sports, but glad I‚Äôm through with the one last night.‚Äù

Sunday's win might have been bittersweet, but Brady can offset that feeling in a few weeks.

Trust me... I know from experience.

And the same goes for Ryan Fitzpatrick, the longtime quarterback who's beloved by fans and players alike but had one innocent gesture that didn't quite turn out the way he had planned. He shared a story about a message he sent to Alex Smith on the ""Green Light with Chris Long"" podcast.

""He was picked No. 1, I was pick No. 250, but he was always really nice to me going through the (draft) process and I've always appreciated him over the years,"" Fitzpatrick said, referring to their 2005 NFL Draft class. ""When Alex broke his leg in that game a few years ago, I had a what I thought was similar injury. I fractured my tibia in 2014 with the Houston Texans and so the single-worst... text I've ever sent out, I sent to Alex.

""And I said, 'hey Alex, just want to let you know they'll fix you right up, you'll be good as new... I'm out here and I don't feel any pain from my injury three years later,' or whatever, whenever it was. And I sent it and felt good about it. And he said, 'Oh, mine might be a little more complicated.' And 17 surgeries later and the story of what he had to overcome, I mean, I felt like the biggest a------ ever.

""...But what he did last year was, it was incredible for him to get back on the field and I was very happy after sending that text that he didn't lose his leg.""

Smith's miraculous recovery story was one of the defining moments ‚Äî perhaps the defining moment ‚Äî of the 2020 NFL season, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it was easy for everyone to watch. In fact, it was quite the opposite, and Smith remembers just how poor the conditions were for such a return.

""I think the first [game] that he got put in was against the Rams and it was just images of Aaron Donald jumping on his back and him sitting there having to hold Aaron Donald on his back, and [he] got sacked a bunch that game, and it was pouring rain, and it just seemed like it was a miserable experience,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""I don't want to speak for Alex, but I'll say that I assume that it was such a huge personal challenge for him just to prove that he could do it, that he could come all the way back, and I think it was a really inspirational story for a lot of people watching him do that.""

Smith won Comeback Player of the Year, leading the Washington Football Team to a 5-1 record in his six starts and leading the league in passing yards (390) in just his first start of the season. The fact that he returned from an injury that threatened not only his leg but his whole life was a remarkable way for him to cap off an excellent career.

With it, Locastro broke the Major League Baseball record for most successful stolen bases to start a career. Since making his MLB debut in 2017 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, he's gone 28 for 28 on his stolen base attempts. His mark of 28 stolen bases passes Hall of Famer Tim Raines, who stole 27 in a row from 1979-81. Records for successful stolen bases attempts have been kept since 1951.

Here's a look at stolen base No. 28:

Locastro, 28, will send his cleats that he wore for the record-breaker to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

The grounds crew at Chase Field retrieved it, and the base was authenticated.

Locastro gave his mom the base after the game:

Locastro's impact wasn't limited to the base paths in the D-Backs' 8-3 win over the Reds. He hit in the leadoff spot (for the third consecutive game) and finished with four singles, two runs scored and the record-breaking stolen base.

14,"Doctors found a blood clot in his lung and were able to treat it successfully.
",https://yhoo.it/2QbpT3y,"NCAA basketball official Bert Smith hasn't watched the moment that might have saved his life.

Smith abruptly collapsed during an Elite Eight game between No. 1 seed Gonzaga and No. 6 seed USC last month in the men's NCAA tournament. It was a scary moment as an audible thud was heard throughout Lucas Oil Stadium, and the official was taken off the court on a stretcher, though he was awake and alert.

Smith told the Indianapolis Star's Gregg Doyel he doesn't remember falling and hasn't seen a replay, but what doctors found that night could have been life-saving.

NCAA ref on stretcher photo

Smith, who became an NCAA Division I official in 1993, said he remembers the play preceding the fall. The action was moving away from his baseline position after a Gonzaga steal, but he said he couldn't move or catch his breath. He felt wobbly and the next thing he remembers seeing is the ceiling of the stadium.

Immediately after falling, Gonzaga assistant coach Tommy Lloyd ran to him and the bench waved for doctors. He was surrounded by medical professionals and eventually was helped on to a stretcher.

He's grumpy in the now-famous photo of him on it and told Doyel he was tricked.

‚ÄúThe doctor said, ‚ÄòListen, tell you what, why don‚Äôt you just sit on the stretcher?‚Äô I said OK, I can do that,‚Äù Smith says and now he‚Äôs laughing. To me, he offers an aside: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking advantage of a guy in a weakened position.‚Äù

He continues the story:

‚ÄúThe doc says, ‚ÄòSwing your legs around.‚Äô I swing my legs around, and they go: Click-click-click-click. They strapped me in! I looked at him and said, ‚ÄòOh no you didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù

He said he told the doctor at the time, ""You little SOB, you tricked me!‚Äù

Fall could have saved official's life

The NCAA announced later in the night that Smith was ""alert and stable"" and would not be transported to a hospital. Per the Star, he was treated at the stadium for two hours with vital checks on pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level that came back normal. He didn't have a headache or blurry vision.

Story continues

A few hours later, his officiating friends joined him at the hotel and suggested he go to the hospital to be evaluated for a concussion, just in case. At IU Health Methodist, the 56-year-old Smith was treated by Dr. Katie Trammel, ""an important part of this story.""

Via the Star:

‚ÄúShe sits down next to the bed,‚Äù Smith continues, ‚Äúand she says: ‚ÄòI saw your fall tonight. Something doesn‚Äôt add up. I want to know why you fell.‚Äô She checked a few things out, came back in and took me through the car wash. Just a lot of tests. And they found out.

‚ÄúShe said: ‚ÄòI got the answer to the question. You went down because you had a blood clot in your lung.‚Äô‚Äù

Smith‚Äôs pausing. Dr. Katie Trammel, he‚Äôs wanting me to know, may have saved his life.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know where that clot was going next,‚Äù he says.

Smith was put on blood thinners and discharged two days later with the clot gone. No one knows where the clot came from, per the Star. He said the night before the game, while running the stairs in the hotel to see his buddies or get ice, he was a little out of breath. He gets exercise any time he can and officiates around 90 games a year for the NCAA.

It could have been a red flag, he said doctors told him, but then again ""sometimes it just hits you.""

Smith is back home in Kentucky with his wife, Jacquie, and his grandson, Karter. He said he'll be back officiating next season. He told the Star he's happy it happened during the Elite Eight when he could get the right help he needed rather than during an instance when he was driving or sleeping.

16,"The Patriot League hasn't played many non-conference games so they're a mathematical outlier.
",https://sports.yahoo.com/how-ncaa-rankings-have-tiny-colgate-ahead-of-a-handful-of-powerhouses-221121339.html?ncid=facebook_yahoosport_l0w2dc1068w,"The top seven teams in the NCAA‚Äôs NET rankings include unbeaten Gonzaga, one-loss Baylor and a trio of Big Ten heavyweights with national title aspirations.

Then there‚Äôs No. 8: A small-conference afterthought that has never won an NCAA tournament game in program history, nor even once appeared in the AP Top 25.

How is Colgate ‚Äî the No. 2 seed in this week‚Äôs Patriot League tournament ‚Äî ranked ahead of 2019 national champ Virginia, blue blood Kansas and powerhouses Ohio State and Villanova? Even the coach of the Raiders didn‚Äôt see this coming.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mathematical outlier,‚Äù Matt Langel told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an interesting tidbit in what has been the craziest college basketball season in my lifetime.‚Äù

The explanation for Colgate‚Äôs top-10 NET ranking begins with the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äôs impact on the Patriot League‚Äôs schedule. The league did not allow six of its eight teams to start their seasons until Jan. 2. Only Army and Navy were exempt and had permission to schedule games in November and December.

As a result of that decision, the totality of the Patriot League‚Äôs non-league schedule this season consists of nine games involving either Army or Navy. Army went 4-1 including a narrow loss to Florida and an impressive win over mid-major power Buffalo. Navy went 3-1 including an upset of Georgetown.

In a normal year, the NET rankings ‚Äî a metric created to help select and seed NCAA tournament hopefuls ‚Äî would evaluate the strength of the Patriot League on the results of roughly 100 non-conference games. In this pandemic year, only nine data points are available. Army and Navy outperforming expectations in those nine games is dramatically warping the NET‚Äôs perception of the league as a whole.

‚ÄúBasically, Colgate and the Patriot League are a closed system,‚Äù college basketball analytics expert Bart Torvik told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúYou can't really use results from just this year with no priors of any kind and compare those teams against the rest of D-I because there‚Äôs no connectedness.‚Äù

Story continues

(Michael Wagstaffe/Yahoo Sports illustration)

Colgate has soared higher in the NET rankings than its Patriot League peers because of its 12-1 record and impressive margin of victory. Because the Patriot League broke its teams into three divisions to help limit travel, Colgate has only played three opponents: Army, Boston University and Holy Cross. The Raiders‚Äô lone loss came by two against Army. They won the rest of their games by an average of nearly 19 points apiece.

‚ÄúWhen you beat your opponents by such a huge margin, that shows up,‚Äù said data scientist Ed Feng, founder of The Power Rank.

While it‚Äôs theoretically possible that the Patriot League could produce a team worthy of a high ranking, recent history suggests it‚Äôs unlikely. Only twice in the 2000s has the Patriot League‚Äôs NCAA tournament entrant received better than a No. 13 seed. The league has not produced an NCAA tournament victory since 15th-seeded Lehigh toppled mighty Duke in 2012.

Other respected college basketball analytics experts have avoided overrating the Patriot League this season by incorporating data from previous years into their rankings. The assumption that the league would have performed at its recent average level in non-conference play makes a huge difference.

Colgate is 80th in Torvik‚Äôs tempo-free rankings. Ken Pomeroy has the Raiders 89th.

‚ÄúThe preseason weighting helps anchor the Patriot League in a more realistic way,‚Äù Pomeroy told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúThe weighting only applies to cases where teams have played few games, so it influences the Patriot League while not being a factor for the vast majority of teams at this point.‚Äù

While the NCAA‚Äôs algorithm does not include data from previous seasons, Colgate‚Äôs top-10 NET ranking isn‚Äôt likely to dramatically alter the selection committee‚Äôs perception of the Raiders. NCAA spokesman David Worlock cautioned that the NET is ‚Äújust one tool‚Äù and that ‚Äúother metrics and criteria factor into the committee‚Äôs decision for selecting and seeding teams.‚Äù

Many mock NCAA tournament brackets project Colgate as a No. 13 or 14 seed if it wins this week‚Äôs Patriot League tournament. The Raiders received a No. 15 seed two years ago and lost a first-round matchup to Tennessee.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to get a seed that is similar to where our NET ranking is or even close,‚Äù Langel said, ‚Äúbut my hope is that maybe we can bump up a spot or two.‚Äù

The most tangible impact of Colgate‚Äôs high NET ranking is that Langel‚Äôs phone has rung more often than usual the past few weeks. Coaches of teams on the NCAA tournament bubble keep calling to try to hastily arrange a game.

Stoppages and outbreaks caused an unusual number of teams to scramble to fill holes in their schedules. What better way to do that than by scheduling the Raiders in hopes of earning a r√©sum√©-boosting Quadrant 1 victory without having to beat a traditional power?

‚ÄúI fielded a number of calls from bubble teams as the season was winding down,‚Äù Langel said. ‚ÄúMy angle was to try to get them to come here. I think a testament to our team is that nobody really had a lot of interest in doing that. They wanted to play us, but they wanted to play us in their venue.‚Äù

Colgate‚Äôs top-10 NET ranking has also garnered attention from coaches eager to assess how the Raiders did it. They all want to know if this is strictly a COVID anomaly or if there‚Äôs a lesson to be learned in how to game the NET in the future.

Among those qualified to answer that question is Matt Dover, co-owner of an analytics company that helps coaches optimize their non-league schedules to maximize their chances of making the NCAA tournament. It‚Äôs Dover‚Äôs belief that this is simply a ‚Äúweird artifact of a weird season‚Äù ‚Äî not a loophole to be exploited again and again.

‚ÄúThe NET is built to be pretty hard, if not impossible to game, under normal circumstances,‚Äù Dover told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúThis is just a unique situation caused by the Patriot League playing so few non-conference games. That is leaving the entire league vulnerable to huge statistical swings that there won‚Äôt be in future years.‚Äù

Could another one-bid league gamble, only play a handful of strategically selected non-league games and hope to outperform expectations the way Army and Navy did this season? In theory, maybe. In reality, too many small-conference teams rely on the revenue generated by playing road non-conference games in return for tens of thousands of dollars.

‚ÄúWhat are they going to do?‚Äù Dover said. ‚ÄúTotally forgo the option of playing those? Because that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd have to do. You‚Äôd have to limit it to a tiny, tiny sample size. Once you get up to a slightly larger sample size ‚Äî every team playing a few non-conference games for example ‚Äî it would be much less likely you‚Äôd get something super skewed.‚Äù

Yet Reid, the son of Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, remains a free man, still awaiting a Kansas City police investigation to determine whether he‚Äôll face charges.

That continued uncertainty has frustrated many, who in the meantime have followed what remains an ominous prognosis for the 5-year-old girl who was in the backseat of one of the hit vehicles and critically injured during the crash.

Ariel Young woke up from a coma last month. That‚Äôs about the only positive news. Her family and their attorney report she remains unresponsive and can neither speak nor walk.

‚ÄúShe likely has permanent brain damage that she will endure for the rest of her life,‚Äù Tom Porto, the family‚Äôs attorney told ABC.

‚ÄúShe is not the same happy, free-spirited little girl she was before this horrific crash,‚Äù her aunt Tiffany Velhurst wrote on a GoFundMe page that is attempting to raise money for the family.

Kansas City Police told Yahoo Sports on Tuesday that the investigation into the incident is ongoing and there are no updates.

KCPD originally stated that similar cases take at least 1-2 months, as it awaits toxicology reports and further investigation. That timetable is still in play. Toxicology results alone in Jackson County, Missouri can sometimes take three months to be returned, according to locals with knowledge of the system.

According to a search warrant to draw blood from Reid, the 35-year-old acknowledged to officers on the scene that he had consumed 2-3 drinks prior to driving and was taking prescription Adderall. He was not arrested on the scene for suspicion of drunk driving or any charge.

The fact Reid was taken to an area hospital, where he underwent surgery for injuries sustained in the crash, may have played a part in that decision. While the lengthy delay in charges remains a topic of discussion, police and independent local defense attorneys say this is standard operating procedure, particularly for a high-profile case involving a critical injury.

Story continues

‚ÄúWhile many point to alleged statements made by Mr. Reid to law enforcement as a reason to charge, this was a devastating incident with catastrophic consequences,‚Äù said Chris Scott of the Christopher Scott Law Office in Kansas City.

Scott does not represent Britt Reid, but both as a former county prosecutor and now a defense attorney, he has extensive background in DUI cases.

‚ÄúLaw enforcement needs as much information as possible before turning the investigation over to prosecutors for a charging decision,‚Äù Scott said. ‚ÄúIt could be more than just toxicology results they are waiting for. There could be accident reconstruction taking place, other witnesses needing to be tracked down, or other issues they need to resolve.‚Äù

As for a timetable, no one can reasonably know. Police have asked for patience and continue to stress they are doing what they can.

‚ÄúIf toxicology reports are pending, those could come in tomorrow or take weeks or months to come back,‚Äù Scott said.

Then and only then will local prosecutors decide whether to pursue charges.

‚ÄúUltimately, he will only be arrested if criminal charges are filed,‚Äù Scott said.

In a statement last month following the crash, the Chiefs said they were ‚Äúgathering information‚Äù themselves on the situation, but offered no details or update to Yahoo Sports this week. The team instead pointed to their previous statement.

What the Chiefs have found could have a significant impact on the case and the NFL itself. The accident occurred around 9 p.m. on the ramp leading from Stadium Drive to Interstate 435. That‚Äôs when Reid struck two vehicles, including one that carried Ariel. Her mother had driven to the spot to aid a cousin who had run out of gas.

It is the most direct route from the Chiefs' facility, where the coaching staff was working to prepare for the Super Bowl, toward Reid‚Äôs home in Overland Park, Kansas.

Due to NFL COVID-19 restrictions, Reid was prohibited from visiting any bars, restaurants or even a private residence. Doing so would have prevented not only him but anyone he contact-traced with from working the Super Bowl. Even then, there is no place to drink that would require taking Stadium Drive home.

As such, the suspicion is that Reid was drinking inside the Chiefs' facility, which like all NFL buildings has extensive video and professional surveillance and security.

Reid has a history of legal and substance abuse problems, including a prior DUI in Pennsylvania. The Chiefs overlooked that in the spirit of nepotism and gave Reid a job as their outside linebackers coach.

Reid was quickly suspended by the team following the crash. He did not travel to the Super Bowl, although since he was hospitalized that decision was moot. The team allowed his contract to expire a week after the season and he is not employed in the NFL. The Hunt family, which owns the Chiefs, has been in touch with the family of Ariel Young and is now offering support and resources.

Otherwise, it is still wait-and-see in Kansas City for a frustrated public.

There‚Äôs still hope for better days for Ariel, and for details and decisions from Kansas City law enforcement and the Chiefs themselves.

During an appearance Monday on FOX Sports 1‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Herd,‚Äù Sports Illustrated‚Äôs Albert Breer identified the franchise most likely to acquire the veteran quarterback from the Philadelphia Eagles.

So what‚Äôs the hold-up? Wentz seemingly has been available for trade for a few weeks now, and the Bears are in need of an upgrade under center.

Well, according to Breer, Wentz‚Äôs personal desires are serving as a hang-up in trade talks.

‚ÄúI think the issue right now, Colin, is where Carson Wentz wants to go,‚Äù Breer said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs become pretty clear he‚Äôd rather go to Indianapolis, and I think part of it now, for the Eagles, is, ‚ÄòAlright, if our best return now is Chicago over Indy, then we need to convince Carson Wentz, this is the only place you‚Äôre going, bud, and you need to buck up and accept this, and realize the Bears are going to give you a good chance.‚Äô

",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/why-tom-brady-patrick-mahomes-will-make-super-bowl-history-as-soon-as-they-take-their-first-snaps/,"Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes are used to making history. Brady, with a record six Super Bowl rings already in his possession, will go for a seventh when the Buccaneers face the Chiefs in Super Bowl LV on Feb. 7 on CBS. Brady's counterpart, Patrick Mahomes, made history last year by becoming the first player to win Super Bowl and league MVP honors before his 25th birthday. A win in Super Bowl LV would make Mahomes the youngest quarterback in history to win multiple Super Bowls.

As soon as they take their first snaps in Super Bowl LV, Brady and Mahomes will make even more NFL history. Brady and Mahomes will become the first winning quarterbacks from the previous two Super Bowls to face each other in the Super Bowl, as noted by NFL Network's Rich Eisen. Brady is two years removed from leading the Patriots to a 13-3 win over the Rams in Super Bowl LIII. Last February, Mahomes rallied the Chiefs to a come-from-behind win over the 49ers to claim Kansas City's first title in 50 years.

While the previous two Super Bowl winning quarterbacks have never faced each other in the Super Bowl, there have been six previous Super Bowls played between quarterbacks who had already won a Super Bowl. Here's a look at the quarterbacks who took part in those games.

Super Bowl Quarterbacks Result X Roger Staubach (DAL), Terry Bradshaw (PIT) Steelers 21, Cowboys 17 XIII Roger Staubach (DAL), Terry Bradshaw (PIT) Steelers 35, Cowboys 31 XVIII Jim Plunkett (LAR), Joe Theismann (WAS) Raiders 38, Washington 9 XLIII Ben Roethlisberger (PIT), Kurt Warner (ARI) Steelers 27, Cardinals 23 XLVI Tom Brady (NE), Eli Manning (NYG) Giants 21, Patriots 17 XLIX Tom Brady (NE), Russell Wilson (SEA) Patriots 28, Seahawks 24

In the previous six games between Super Bowl winning quarterbacks, a quarterback took home the MVP award on three occasions. In Super Bowl XIII, Bradshaw, the league's MVP that season, won his first of two consecutive Super Bowl MVP awards after throwing for 318 yards and four touchdowns in Pittsburgh's second Super Bowl win over Dallas. In the second half of Super Bowl XLVI, Eli Manning helped engineer three scoring drives to help the Giants win their second Super Bowl over the Patriots. In Super Bowl XLIX, Brady's two fourth quarter touchdown passes gave him his fourth Super Bowl ring and third Super Bowl MVP award.

Brady is 2-1 in the Super Bowl against quarterbacks that have already won a ring. His first Super Bowl win came at the expense of Kurt Warner, whose Rams fell to the Patriots in one of the greatest upsets in Super Bowl history. Sandwiched between that win and the Patriots' win over the Seahawks is New England's four-point loss to Eli Manning's Giants in Super Bowl XLVI. Four years earlier, Manning and the Giants had stunned Brady and the previously undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII, 17-14. Overall, Brady is 6-3 in the Super Bowl, and his six Super Bowl wins are two more than the second-winningest Super Bowl quarterbacks: Bradshaw and Joe Montana. His four Super Bowl MVP awards are one more than Montana, who went 4-0 in Super Bowls as the 49ers' quarterback.

The specter of facing the most experienced quarterback in Super Bowl history is not lost on Mahomes, who was asked about his soon-to-be Super Bowl counterpart following Kansas City's victory over Buffalo.

""Yeah I mean, the Super Bowl is the Super Bowl. Being able to go up against one of the greatest, if not the greatest quarterback of all time in his 150th Super Bowl,"" said Mahomes, who is 1-1 against Brady in his career. ""I mean it's going to be a great experience for me. To go out there and get to have a chance to repeat and get to do it against the best, I mean it's something special and I'm excited for the opportunity.""","Why Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes will make Super Bowl history as soon as they take their first snaps",2021-01-26 07:30:32

Over the course of his 21-year career, Brady has made the Super Bowl in every season where he's lost in Week 1 and that streak will continue this year if Tampa Bay can beat the Packers in Sunday's NFC Championship. In his career, Brady has been the starting quarterback in 19 openers and in those games, he's gone 15-4 as the starter. The first three Week 1 losses resulted in Super Bowl appearances and now, he'll be hoping the fourth Week 1 loss does the same.

Back in Week 1, the Buccaneers lost to New Orleans 34-23, but then they rebounded to go 11-4 over their final 15 games before winning two playoff games to get where they are now.

Here's a look at what happened in the other three seasons where Brady lost in Week 1.

2003

Week 1: 31-0 loss to Buffalo.

The opening week of the 2003 season was arguably one of the most disastrous games of Brady's career in New England. In a road game at Buffalo, Brady completed just 14 of 28 passes for 123 yards while also throwing FOUR interceptions in a 31-0 loss. The blowout loss must have served as a wake-up call because the Patriots would go 14-1 over the rest of the season.

End result: Won Super Bowl XXXVIII. Despite the loss in the opener, Brady and the Patriots still bounced back to make it to the Super Bowl, where they faced the Carolina Panthers. In a 32-29 win over the Panthers, Brady took home the Super Bowl MVP award thanks to a performance that included 354 passing yards and three touchdowns.

2014

Week 1: 33-20 loss to Miami.

During Brady's career, the Patriots always had a tough time playing in Miami and the opening week of the 2014 season was no different. Although the Patriots led 20-10 at halftime, the Dolphins dominated the second half by outscoring New England 23-0.

End result: Won Super Bowl XLIX. The 2014 season marked the first time in 11 years that the Patriots had lost in Week 1, but like they did in 2003, they rebounded with a Super Bowl win. Although Brady threw for 328 yards and four touchdowns, this game is mostly remembered for the fact that the Seahawks didn't give the ball to Marshawn Lynch at the one-yard line on their final offensive play of the game.

2017

Week 1: 42-27 loss to Kansas City.

This is the only opening-week loss of Brady's career that came at home and it was an embarrassing one. In the Thursday night opener, the Patriots got outscored 21-0 in the fourth quarter. Brady got outplayed by Alex Smith, who threw for 368 yards and four touchdowns.

End result: Made it to Super Bowl LII: Like every opening week loss of Brady's career, this season also ended with a Super Bowl appearance. The only difference this time around is that the Patriots didn't actually win the Super Bowl. Despite an NFL-playoff record 505 yards from Brady, the Patriots were still beaten by the Eagles 41-33.

In an era where nearly every team in the NFL loves to throw the ball, the Ravens and Titans have gone against the grain and their throwback strategy means we're going to be getting a postseason rarity: This week's game will mark the first time in nearly 32 years that the NFL's top-two rushing teams have faced each other in the playoffs.

The last time it happened came in January 1989 when the Bengals and 49ers met up in Super Bowl XXIII. In that game, the 49ers and their No. 2 rushing offense narrowly beat a Bengals team that ranked No. 1 overall in rushing in 1988. Although the Bengals had the NFL MVP on their team that year in Boomer Esiason, they still managed to average 169.4 yards per game on the ground. As for the 49ers, their ground attack averaged 157.6 yards per game even though they had Joe Montana under center.

Neither team came anywhere close to their season average as the 49ers totaled 111 rushing yards while the Bengals ended with 106 yards in San Francisco's 20-16 Super Bowl win.

The Ravens-Titans game will mark the just the fourth time that the top-two rushing teams have met in the postseason since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. Besides Super Bowl XXIII, there was also the 1972 AFC Championship that featured an undefeated Dolphins team (211.4 yards per game during the season) going up against the Steelers (180 yards per game). The other meeting came in the 1970 divisional round between the Cowboys (164.3) and Lions (151.9).

In the three previous meetings, the team that led the NFL in rushing yards has gone 2-1 with the Dolphins (21-17) and Cowboys (5-0) both winning. Also, that is not a typo, the Cowboys won a playoff game 5-0.

This year, Baltimore will be going into the postseason on the heels of winning the regular season rushing title. The Ravens averaged 191.9 yards per game on the ground this year, which led the NFL by more than 20 yards. The only team that even came close to matching them was the Titans, who finished second overall with an average of 168.1 yards per game (No other team in the NFL even averaged 150 yards). Not only did they rank one and two in rushing this year, they were also two of the three teams in the NFL that called more run plays than pass plays in 2020 (The Patriots were the other one).

Although they were the top-two teams in rushing yards, there was a stark difference in how they got there. The Titans are more a one-man show while the Ravens are more of a running back by committee. The Ravens had three players finish the year with more than 700 yards rushing, including Lamar Jackson, who ended the season with 1,005.

As for the Titans, Derrick Henry finished the season with 2,027 yards, which is the fifth-highest total in NFL history. Henry could continue to make history on Sunday: If he hits the 150-mark, he'll tie Terrell Davis for the most games in playoff history with at least 150 yards rushing.

The run game will be important to both teams, but it will probably be slightly more important to the Titans and that's because they went 2-3 this year in games where they got out-rushed by their opponent and 9-2 when they had more rushing yards. As for the Ravens, they went 3-2 when they got out-rushed and 8-3 when they had more yards on the ground than their opponent.

This game will mark the third time these two teams have faced each other over the past 12 months and not only did the Titans win both games, but they out-rushed the Ravens each time.",Ravens at Titans playoff game will feature something the NFL postseason hasn't seen in 32 years,2021-01-10 08:03:54

",https://bit.ly/38OMLeT,"The Mets and Blue Jays have long been considered the front-runners to land Astros free agent George Springer, and now, according to at least one report, they are the final two teams competing for the high-priced center fielder.

The New York Daily News' Deesha Thosar cited a source Wednesday that says Springer is expected to pick between those two finalists in January.

SAD TIMES: Josh Reddick has woo'ed his last 'Woo' with the Astros

SNY baseball reporter Andy Martino confirms that the Mets and Blue Jays are ""seriously interested"" in Springer, but that the Mets aren't as close to a deal as some have reported. Martino says the five-year, $125 million contract for Springer that has been floated is off and that Springer is asking for ""well over $150 million.""

MLB Network's Jon Heyman says the Mets and Blue Jays are engaged in a ""spirited derby"" for Springer as they bid against each other. He also says a deal could take a while as neither team has come close to Springer's asking price, but the Mets should be considered the favorite.

The Mets always have made the most sense as a Springer landing spot with new owner Steve Cohen looking to make a splash by opening up his wallet. Springer also grew up in New Britain, Conn., which is just about 100 miles from the Mets' Citi Field. Springer's wife Charlise grew up in upstate New York, also just about an hour-and-a-half drive from the Mets' home.

This is Springer's first chance to cash in on the free agent market. Before the 2020 season was shortened and salaries were prorated, Springer signed a one-year contract with the Astros worth $21 million. In November, Springer rejected the Astros' one-year, $18.9 million qualifying offer, which was a formality as the Astros had to offer that in order to receive draft compensation if he signs elsewhere.

If Springer signs with the Mets, it will be the second straight offseason an Astros free agent was lured from Houston by big money in New York. Last year, Astros pitcher Gerrit Cole signed with the Yankees for nine years and $324 million, the fourth-largest deal in baseball history.

The 31-year-old Springer will always be one of the faces of the Astros first championship. He was the 2017 World Series MVP, tying a record with five home runs in the seven game series. He homered in each of the final four games of that series against the Dodgers, setting a record for most consecutive games with a home run in the World Series.

Springer, who was the Astros' first-round pick in 2011, ranks fifth on the franchise's all-time home run list with 174 in seven seasons. His .491 career slugging percentage is sixth-best in Astros history.",Astros free agent George Springer reportedly down to two teams,2020-12-31 17:54:47

Against the Chargers on Thursday night, the Raiders quarterback was thrust into action in the first quarter after starter Derek Carr suffered a groin injury that sidelined him for the rest of the game. Because the injury happened with three full quarters to play, that opened the door for Mariota to not only see significant playing time but earn a serious raise in the process.

This offseason, Mariota inked a two-year, $17.6 million contract to join Las Vegas and back up Carr. As Field Yates of ESPN points out, there's an incentive to Maritoa's contact that if he plays more than 60% of the snaps in any game in 2020, he earns a crisp $200K. That payday could have reached $325K had the Raiders won, but Justin Herbert's goal-line plunge in overtime booted any chance of that extra $125K landing in Mariota's pocket.

Don't feel too bad for him though as his base salary for 2021 has now increased by $625K thanks to playing in more than 60% of their offensive snaps in this matchup as well. That means, Mariota made around $825K for his efforts against Los Angeles. Not too shabby for a Thursday night out in Vegas.

Despite being on the losing end, Mariota was extremely impressive and nearly had the Raiders pulling out the win. The former No. 2 overall pick completed over 60% of his throws for 226 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He also rushed for a game-high 88 yards and added another score with his legs. While a lot may be made about this quick cash-grab against Los Angeles following Carr's injury, this performance could even lead to a bigger payout if some quarterback-needy team this offseason sees Mariota as a potential starter for them in 2021.

MLB might‚Äôve tipped their hand at the Cleveland baseball team‚Äôs new team name, via the U.S. Patent and Trademark office.

A New York Times report late Sunday revealed that the ‚ÄúCleveland Indians‚Äù moniker would be no more. That was confirmed on Monday afternoon by team owner Paul Dolan, who said that the organization would part ways with the team name after 105 years following discussions with Native American groups. However, the change won‚Äôt take place until after the 2021 season at the earliest.

Some names that have been floated around are the Cleveland Spiders and the Rockers. However, the MLB might‚Äôve tipped their hand on the team‚Äôs newest nickname. That name is the ‚ÄúCleveland Citizens,‚Äù which appears to be registered by the league in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Citizens a potential name for the Cleveland baseball team

When looking at the name, the trademark was filed on Aug. 17, 2020. While the league appears to have filed the trademark, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it will ultimately be the new name. Rather, it would be more of a move to prevent someone else from filling out an application at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, so the league won‚Äôt have to negotiate a deal.

Momentum for Cleveland changing their name arrived after the Washington Football Team distanced themselves from their former insensitive moniker back in July. The Football Team name was initially used as a placeholder, but team president Jason Wright told ESPN that it was in the running to become the permanent name.

On Opening Day for the 2020 season, the Cleveland baseball team wore their navy blue road jerseys which had the city name on the front to support the name change.

Creating a new name for a sports team does take time, because they have to file trademarks for the name and the logo.

Earlier this morning, TSN Senior Hockey Reporter Frank Seravalli reported that the National Hockey League has shared draft schedules with the NHLPA on Thursday, including a 56-game season outline.

While Seravalli pointed out that the schedules were all based on a Jan. 1 start date, the two sides had discussed pushing that date back until later in the month.

And now his colleague insider Pierre LeBrun reveals that the plan is now to see the 2021 season get underway on Jan. 15, which could allow teams to get training camps going after the Christmas break.

A Jan. 15 start is now being discussed, source says, really no choice given that Jan 1 doesn‚Äôt seem realistic at this point. Economic issues still unresolved but both sides keep talking about other issues around season planning. As Frank says below, some positive vibes https://t.co/0uMf6FViG2 ‚Äî Pierre LeBrun (@PierreVLeBrun) December 4, 2020

Elliotte Friedman also confirms the report on Friday morning.

Latest details as far as I know https://t.co/fZgeON6uEi ‚Äî Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) December 4, 2020

For the past weeks, it sounded like the NHL was refusing to stray from its original goal of starting the season on Jan. 1, despite the fact that this projected date is just a month away and the format has yet to be determined. However, this new development sounds like a positive one despite the fact that the start date is getting pushed.

Now, we all know, many more details need to be ironed out. Players aren‚Äôt happy about too many things, especially that the NHL has reportedly asked for players to defer 20% of their salaries while escrow increases to 25%. And this despite the fact that both sides agreed to a new six-year collective bargaining agreement before the league‚Äôs return to play over the summer that accounted for the expected financial repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The union agreed to 10% salary deferrals with escrow capping at 20%. That money was agreed to be paid in three equal, interest-free instalments in October 2022, 2023, 2024.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman insisted Wednesday that the NHL is ‚Äúnot seeking to renegotiate‚Äù the six-year Collective Bargaining Agreement extension that was unanimously ratified by owners in July.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not actually having negotiations and we‚Äôre not seeking to renegotiate,‚Äù Bettman said. ‚ÄúWe made a number of assumptions collectively over the summer, most of which are not applicable anymore.



‚ÄúWhatever the revenues are, the players only get 50 per cent. And if we overpay them and they don‚Äôt pay us back in the short term, they have to pay us back over time. There will be stresses on the system, and we‚Äôve had discussions about what those stresses are, and how they might be dealt with. But we‚Äôre not trying to say ‚ÄòYou must do X, Y and Z.‚Äô We‚Äôre trying to look for ways to continue to work together.‚Äù

29,Matthew Stafford. The quote came from an unnamed coach. ,https://www.knbr.com/2020/11/30/would-win-super-bowl-coach-believes-49ers-should-trade-for-veteran-quarterback/,"

¬© Kirby Lee | 2020 Nov 29

For those hoping the 49ers move on from Jimmy Garoppolo this offseason, an intriguing possibility became more likely this week.

The Detroit Lions axed much maligned head coach Matt Patricia after another disappointing loss on Thanksgiving. With the Lions essentially bottoming out this season, a full rebuild is on the horizon, and now discussions are ongoing around the league regarding what the Lions should do with veteran quarterback Matt Stafford, who will be 33 before the 2021 season.

According to one NFL offensive coach, the 49ers should trade for him if he‚Äôs made available.

‚ÄúThey would win a Super Bowl,‚Äù an offensive coach said via Mike Sando of The Athletic. ‚ÄúStafford would be in a real organization finally. He would bend to Shanahan and that offense because there is such a history of success with that system. And Stafford would know he‚Äôs not going to get hit in the head all the time like in Detroit.‚Äù

Imagining Stafford as the 49ers‚Äô QB is all well and good, but acquiring him wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be all that easy. First off, Stafford has a cap hit of $34 million next season and nearly $28 million in 2022. That‚Äôs more than the $26.4 million and $27 million that Garoppolo is owed in the next two seasons, and would likely hinder the 49ers‚Äô ability to re-sign a few of their many upcoming free agents that includes Trent Williams and nearly the entire secondary.

It all depends on what the Lions want in return and how much the 49ers value a quarterback nearing the end of his prime. Stafford‚Äôs arm talent is fairly undeniable, and he‚Äôs still putting up numbers (261.5 yards per game, 18 touchdowns to 8 picks, 92.7 rating) on a very questionable Lions team.

Sure the 49ers as currently constructed with Stafford could be Super Bowl hopefuls, but would what they lose in bringing on Stafford keep them in that conversation?",‚ÄòThey would win a Super Bowl‚Äô: Coach believes 49ers should trade for veteran quarterback,2020-12-01 16:05:05

During the Buccaneers' 38-3 loss to the Saints, Tampa Bay somehow only managed five rushing attempts, which set the NFL record for fewest rushing attempts in a game.

To say Tampa Bay gave up on the run would definitely be an understatement, because it was worse than that. It was almost like the Bucs forgot the run existed. After calling two run plays in the first quarter, they would only call two for the rest of the game. The crazy thing is that Tampa Bay was on track to finish the game with just four rushing attempts, but it ended up reaching five because Blaine Gabbert's kneel down on the final play of the game counted as a rushing attempt.

Here's what the box score looked like for the Bucs at the end of the game:

Ronald Jones: Three carries for 9 yards.

Leonard Fournette: One carry for 0 yards.

Blaine Gabbert: One carry for -1 yard.

If you're scoring at home, that's five carries for 8 yards. Before Sunday, the NFL record for fewest carries in a game was six and that had actually been done four times. In a twist of fate, Tom Brady was also involved in one of those games.

It doesn't have quite the ring to it, but the Raptors likely don't care, they just want to play. The KFC Yum! Center is a capable host and according to reports, is the likely landing spot for next season.

We will have to wait and see what restrictions are still in place when the NBA season starts in 2021, but with Toronto continuing to be a hot spot for Covid and with the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team recently having to play all their home games in Buffalo, there's potential this sticks.

Next season for the Raps - gonna be finger licking good!

The Raptors will potentially play their home games in Louisville next season, per @VinceGoodwill

The Seahawks, Broncos and 49ers were fined an additional $250,000. The three fines added up to $1.05 million.

The fines came a week after Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive VP of football operations, sent a strongly worded memo to all 32 teams reminding them of the importance of wearing face covering during games. The memo also stated that future discipline could be enforced to coaches who don't comply with the league's rules. This season, any non-player in the ""bench area,"" which is defined as each sideline between the 30-yard lines, is required to wear a mask at all times.

""We must remain vigilant and disciplined in following the processes and protocols put in place by not only the league, union and clubs, but also by state and local governments,"" the memo read. ""Failure to adhere to this requirement will result in accountability measures being imposed against offending individuals and/or clubs ... Becoming careless or ignoring face covering and physical distancing requirements will put the 2020 season at risk.""

While he was not fined on Monday, Rams coach Sean McVay said that he did hear from the league following his team's Week 1 win over the Cowboys. McVay told reporters that he figured that the league's memo ""was directed at me.""

""I've got to do a better job about that,"" McVay said with regard to wearing a mask during games. ""So moving forward there will be a conscious effort to do that.""

Given the severity of Monday's fines, it's safe to say that coaches will put an added emphasis on wearing masks moving forward.","NFL hits Pete Carroll, Vic Fangio and Kyle Shanahan with big fines for not wearing masks on Sunday, per report",2020-09-21 19:22:21

Knox‚Äôs plea may have been a bit premature at the time. However, with star running back Saquon Barkley likely done for the season with a torn ACL, his vision may soon come to fruition.

NFL Network‚Äôs Ian Rapoport has reported that the Giants plan to bring in the ex-Atlanta Falcons starting running back Devonta Freeman for a workout. Freeman, who spent the weekend visiting an NFC East foe in the Philadelphia Eagles, ‚Äúshould be‚Äù visiting with Big Blue on Monday.

Freeman Still Offers Upside as a Dual-Threat Weapon

Freeman has endured a notable whirlwind offseason, which included rejecting a deal from the Seattle Seahawks earlier this spring. Since then, he reportedly threatened retirement and switched agents. He‚Äôs receiving a few bites but has left every visit without a contract, this after his new agent Drew Rosenhaus vowed to find Freeman employment by ‚Äúlate July.‚Äù

Despite the NFL‚Äôs reluctance to commit to Freeman, he‚Äôs still just 28-years-old and a viable enough talent to help an NFL roster. While he may no longer be the player who tied David Johnson for the lead-league in total touchdowns by a running back in 2015, Freeman‚Äôs multi-faceted skillset makes him a feasible placeholder for Barkley until 2021.

The former second-team All-Pro saw a downtick in his rushing prowess this past season, averaging just 3.6 yards per carry on the ground over his 14 games. With that said, he had averaged a far superior 4.53 ypc. over the five seasons prior. Not to mention, Freeman still remains one of the league‚Äôs better receiving backs, hauling in 59 receptions in 2019, ranked eighth-most amongst players at his position.

The Giants don‚Äôt have a clear answer to losing Barkley, who went down early in the second quarter of Sunday‚Äôs loss to the Chicago Bears. But then again, no team would. Offseason addition Dion Lewis tried his best to shoulder the load in Barkley‚Äôs absence in Week 2, yet mustered up a mere 20-rushing yards on 10 carries.

Wayne Gallman, the only other running back on the Giants‚Äô current roster, was a healthy scratch on Sunday. Expect Gallman to be tossed into action this coming week against a battered San Francisco 49ers team. Gallman has shown himself capable of producing as a go-to option in spot situations, most notably a 118-yard, two-touchdown performance back in Week 4 of last season.

Despite the duo of Lewis and Gallman, the Giants will be on the search for reinforcements in the backfield, a search which may just so happen to end with them adding a former two-time Pro Bowler into the fold.",Giants Eyeing Ex-NFL TD Leader as Saquon Barkley Replacement: Report,2020-09-21 18:38:04

Earlier this week, the Patriots inked giant Central Connecticut product, Jake Dolegala to a contract and added him to the team‚Äôs practice squad.

The Patriots have signed former Bengals QB Jake Dolegala to their practice squad. Quality move for the St. Francis High grad. ‚Äî Tim Graham (@ByTimGraham) September 15, 2020

Newton, who is 6-foot-5, is one of the bigger quarterbacks in the league, but Dolegala might make him look a bit little small.

Follow the Heavy on Patriots Facebook page for the latest breaking news, rumors, and content!

Where Is Dolegala From?

Dolegala played for four years at Central Connecticut. As a senior in 2018, he completed 61% of his passes, threw for 2,221 yards and 16 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions. He wasn‚Äôt drafted in 2019, but was a part of the Cincinnati Bengals‚Äô camp this year and in 2019 where he performed well.

During the 2019 preseason, Dolegala completed 37-of-61 passes for 347 yards and 2 touchdowns. There was some thought he could be a developmental prospect in Cincinnati, but once the team drafted Joe Burrow No. 1 overall in 2020, it was clear Dolegala was expendable, even as an option to supply depth.

The Patriots must have had an eye on him last year and in 2020 because they brought him in to be a part of the practice squad.

What Role Is He Going to Play on the Practice Squad?

For now, Dolegala is just on the practice squad to provide some depth. He is the only quarterback on the practice squad with the team having released Brian Lewerke. If for no other reason, Dolegala gives the Patriots a young player who can learn their system and continue to give wide receiver prospects like Devin Ross and Isaiah Zuber some work.

Could He Be a Developmental Quarterback?

With his height, strong arm and solid decision-making, Dolegala has some potential. However, he‚Äôd need to really show himself to be quite the quick study for him to make a big enough of a mark with the team to justify any level of security. To be honest, I‚Äôd be surprised if he was still a part of the team, in any capacity, by the end of the season.

Perhaps he‚Äôll be a surprise and push Jarrett Stidham as the best young quarterback on the roster.

They call it any given Sunday for a reason. Unlike other major sports, the NFL has the ability to have surprise teams get hot and make it to the top (See Tennessee Titans last season).

One could describe Bill Belichick in any number of ways.

He‚Äôs The Hoodie. The GOAT. A legend whose football acumen is renowned across the NFL.

But for some, a nickname given to Belichick early in his coaching career might perfectly encapsulate the New England Patriots‚Äô head man.

Here‚Äôs an excerpt from ‚ÄúThe Dynasty,‚Äù by Jeff Benedict, which The Athletic shared Wednesday in wake of the book‚Äôs publication:

One of Belichick‚Äôs nicknames was Doom. Bill Parcells had given it to him when Belichick was his defensive coordinator for the Giants. ‚ÄúWe used to call him Doom because every time he walked around it was the end of the world,‚Äù ex-Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor said. ‚Äú‚ÄòAh, you didn‚Äôt make this play.‚Äô ‚ÄòAh, you didn‚Äôt go over here.‚Äô It was the end of the world.‚Äù

The nickname fit Belichick‚Äôs dour demeanor, which fed into his tendency to focus on and prepare for scenarios that most coaches overlooked. ‚ÄúLooking at the negative side and preparing for the negative has made him a better football coach, because he prepares for all of the things that can go bad,‚Äù said Patriots defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel. ‚ÄúAnd to tell you the truth, I think he kind of halfway liked the idea that people were calling him Doom because that way, he didn‚Äôt have to be nice to anybody.‚Äù

According to The Athletic, Manning pulled in a total of $3.36 million, making him the only player on the NFLPA's royalty list who cracked the $3 million mark last year. At this point, Manning could probably just live off his royalties if he wanted to.

The royalty numbers come from the NFL Players Association and the earnings only take into account the sales of things that the NFLPA licenses, such as jerseys, video games, and trading cards. Manning likely made millions from his Nationwide commercials and Brady likely made millions doing endorsements for companies like Aston Martin and UGGs, but those aren't included in the total since those companies don't sell NFLPA licensed merchandise.
