The Israeli actress has appeared in some of the biggest movies of the last several years, including four entries in the Fast and the Furious franchise and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. She’ll also reprise the role of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman in the DC Extended Universe’s Justice League, which is due out later this year. But if Gadot’s face is nigh inescapable, she’s not yet a household name—and even people who do know her name usually say it wrong.

Perhaps it’s the similarity to the absent title figure of Samuel Beckett’s most famous play, but the go-to pronunciation for Gadot’s surname tends to treat it as if it’s French: Guh-DOH. But as mentioned above, Gadot is not French: She’s Israeli, and she pronounces her name, quiet sensibly, in the Israeli fashion, which is to say with a hard T and a short O: Guh-DOTT. Here’s Jimmy Kimmel, making a good effort but not quite getting it right.

But why subject yourself to the imprecision of phonetic spellings when you can learn from the woman herself? Here’s Gal Gadot saying “Gal Gadot,” followed by a long string of people following her lead.

One last tip. The correct pronunciation of “I am upset that a movie that is opening on well over 2,000 screens will have a tiny number of individual showings whose audience is voluntarily limited to women” is “Boo-HOO.”",2017-06-04 14:41:29

Season 7 of Game of Thrones is teased in new trailer

The four-legged star behind Jon Snow's faithful companion passed away this week at the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary

Game Of Thrones author George R.R. Martin has made the sad announcement today that the real-life wolf who played Ghost is dead.

Jon Snow's faithful companion was played by an albino Arctic Wolf and lived at the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary in Nex Mexico, USA.

The four-legged star of HBO's fantasy drama, who passed away this week, was part of a pack that lived at the rescue centre supported by the Martin family.

Breaking the news on Twitter, Martin said: ""In loving memory of the real life Ghost from the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary. He passed this week & he will be missed. R.I.P""

Fans of the show took to Twitter to give their sympathies and hope that the direwolf won't be killed off in the books or the show.

Ghost is one of the only two remaining Stark direwolves in Game Of Thrones, but Nymeria has been missing since the first season.

The runt of the litter, who was gifted to illegitimate Stark Jon Snow, quickly became popular amongst fans during his time at the Wall.

Ghost was clearly distinguishable from the other family pets due to his albino fur and striking red eyes.

Game Of Thrones fans have had to deal with the tragic deaths of four direwolves on the show, but hope Ghost could possibly sit at his master's side by the Iron Throne.

In season 1, Northern Inuit Dogs played the young puppies, with Sophie Turner adopting the dog who played Lady.

Game Of Thrones viewer took to Twitter to give their sympathies for the real-life ghost.

One fan said: ""Aww thats so sad RIP beautiful creature!""

Another added: ""Losing a friend is never easy. May he be not only missed but also remembered.""

A third said: ""A great man once said...'The lone wolf dies but the pack survives""

Meanwhile, fans of the show have found out that they won't have to wait too long for its return.

The release date for season 7 has finally been announced in a brand new teaser

Fans of the hit HBO series have been forced to wait over a year for their next fix of Westeros, but the wait will soon be over.

The next series will premiere on July 16th, where viewers will see the battle for the Seven Kingdoms get into full swing as Daenerys Targaryen sails across from Essos to face Queen Cersei.

However, the teaser shows the danger about to come down from the north, as the camera pans slowly moves out from the evil blue eye of the Night King to reveal his dark face.

The official Game Of Thrones twitter account tweeted: "" #GoTS7 begins 7.16 on @HBO . #GameofThrones

While the battle for the Iron Throne wages on in the south, the threat everyone should really be focusing on is the White Walkers.

Fans couldn't contain their excitement over the new teaser, but were slightly disappointed that another full trailer has not been released

Just three weeks after the first trailer dropped, new snaps were released showing Queen Cersei sitting regally on the Iron Throne with her brother-slash-lover Jaime Lannister standing beside her with his impressive sword on display.

Cersei - who spent the last season behind stripped naked and humiliated as punishment for her infidelity - wears a simple metal crown and chain mail armour, suggesting she'll be doing battle to cement her status as royalty in the upcoming series.

Other pictures show Lyanna Mormont, who up until Season 6 was a little-known character until she proclaimed her house for Jon Stark, declaring him the King of the North.

The upcoming series also catches up with Gilly and Samwell Tarly, who can be seen studying some books in a dark room. Gilly is reading, suggesting Samwell has achieved his goal of educating her since they fled from her abusive husband.

Daenerys Targaryen is back, looking serious as she surveys a scene in front of her. She wears a dragon badge on her outfit, but there are no signs of her three dragon 'offspring'.

Tyrion - by now Daenerys' Hand, or chief advisor - is in place beside her, alongside Varys 'the Spider', Grey Worm and Missandei.

As last month's trailer showed, the battle to rule the seven kingdoms has been absolutely ruthless so far, and that's not about to change.",2017-05-24 16:34:33
2,"""...I always thought I was the most outsider, weird person in the movie, and, 'Why was I cast in it?' and I had no voice."" ",http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1653270/why-diane-keaton-hasnt-watched-the-godfather-in-30-years,"While Diane Keaton might not be the first name that comes to mind when you think about The Godfather, her performance as Michael Corleone's long suffering wife Kaye Adams is still a fine and memorable turn in the classic movie. It turns out that Diane Keaton herself has actually been disregarding her work in The Godfather, too. The legendary actress has now admitted that, until recently, she hadn't watched The Godfather in around 30 years because she always saw herself as the outsider in the film. Diane Keaton admitted,

I was so shocked because I never did pay that much attention to The Godfather because I always thought I was the most outsider, weird person in the movie, and, 'Why was I cast in it?' and I had no voice. But then I had a couple of good scenes with Al.

Of course, Diane Keaton isn't wrong with her assumption, because Kay Adams-Corleone is one of the few non-Italian characters in both The Godfather and The Godfather Part II. In fact, Kay Adams is constantly kept at arms length regarding the family business throughout the films, and as things escalate throughout the second movie, the audience even sees her become a prisoner in her own home. Still, The Godfather is a movie that's on cable fairly often, and you'd have at least expected Diane Keaton to have a quick peek at her performance at some point over the last thirty years, especially since she's in the iconic final shot of the first film.

Diane Keaton admitted at the Tribeca Film Festival that she finally sat herself down to re-watch The Godfather for the first time in three decades recently. As you'd expect the actress was blown away by just how engrossing and gripping the gangster epic was, especially because she still found herself overwhelmed by the film even though she was watching it on a computer. Diane Keaton recalled,

I saw it on my computer. I hadn't seen it for I think about 30 years. And I looked at 1, and I just remember all the people, I couldn't handle it, it was so astonishing, it was so beautiful, and everybody is so great in it, and the music, and every choice [Francis Ford Coppola] made. And that damn Talia -- I saw you in that scene with all the fighting. And then you had slow, long scenes. Everything was astonishing to me. And I was totally surprised because I didn't expect it. And on a fucking computer.

Diane Keaton made the above revelations during the emotional reunion of The Godfather's cast and crew at the closing night of The Tribeca Film Festival on Saturday night, which came after the first two films were screened back to back over an absorbing 7 and a half hour period. As well as Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and co-writer and director Francis Ford Coppola took part in the wide-ranging discussion, which was hosted by director Taylor Hackford and was supposed to last 45 minutes but actually went on for an hour and twenty. I will forever be thanking my lucky stars that I was in attendance at the once in a life-time event, and stay glued to CinemaBlend over the next few days for further stories and revelations from the panel.

In addition, Paramount will release all three films in the epic Godfather crime saga on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD on Tuesday, May 9.",2017-05-13 11:00:00

Disney is slowly collecting a nice slew of voice talent for their upcoming live-action Lion King. First, there was Donald Glover playing Simba, along with James Earl Jones returning as the voice the wise Mufasa. The studio is pretty keen on snagging Queen B to play Queen of the Jungle, Nala. And now, they’ve announced who’s taking on the roles of jungle best-friends forever and ever:

Timone and Pumbaa will be played by – drumroll, please — Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner.

9,The Walking Dead has become more about gore than storytelling. ,http://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/fans-leaving-show-season-walking-dead/,"HAS THE WALKING DEAD KILLED THEIR FANS?

According to The Verge, and several Twitter fans of The Walking Dead, many die-hards are leaving the show this season after the opening episode of Season 7 where we lost Glenn and Abraham. They’re also leaving in troves as the ratings have dropped to an all time low since Season 3.

Rest assured: these numbers DO predict the future of the shows that run on TV. With the recent backlash of gore, Walking Dead even had to cut back the blood in Fat Joey’s death.

They are listening to the fans, but some have gone completely rogue and are boycotting the show at every turn.

The main reason people are leaving isn’t just because two leads were killed, where only one was expected to die. If that were the case, there wouldn’t be anyone left to watch Game of Thrones, where leads die off in packs.

The reason people are leaving is that they feel the creators are more about the shock value of the show than the story. Essentially, the series has gotten to a point where it’s more into manipulating its audience than being faithful.

Obviously, this is somewhat of a double-edged sword. While it can’t be denied, why would fans want everything exactly like the comic series? Have we not developed a degree of trust in a show so powerful? Is it possible that these thoughts are just from fair-weather fans?

Blaming Showrunner Scott Gimple

Some fans blame new showrunner, Scott Gimble, saying he took an emotionally charged show that involved zombie deaths and character growth and turned it into torture porn, rather than a network drama.

The evidence for this idea started in Season 6 when we went down the rabbit hole as the gang was trying to escape. Again, this can be argued both ways. Were we manipulated or were we given a chance to feel scared for our heroes?

Other points of manipulation include Glenn’s dumpster death (which even involved removing his name from the credits). They leaked bashed-in-head photos online. And yes, they filmed everyone to avoid actual leaks, but this seems no different than Christopher Nolan keeping his work private. They kept Negan’s identity secret. But again, this is somewhat of a stretch and is more about storytelling. Consider the opening of The Departed where we don’t see Nicholson’s face, but merely a silhouette for the first few scenes to add drama.

Will Negan Make Rick Stronger?

Whatever your opinion, this all lead up to the premiere where Glenn and Abraham were killed by the hands of Negan in a horrific manner involving Lucille, Negan’s trustworthy baseball bat.

Later, when Negan was attempting to force Rick to cut off his son’s arm, some refer to this as cruel and violent, as well as cheap tension. Again, this feels like something necessary to change Carl and Rick’s relationship within the story. To a degree, whatever Negan does will make Rick stronger.

While it would appear to be best to defend the series, those who are leaving seem to have their minds set. They feel that the show has left its roots of character development, which could tie in with the fact that we already know King Ezekiel’s background, something that may have been kept secret longer before.

Whatever these quitters feel about this new fork in the road, one can’t help but think of a favorite team’s losing season after a big win. Fewer jerseys line the store windows, and ticket prices are lower, but maybe it’s because the fans just haven’t screamed loud enough.

We’ll find out soon enough.

",http://en.newsner.com/crowd-asks-springsteen-to-play-another-singer-s-song-his-response-leaves-them-speechless/about/music,"These days, performers usually prepare every detail of their concerts ahead of time. Especially when they are world-class artists like Bruce Springsteen.

But if you’re accomplished as much as Springsteen has, you can pretty much do whatever you want.

So when Bruce saw a sign in the audience during a concert in Leipzig, Germany asking him to play “You Can Never Tell” from the cult movie “Pulp Fiction,” he handled it, well, like a boss.

Bruce started by trying a couple of different keys and consulting with his band. In front of a crowd of 45,000, “The Boss” was straining. Not even the band could hide their surprise, and I can’t even imagine how the promoters and organizers were feeling.

Then a few seconds later, Bruce and the band gave it a shot—and I need hardly mention that the performance was a smashing success.

11,"The lyric ""Only shootin' stars break the mold"" was originally ""Wave bye bye to your soul"" ",http://www.spin.com/2017/02/original-handwritten-lyrics-show-smash-mouths-all-star-was-almost-a-much-darker-song/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=timeline,"Smash Mouth’s “All Star” is a motivational speech wrapped in a pop song. “Hey now! You’re a rock star, get the show on, get paid,” and so on. There doesn’t seem to be much ambiguity in its message: being an all star is cool, being a rock star is cool, getting paid is definitely cool, and hey, you never know–if you give yourself a shot and aim for the skies, you might break the mold and become an all star, too. Cool!

But according to an original draft of the lyrics, penned by original Smash Mouth guitarist Greg Camp and tweeted out from the band’s account this afternoon, there might be a darker side to living out your dreams of riches and celebrity.

At the end of the chorus, there’s a line crossed out, with the lyric that made the final cut–“And only shooting stars [will] break the mold”–shoved into the margin. Look closely, and you can read the original draft underneath the scribbles: “Wave bye bye to your soul.”

That single line puts a darkly ironic twist on a song that otherwise seems pretty naive: sure, you can live only for fun, hit the ground running, take the backstreets, and set your world on fire–you’ll shine, you’ll glow, but you might lose the very thing that makes you human in the process. Being a rock star is fun and all, but sooner or later, you end up alone on the tour bus, surrounded by empty bottles, staring into a tiny handheld mirror, wondering where your high school sweetheart is and what things would have been like if you’d taken a different path. (Or maybe I’m just projecting.)

Look at the top of the lyrics sheet (which the band has tweeted out at least once before), and you’ll also notice a subtle perspective shift in the first verse. “All Star” originally opened not with an unnamed somebody looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an “L” on her forehead, but with the song’s narrator, Mr. All Star himself, as the dumb one. What does it all mean?

With the “bye bye to your soul” thing in mind, all sorts of other hidden depths of “All Star” start to reveal themselves. There’s that glancing reference to climate change in the second verse, for one thing. And isn’t the assertion in the chorus that all that glitters is in fact gold just a little to peppy and on-the-nose to be taken at face value? The darkness and mystery implied in “All Star” inspired one incredibly devoted Smash Mouth fan to compile a Reddit post two years ago, explaining in detail why “Smash Mouth’s song “All Star” is about the exact opposite everyone thinks it is.”

We may never know the band’s reason for cutting the “soul” line and replacing it with much more saccharine lyrics about shooting stars. But if “All Star” really is about the ultimate hollowness of contemporary life, I guess there’s a lot more going on in the opening sequence of Shrek than we gave it credit for, too.",2017-04-28 17:29:00
12,Joss Whedon has to be willing to work on the series. ,http://epicstream.com/news/Fox-is-Open-to-Rebooting-Firefly-But-Only-Under-This-Condition,"Fox already brought more episodes of X-Files and Prison Break before, but some fans are wondering if there's a chance that they would reboot Firefly. Creator Joss Whedon's sci-fi western was canceled after its first season, but the story was continued in a film titled Serenity. Fans of the show, a.k.a. Browncoats, have been wishing for the franchise's revival since well...it's cancellation. And while many believe that it's too late for a second season, Fox Broadcasting President of Entertainment, David Madden is open to more Firefly if Whedon is.

While at the panel at last month's TCA 2017, Madden told Rotten Tomatoes that he's open for a Firefly reboot (via TV Overmind). but Madden only wants it if Whedon is involved. It would be awesome to see fresher episodes of this beloved sci-fi western franchise, and I'm sure its former cast members would be open to reunite in a new show, but the Avengers: Age of Ultron director is currently busy making films.

After Age of Ultron was released in theaters, Whedon told Collider: ""there are rights [issues] between Fox and Universal because one had the show and one had the movie, so it gets a little funky fresh with that.""

13,Achieved 100% ScreenTest score. ,http://hellogiggles.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-perfect-score/,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" just did something no other Marvel movie has done before

Just when you thought you couldn’t get more excited for the next installment of Marvel’s Guardians franchise, there’s more good news. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 got a perfect score in a test screening — which is, so far, the highest score a Marvel movie has ever snagged. That’s just downright the highest score any film can snag.

Now hold up, what’s a test screening? Test screenings are early screenings shown to audiences to get an idea of how the film will perform. Even Iron Man 3 and Avengers only got scores in the 90s out of 100. But Vol. 2 walked away will a 100. You know Baby Groot is excited.

The film won’t hit theaters until May 5th but after the success of the first Guardians of the Galaxy and the continued success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films in general, it feels like the pressure is mounting on each film to be better than the ones before. So a high audience testing score is certainly a reason to celebrate! Although, according to Deadline, Marvel uses mostly friends and family for their test screenings in order to prevent leaks. Of course, that could result in higher scores than random people.

Director James Gunn has been posting lots of fun behind-the-scenes photos on his Instagram account which has only increased anticipation for the film. It looks epic.

Audiences are certainly excited about the film as well tweeting their excitement every time a new image, teaser, or tidbit of information is released.

15,"Basically, HBO handed back the rights because they didn't understand the script. ",https://www.avclub.com/article/it-took-more-ian-mcshane-and-prayer-get-american-g-254290,"The All-Father uses emoji. “This is the first time I’m saying this in an interview,” American Gods co-showrunner Michael Green divulges when talking with The A.V. Club last week. “Ian McShane: He makes fun of Instagram, Twitter. ‘Oh, that social thing I leave that to you’—he will text with emojis and GIFs. It means we’re in a world where we all have a much more complicated relationship with technology.”

Advertisement

That’s surprising news from an actor who joked with The A.V. Club about turning his back on modern technology, and even more notable considering the character he plays in Green’s series represents the world before gadgets and smiley-face icons. American Gods casts McShane as Mr. Wednesday, a.k.a. All-Father, a.k.a. the Norse deity Odin. He’s the leader of a group of old gods now moored in the U.S. and prepping for war against the new ones, whose ranks include physical manifestations of present-day obsessions like, yes, technology. The old gods are representative of the legends people brought with them when they came to America; the new ones are what we’ve become consumed by. When the novel by Neil Gaiman came out in 2001, emoji weren’t part of the cultural dialogue. Now the already acclaimed adaptation is set to debut in a much different landscape, one in which an eggplant can be used to convey something dirty and stories about immigration are inherently political. But when or how it was going to be adapted wasn’t always a given.

American Gods isn’t an easily contained or explained narrative. It’s a sprawling, complicated epic that centers on Shadow (Ricky Whittle), who, just out of prison, is hired (or, perhaps more accurately, is coerced) into working for Wednesday after discovering that Shadow’s wife, Laura (Emily Browning), has died in a car crash while having an affair with his best friend, Robbie (Dane Cook). Along the way the new gods like Media (Gillian Anderson) try to woo Shadow to join their side or threaten him. And all the while Gaiman weaves historical tales of how these deities wound up in the country. Remove the fantasy elements, and the show’s about how this nation was built on the many faiths of countless people who traveled from far away to get here.

For Gaiman, the process of getting American Gods to the screen wasn’t a particularly lengthy one. (The author reserves that designation for the constantly in-flux movie based on his comic The Sandman.) Throughout the years, he fielded offers from filmmakers intrigued by the text but baffled by how to translate it. “I write a book, it’s obviously unfilmable,” he says. “I do not worry about the fact that it’s unfilmable. Because I’m writing an unfilmable book, I have a great time with that. So people phone me up and say, ‘Hello, I am a famous director that you have heard of. I just read your book. I think it would make an amazing movie, but how would you make this into a movie?’ And I say, ‘I don’t know.’ I say, ‘Honestly, I think at the point where you make it a 120-page script, you’ve thrown away anything that makes it interesting,’ and so nothing ever happened.”

In 2011, however, he joined forces with Tom Hanks’ production company, Playtone, to develop an American Gods series for HBO. News that the project was underway broke just before HBO launched a different fantasy property: Game Of Thrones. “By the time we’d handed our script in, our nice, smart exec had gone, and the people remaining were going, ‘We don’t really know what it is, and we don’t really understand it, and we don’t like it that much,’” Gaiman said. “So we did two drafts and a polish, and they gave us the rights back.” The author explains he was “relieved” when HBO got out of the picture, which ultimately led him to Starz and Bryan Fuller, the creator of visually marvelous worlds ranging from the whimsical (Pushing Daisies) to the nightmarish (Hannibal). What sold Gaiman on Fuller was not that he had a vision for tackling the challenging material immediately in mind, but that he loved the book. Fuller remembers Gaiman coming to visit him in Toronto; when he was asked if he wanted to do it, he said yes—with Michael Green, creator of the biblical-themed and short-lived NBC series Kings, which starred McShane. These days, Green is racking up blockbuster credits like the acclaimed Wolverine movie Logan, the Blade Runner sequel, and the new Murder On The Orient Express.

The producers and cast acknowledge that they did not have any easy task ahead of them. Actor Pablo Schreiber—who plays the tall, nasty leprechaun Mad Sweeney—says he was initially perplexed by how it was all going to come together. “I was just blown away by the world,” he recalls. “I was like, ‘What is this magical piece of writing?’ And so crazy, like how is this a TV show? How does it work? Then, after getting the job, I went back and read the book, and it started to make a little more sense, although I still couldn’t really imagine how it was going to be a TV show.”

Even before he took on the part of old god Mr. Nancy, Gaiman’s version of the folkloric arachnid Anansi, Orlando Jones had affection for what Gaiman had put on the page. “The core principle obviously is you can manifest your thoughts into realities if you believe,” he says. “An interesting and powerful concept but a difficult visual to realize.”

Green and Fuller came to the concept as fans, but that doesn’t mean they were 100 percent faithful. “We wanted to recreate our experience, and by definition that’s going to be our experience as a reader, which is going to be different from yours or anyone else’s,” Green said. “But we could also reassess our own experience reading it. Especially in those first three episodes where we were adapting parts of the book that are very great, tight story and offer a very strong point of view. We also knew we wanted to sow the seeds for the later orchard of other points of view and other tonal diversions.”

Whittle didn’t finish reading American Gods until filming for season one was complete, because Green and Fuller stopped him, eager to create a unique version of Shadow. “They straight-up said, ‘Stop reading the book because it’s affecting your performance, and that’s not the character we want for TV,’” he says. “You don’t want a man who thinks every week. Shadow was very blasé and quiet in the book, and that’s just not going to work for the adaption. We needed him to kind of fight, and more friction with Mr. Wednesday.”

But perhaps the most notable change to the story involves fleshing out Laura’s backstory and her own plot. (Per Schreiber, Laura and Mad Sweeney eventually get their own road trip. It was pitched to him as: “Bonnie And Clyde with a zombie and leprechaun.”) The fourth hour establishes her complicated persona, and Fuller considers it “perfect hybridization” of his and Green’s styles. For Green, it’s indicative of how their ideas can mesh seamlessly with the source material. “It’s fan fiction that works its way into the new author’s preferred text,” he says.

Indeed, to Gaiman the series is a collaborative effort between himself and the pair, who will call and email him with questions. He points out details from the original that he knows will be important to the sequel that he’s writing, and puts his foot down when he believes they have misconstrued a character’s intentions. (However, he found his biggest demand—that the diversity of the characters and the cast be kept intact—was a non-issue for both the showrunners and Starz.)

And the show may yet have some impact on what Gaiman produces in the future. “Were I ever to write Wednesday again, he would probably sound a lot more in my head like Ian McShane, because listening to Ian deliver those lines is like, ‘Oh, that is the best they could ever be delivered,’” he says. But will he share McShane’s penchant for emoji?",2017-04-28 02:41:42

Miranda, who Dwayne Johnson introduced as his “twin,” rapped an original prologue before Cravalho, 16, took over singing duties. Dancers — clad in blue attire — brought the film to life on stage, creating an oceanic look with scarves. Despite her vocal prowess, the performance had a hiccup as one of the ribbon twirlers hit Cravalho on the head with her prop. The newcomer — already a pro — barely flinched.

Auili'i Cravalho got hit in the head by a flag and kept going like a champ #Oscars pic.twitter.com/onS3dvCBfY — Variety (@Variety) February 27, 2017

Miranda, the mastermind behind “Hamilton” is competing for best original song — up against other Broadway composers, including Benj Pasek and John Paul, who wrote lyrics to Justin Hurwitz’s music for two of this year’s nominated songs, “City of Stars” and “Audition (The Fools Who Dream)” from “La La Land.” It’s also up against “The Empty Chair” from “Jim: The James Foley Story” and “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” from “Trolls.”

If Miranda takes home the best song award for “How Far I’ll Go,” he’ll earn the elusive EGOT — Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards — and join the even more select group of people who have also won a Pulitzer Prize.

“How Far I’ll Go,” is considered the “I Want” song, a tune typically sung by the main character in Disney animated musicals that describes their dissatisfaction with their current life, and their hopes for a new life in the near future. It’s akin to “Part of Your World” from “The Little Mermaid” and “Just Around the Riverbend” from “Pocahontas.” But “How Far I’ll Go” stretches those boundaries, as Moana sings in longing for personal growth, as a 16-year-old girl who wants to venture out and become better for her own world.",2017-04-27 12:13:00

While some companies resort to timing their promotional tweets to be sent out atcertain times throughout the work day, others take a more holistic approach, interacting with their customers as tweets roll in. Some companies are so sassy about it that their hilarious brand tweets make national news!

You might remember the humorous musings of the Wendy’s Twitter account a few months back, but it looks like mobile giant Samsung is looking to get in on the action.

While promoting their newly released Samsung Galaxy S8, the mobile powerhouse asked its users to submit their very first photos taken with their new phones.

Internet troll savEdward gave them a response that was a bit too personal for most people’s taste.

But rather than blowing off the troll’s NSFW response, Samsung instead decided to go for the jugular and hit the man right where it hurts using a single emoji.

And because the savage response could be seen by millions, it wasn’t long before other Twitter users joined the party.

Samsung’s response had many iPhone users preparing to switch over to that Android life.

Now that’s how you craft a masterful burn.

21,Pizza. It's literally right in the picture. ,http://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a52288/pizza-wedding-cake/,"When Jess Melara and Tony Sanchez were planning their wedding, which took place last December in Miami, they decided to skip the traditional white wedding cake and serve pizza instead.

""Tony and I love pizza and aren't huge fans of cake, so we surprised our guests with Pizza Cake (yes, I said pizza cake!),"" Melara told Wedding Chicks. ""It was saucy and delicious and what pizza dreams are made of.""

Here is their four-tier wedding ""cake"" in all of its cheesy glory:

If you're worried that they missed out on any wedding traditions like picking out a cute cake topper, cutting the first slice or feeding each other a bite, you'll see here from these photos captured by Todd Good Photography that it's possible to do all those fun things with a piece of pizza instead.

We also love how their caterer made the pies more wedding-worthy by adding edible flowers and basil leaves to the tiers. But our favorite detail? These fun boxes they used to serve slices to their guests.

Before any cake-lovers out their totally lose it over the fact that this couple served pizza instead of cake at their wedding (gasp!), you'll be happy to hear that their guests with sweet tooths weren't totally left out. They also hired a food truck to serve nine different flavors of gelato at their reception, and also handed out Cracker Jacks and funfetti cake as favors for everyone to take home.

Best. Wedding. Ever.

22,"The previous actor, Richard Harris, was homophobic. ",http://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/viral-sir-ian-mckellen-reveals-the-reason-he-turned-down-playing-dumbledore-20170404,"Sadly, we'll never have a quintessential answer to Who'd win in a fight between Gandalf and Dumbledore?""

Firstly, they're both from different worlds, meaning they'd never cross paths. Secondly, Dumbledore is dead and Gandalf sailed away to the Undying Lands. And thirdly, this is all completely fictional.

However, let's get it straight here: If we're talking Gandalf the Grey vs Dumbledore, we're probably looking at Dumbledore just coming out on top. However, if we're talking about Gandalf the White vs Dumbledore, old Albus would be down on his knees begging for mercy within seconds. He just wouldn't stand a chance.

Advert 10

As it turns out, the two wizards could have been the same person.

Following Richard Harris' death in 2002, the role for Dumbledore needed to be filled. By this point Sir Ian McKellen had already cemented himself as Gandalf the Grey in The Fellowship of the Ring, and was awaiting the character's return at the end of the year in The Two Towers.

You'd think that already playing one wizard in a mega film series would be enough of a reason to let Michael Gambon take the role in Harry Potter's world, but there was another, fairly emotional reason.

Speaking on the BBC's HARDtalk the 77-year-old revealed that he was called by the producers of Harry Potter and asked if he'd like a part in the film.

Advert 10

Sadly, he turned it down due to the fact that the deceased Harris, who brought the role to life, allegedly expressed homophobic views.

""When he died - he played Dumbledore, the wizard - I played the real wizard of course - but when they called me up and said would I be interested in being in the Harry Potter films, they didn't say what part,"" openly gay McKellen said on the show. ""I worked out what they were thinking and I couldn't. I couldn't take over the part from an actor who I'd known hadn't approved of me.""

Advert 10

McKellen came out a gay to the general public back in 1988 on a BBC Radio show, and has since been an activist for LGBT rights.

In a statement on his website, he said: ""I have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about - nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.""



The actor is the co-founder of Stonewall, a LGBT rights group, named after the Stonewall riots.

Earlier this year, McKellen and millions of other demonstrators took to the streets for the Women's March in both the USA and the UK.

He was pretty much the star of the show, rocking up to the London march with this amazing sign:

The Women's March in London was the longest I have been on. See the rest of my message attached. pic.twitter.com/q7QC4Jvg0S

- Ian McKellen (@IanMcKellen) January 22, 2017

The sign, which has his best pal Sir Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in his famous face-palm meme pose. Perfect.

Advert 10

Taking to his own Twitter, Sir Ian posted a photo of himself with the Picard placard and this message:

""The Women's March in London was the longest I have been on. Unlike most demonstrations it was not commandeered by any one group with its identical posters.

""The women and their allies had devised their own visual protests, hand-written and improvised at home, expressing their personal reaction to the new President, whose name in schoolyard English means 'to break wind' appropriately.

""The placard of Sir Patrick, by the way, was not my own - I found it at then end of the March in Trafalgar Square. But there were hundreds of others, including the other three here.

""President Breaking Wind has impacted us all; and personally. Some like him, think they can identify with him, believe him because they've seen him on television perhaps and think the billionaire and his billionaire team are truly their friends. The rest of us, including the majority of voters in the USA, see through the charade: after all, the schtick is not exactly subtle. But he's riled us, got under our skin, asking us angry and despairing that he should have got through to the final of his show and turned democracy into a TV/Twitter spectacular.

""What will happen? No doubt his believers will soon be disillusioned. The rest of us cannot let him reign unchallenged. The Marches today were a good beginning. Some who fear him say 'give the man a chance', OK - he's started by removing LGBTQ people, climate change and state funding of the arts from POTUS's website. He's had his chance.""",2017-04-26 11:50:00

",http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/25/marvel-studios-phase-4-untitled-film/,"If there is one thing that Marvel Cinematic Universe does well, it is planning. The huge franchise is well into its third phase right now, and Marvel Studios has features slated to release through 2019. In a few weeks, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will make is debut, and other release dates line the MCU up through May 2019. However, Marvel Studios has been holding onto three premiere dates for untitled projects for some time. And, today, news broke that one of them had been delayed.

Over on Twitter, Exhibitor Relations pushed for the rumormill to begin after one untitled Marvel film had its release date pushed from July 10, 2020 to August 7, 2020. The one-month delay is a not a long one, but it does let fans know Marvel Studios will be aiming for the film to have a late-summer, early-fall premiere.

For now, it is hard to tell which film could take the spot's place. There is always a chance that Marvel Studios may seek out an original series to debut in August 2020. After all, that date follows after Avengers 4, and Kevin Feige has stressed that the MCU will go in a very different direction after the ensemble flick.

Of course, there is also a definite chance that the release date is being set aside for a sequel. 2019 will see Captain Marvel, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, and Avengers 4 hit theaters. It may be that Marvel Studios wants to bring out Doctor Strange 2 or even Guardians of the Galaxy 3 at this time. The former franchise had its first film premiere last fall, so a August 2020 sequel release would give the film fours years to get done. That timeframe seems a bit long for Marvel Studios, so others have speculated the date will be reserved for the next Guardians of the Galaxy film.

The man standing behind that podium with $0 to his name on Jeopardy is named Kevin. The question that he was pondering so seriously was one we’ll let you try and answer now.

What is the name for this?

Perhaps we are the violent sort. Maybe the fact that we immediately knew the answer to this could be blamed on our love of violent movies and television shows and video games.

The correct answer, in case you haven’t figured it out, is hitman.

But that’s not the answer that Kevin gave to the question.

",http://www.techtimes.com/articles/192443/20170118/carpool-karaoke-did-james-corden-dare-to-reveal-the-worst-singer-ever-video.htm#pt0-712142,"In a recent raucous version of ""Spill Your Guts Or Fill Your Guts"" on CBS' The Late Late Show with James Corden, the talk show host proved that he wasn't afraid to name names when it comes to calling out bad behavior by celebrities. But how did Corden react when game partner Khloe Kardashian dared him to name the worst ""Carpool Karaoke"" guest ever?

The Late Late Show with James Corden Clips And Games

By now, almost everybody knows about the wildly popular ""Carpool Karaoke"" segments on James Corden's late night chat program The Late Late Show. The famous sing along car rides are among the most viewed videos on YouTube, with well over 1 billion views and counting for the 23 segments filmed thus far.

Last year's most viewed viral video of all was Corden's ride with singer Adele, and the show is soon set to become a separate series spinoff on Apple TV, with Corden still on board as a producer, but not as host.

While the ""Carpool Karaoke"" clips may be the most popular from Corden's show, there are a bunch of other regular rotating games and bits on The Late Late Show, one of which is the aptly titled ""Spill Your Guts Or Fill Your Guts."" In the segments, Corden competes against a celebrity guest, as one alternately dares the other to either answer a revealing question or eat a disgusting food.

Corden's Truth Or Dare

This time it was Kardashian sister Khloe in the hot seat. When challenged by Corden, Khloe admitted that her least favorite show on the E! network was Rob And Chyna, starring none other than her brother, but then chose to eat a fish eye rather than tell whether or not she believed ""OJ did it.""

When Khloe asked Corden who was the ""rudest celebrity"", Corden almost balked as he worried that the show might be trying to book the star for an appearance. However, when Kardashian pointed out that if the person was rude, Corden shouldn't even want him on the Late Late Show, Corden admitted it was Pierce Brosnan, who had pushed him at a concert.

Then it came time for the big reveal of another celebrity name when Khloe asked the million-dollar question: Who was the worst singer ever on ""Carpool Karaoke?"" Corden looked pained as he paused and considered whether he'd want to answer, ultimately deciding that it would be ""unfair"" to do so and instead electing to chow down on a chicken foot.

It was clear however, that Corden did have a name in mind, and our money is on Britney Spears, who herself characterized her appearance on ""Carpool Karaoke"" as ""awkward"" in a later interview, in which she called Corden ""the guy,"" confirming Corden's producing partner Ben Winston's suspicions that the ditzy dance diva hadn't even seen ""Carpool Karaoke"" before actually filming it.

27,Leonard never wears lenses in his glasses. ,https://www.yahoo.com/news/something-big-bang-theory-never-220622002.html,"There’s something in “The Big Bang Theory” we never noticed this ENTIRE time

This is going to blow your mind, because the one mad obvious thing you’ve never noticed on The Big Bang Theory has been right in front of our faces this whole time…or should we say in front of Leonard’s face. We take for granted that the characters on The Big Bang Theory are our fellow nerds, ’cause they mostly are, but we’re here to expose Dr. Leonard Hofstadter for the FRAUD that he is. As any person who truly wears glasses knows, it’s a burden to bear, even if they’re SUPER CUTE and in line with your #aesthetic, keeping glasses clean is a lifelong chore.

But not for Leonard — because his glasses aren’t real and don’t have lenses, ya’ll. Yeah, as glasses wearers, we feel betrayed, too.

Look deeeep into his eyes — and you’ll realize that it’s actually quite easy to do because his glasses have no lenses and you can see straight through.

Galecki told the Huffington Post, “We rehearsed the first episode for about a week and a half, and when we started to shoot, they said, ‘Well, you’re gonna take your glasses off, right?’ I said, ‘No, I want Leonard to wear glasses.’ They said, ‘Oh, we just thought you were wearing them as Johnny for rehearsal all week.”

He also said that they had to get rid of the lenses in his glasses for shooting purposes — when he looked up with his regular glasses, the lights caught the lenses and created a glare. WE GET IT, IT’S PRACTICAL.

“I quickly popped out the lenses and that’s the movie magic behind that,” Galecki stated.

And obviously Galecki has run into problems on set. It must be weird to wear glasses with no lenses and act like nothing is wrong. In fact, the actor told HuffPo that he’s accidentally poked through the frame and ended up scratching his eye (which, ouch). “That kind of killed the moment,” said Galecki. We bet!

Story continues

But we can’t help but feel a liiiiitle betrayed by one of our favorite nerds. We still love you, Leonard, but we’d love you better with real glasses. JUST sayin’.

29,"""I wouldn’t touch those, are you kidding me?” Kennedy said with a laugh. “Those will always remain his."" ",http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/04/24/star-wars-george-lucas-altered-versions-lucasfilm-kathleen-kennedy/,"When George Lucas sold his company and the Star Wars Universe to the Walt Disney Company, fans were rightly worried about how this major change would affect the stories they've loved and cherished for decades.

And despite the Extended Universe stories being swept under a different bubble, no one has much to worry about regarding any other major alterations to the original films, much like what Lucas himself did to the cuts over time.

Speaking with the Steele Wars podcast at Star Wars Celebration last week, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy spoke about the company's commitment to George Lucas' final cuts and that they would not alter the films in any way.

""I wouldn't touch those, are you kidding me?"" Kennedy said with a laugh. ""Those will always remain his.""

This could be taken one of two ways, considering that fans have been clamoring for the unaltered versions of the movies for quite some time. Does this possibly mean that Lucasfilm would be against releasing the original cuts of the film, and that the continuously-modified Special Editions will remain the only versions available?

UP NEXT: Episode IX To Undergo Its First Script Reading Soon

Disney's purchase inspired some hope in fans who have wanted a high definition release of the original cuts—without the CG dance scenes, the extra wompa shots, and the infamous altering of ""Han Shot First""—but there is a wrinkle in that plan due to the original deal with Fox and Lucasfilm.

Fox owns the distribution rights to Star Wars: A New Hope in perpetuity, and their distribution deal for the other episodic films will lapse around 2020 and revert to Disney. So anything done before them is in conjunction with Fox, and Disney probably isn't keen on splitting such a huge money pie with a competitor.

But Kennedy's words also indicate that George Lucas' vision is the only vision, even if it's at different times, and they'd be silly to ignore the demand for a rerelease of the original cuts.

Maybe we just shouldn't expect to see that until 2020 at the earliest.

A storm is coming for the ladies of Litchfield when Orange Is the New Black returns.

Netflix announced Wednesday a date for the highly anticipated return of Jenji Kohan’s prison dramedy. The fifth season of OITNB will premiere June 9.

Along with the release date, the streaming giant unveiled a 15-second teaser for the new season, providing a first glimpse at the collective mood of the orange-clad prisoners after season four’s game-changing tragedy and cliff-hanger finale.

The footage rotates from prisoner to prisoner as Alex (Laura Prepon), Piper (Taylor Schilling), Nicky (Natasha Lyonne), Flaca (Jackie Cruz), Taystee (Danielle Brooks), Lorna (Yael Stone), Cindy (Adrienne C. Moore), Maria (Jessica Pimentel), Red (Kate Mulgrew) and Gloria (Selenis Leyva) are shown running a post-Poussey Washington gamut of emotions, ranging from shock to fear and rage. The teaser ends where season four left off, with Daya (Dascha Polanco) holding the gun that will seemingly initiate a prison-wide riot.

Laverne Cox, though missing from the teaser, also joins the returning castmembers for season five.

After the provocative death of fan-favorite character Poussey (Samira Wiley) — who was accidentally suffocated by Bayley (Alan Aisenberg), a white guard, during a protest — her body was left on the floor for a day and her death was covered up, prompting a grieving Taystee to incite the inmates to riot. Enraged by the abuse at the hands of the new guards, Daya gets a hold of one of the guard’s guns and points it back at him, leaving viewers to wonder if she will pull the trigger and where the timely Netflix dramedy will ricochet come season five.

“It’s war,” Brooks told The Hollywood Reporter when asked about the effect Poussey’s tragic death will have on the upcoming season. “Taystee has nothing to lose, she’s lost everything that she cared so deeply about. It’s time to fight”

Brooks recently revealed the fifth season of 13 episodes will take place over the course of three days, breaking tradition from previous seasons. OITNB has kept the time span of each season vague so as to not specifically address how much time is left on characters’ sentences, and the condensed time span is likely a shift to address the intense fallout after the inmates’ devastating loss.

“It will be very detailed, very intense, and you better get ready,” Brooks added of the season. “Get your popcorn, your tissues.”

The cast of the award-winning series, produced by Lionsgate, recently picked up their third consecutive SAG Award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a comedy series. Ahead of the season-four premiere, OITNB was renewed through season seven, marking the longest commitment of any Netflix original series.",2017-04-24 11:34:00

Apple's digital assistant will surprise you with references to The Lego Batman Movie if you pretend she is the Batcomputer.

The gimmick works if you say ""Hey 'Puter"" or ""Hey Computer"" (gravely Will Arnett voice not required). When you do, Siri will respond with a handful of Batman-appropriate responses like, ""How can I help you, Lego Batman"" and ""Welcome home, sir. FYI, Robin is trying on costumes in the Batcave again. He's doing some pirouettes in Batryshnikov.""

Here's a look at some of the responses we got when we tried it out:

(Note that Siri only works hands-free when you say, ""hey, Siri,"" so you'll have to hold down the home button or tap the microphone after you've activated Siri.)

This isn't the first time Siri has gotten a timely pop culture-inspired update. Apple's assistant is a known fan of Game of Thrones, Back to the Future, Pokémon Go, and a whole bunch of other robot-themed sci-fi movies.

While the Lego Batman update may not be Siri's most memorable pop culture update (or even her best troll) it should be a fun surprise to fans of the movies.

And whatever you do, just don't ask Siri to be your Valentine.

34,It prevents their feet from swelling and forming blisters. ,https://brightside.me/wonder-curiosities/this-is-why-celebrities-wear-shoes-that-are-too-big-for-them-307860/,"Many of you have probably paid attention to the fact that some celebrities appear on the red carpet wearing shoes that are at least a size too big. Why? Is this a new fashion trend? Or is there more to it? We at Bright Side have decided to figure this out.

In fact, many Hollywood stars deliberately choose to grace the red carpet wearing heels that are too long or too wide for them. They just know a simple secret: by doing so, they will prevent their feet from swelling and forming blisters. After all, celebrities have to wear high heels for hours — sometimes all night. Obviously, their feet will swell.

To avoid foot pain, discomfort, and chronic foot issues later in life, celebrities choose to wear shoes that are at least a size too big for them. Moreover, large pumps or sandals won't rub, pinch, or squeeze because they don't put pressure on the most vulnerable areas of the feet.

To keep shoes that are too large from slipping off the feet at the worst possible moment, stylists just put silicone pads inside the pumps. This simple trick ensures that the shoe fits snugly but stays on the foot, does not restrict blood circulation, and stops feet from swelling.",2017-04-23 14:20:00
35,Photos can be uploaded quickly and used to track her. ,http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-03-01/this-is-the-reason-emma-watson-doesnt-take-photos-with-fans,"The 26-year-old actress has been explaining that she only occasionally agrees to pose for snaps because ""it's the difference between being able to have a life and not.""

As the star of Harry Potter and Beauty and the Beast, Emma Watson probably gets asked for more than your average share of celebrity selfies. But she rarely says yes...

“If someone takes a photograph of me and posts it, within two seconds they’ve created a marker of exactly where I am within 10 metres,” Watson explained to Entertainment Weekly. “They can see what I’m wearing and who I’m with. I just can’t give that tracking data.”

But she doesn't let fans walk away empty handed, instead offering to sign autographs or have conversations: ""I’ll say, ‘I will sit here and answer every single Harry Potter fandom question you have but I just can’t do a picture.'”

Watson credits the rise of social media for making it particularly difficult for her to lead a life away from the spotlight. ""People will say to me, ‘Have you spoken to Jodie Foster or Natalie Portman? They would have great advice for you on how to grow up in the limelight.'

“I’m not saying it was in any way easy on them, but with social media, it’s a whole new world. They’ve both said technology has changed the game.”

36,If he was put in a film with Deadpool. ,http://comicbook.com/2017/03/03/patrick-stewart-professor-xavier-deadpool-return/,"This weekend, the world will bid goodbye to two iconic members of the X-Men Cinematic Universe. Both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are bowing out of the series after more than a decade on-board. The stars will exit their respective roles as Wolverine and Professor Xavier when Logan hits theaters, and fans are mourning the end of an era. While Jackman had been open about his decision to leave, Stewart's admission had plenty stunned as the actor only confirmed the suspicion last month. However, there is one way the actor could return to his longstanding role.

It's simple; Just put him in a film with Deadpool.

Recently, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman took part in a fan-based interview with MTV. It was there the British actor was asked if he was done with Professor Xavier for good. Here's what Stewart had to say:

""I would have said yes, but the discussion just now about Deadpool makes me think, well, maybe there is a proper justification for the revival of Charles Xavier.""

This isn't the first time Stewart has pitched in support for Ryan Reynold's mouthy mercenary. Last month, the actor said he would love for Professor Xavier to meet Deadpool. ""I would love that. Just set it up,"" Stewart said, even going so far as to ask Jackman to pull enough strings to ensure the meet-up happened.

Hopefully, Professor Xavier won't try too hard to read Deadpool's mind. He may have to scrub his own clean after doing so.

Not long ago, Jackman also confessed he would be interested in playing Wolverine a bit longer under one condition. The actor said he would continue in the role if the grumpy mutant were somehow folded into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, given 20th Century Fox's frosty relationship with Marvel Studios, it does not look like the crossover is likely.

""In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces.""

Logan stars Hugh Jackman (Logan), Boyd Holbrook (Donald Pierce), Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier), Dafne Keen (Laura Kinney/X-23), Doris Morgado (Maria), Stephen Merchant (Caliban), Elizabeth Rodriguez (Gabriela), and Richard E. Grant (Dr. Zander Rice). James Mangold is directing and helped on the screenplay along with Scott Frank and Michael Green.

37,English Muffins from The Model Bakery. ,http://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Oprah-s-greatest-extravagance-is-from-Napa-and-11078894.php,"When someone with the wealth and popularity of Oprah Winfrey talks about her ""greatest extravagance,"" plenty of things come to mind.

A predilection for seriously expensive vacations, maybe? A love for flipping multi-million dollar homes, à la Ellen DeGeneres, perhaps?

While the talk show host certainly doesn't shy away from luxury trips and pricey real estate, instead Winfrey's greatest extravagance is... apparently available for purchase in St. Helena.

That extravagance? English muffins from The Model Bakery.

""My greatest extravagance is flying in English muffins from Napa Valley,"" Winfrey said in an interview with People Magazine. ""There's a specific English muffin made by these two women at this wonderful bakery in Napa Valley. I know it's not a good carbon footprint to fly in your English muffins but...""

RELATED: Oprah admits she was 'off balance' two years after ending talk show

Winfrey named the English muffins as part of her holiday ""Favorite Things"" list in 2016. In her description of the muffins, Winfrey wrote: ""I don't have to tell you all how much I love bread. These English muffins are my current carb of choice: crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and scrumptious all over—especially when slathered with the amazing Clif Family preserves that are included. Full disclosure: I took a few bags home from the shoot!""

Model Bakery owner Sarah Mitchell confirmed Winfrey's love for the English muffins, telling the Napa Valley Register last year that she had tried it while in wine country.

""Oprah had the chance to taste our English muffins while visiting the Napa Valley earlier this year, and really loved them,"" Mitchell said. ""We've been sending her special orders for a while and were thrilled when we learned that they would be featured as one of her favorite things for 2016.""

While it may seem strange to declare a baked good an ""extravagance,"" consider the fact that a dozen English muffins and a jar of preserves will set you back $40 on the bakery's online store. The muffins are made of a focaccia dough, all hand-shaped by the bakers, then cooked in skillets using clarified butter. In 2013, Model was noted as making about 1,000 English muffins a day, although we wouldn't be surprised if that number has since increased, due to the Oprah Effect.",2017-04-22 12:03:00
38,Vin Diesel. ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1647049/who-came-up-with-the-idea-of-family-in-the-fast-and-furious-movies-according-to-michelle-rodriguez,"While the idea of family in the Fast and Furious franchise has become something of a running joke in online forums, the fact of the matter is that it is impressive to see how this series has never shied away from that central theme. The last seven films have stayed loyal to that core message, and The Fate of the Furious (which debuts in theaters tomorrow) will seemingly double down on it as the franchise moves forward. So who came up with it? Who was the person who figured out that family would make these films pop? According to franchise star Michelle Rodriguez, it can all be traced back to Dominic Toretto himself -- Vin Diesel. Rodriguez said:

It's something that came out of Vin's mouth when he didn't like the line that was there, and I love how it caught wildfire. At the end of the day the movie is all about that. If you've got no heart to keep together all the blowing up and explosions, nobody really cares

So according to Michelle Rodriguez's recent interview with The Los Angeles Times, we can thank Vin Diesel for the heavy emphasis on family that has carried the Fast and Furious franchise through its good and bad times. Throughout all of the monumental changes that have taken place over the course of this series' existence, and above everything else that has transpired over the course of the last sixteen years, one little ad-lib by Diesel established the idea that anchored the Fast and Furious franchise. From 2001's The Fast and the Furious to Paul Walker's final moments on-screen at the end of Furious 7, that's what it has all been about.

We cannot even begin to stress the importance of family when it comes to the success of this film series. Plenty of other big budget blockbusters have attempted the same level of chaos and carnage accomplished by the Fast and Furious movies, and in all honesty, some franchises have outperformed this series in that regard. However, by keeping the series centered on a simple and (most importantly) universal theme like family, the Fast and Furious films have managed to cast an enormous audience net and maintain a sense of intimacy even when things get chaotic and insane during the car chases.

If you are a newcomer to the world of Fast and Furious movies, then you may not ultimately realize how often that topic gets brought up in conversation during these films. For a lesson in the finer points of family, check out a supercut of Fast and Furious ""family"" moments below to see for yourself:

Knight was with Tupac when he was killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996. Despite the incident happening over 20 years ago the mystery that surrounds his death, as well as a number of bizarre conspiracy theories, has kept people interested in the case.

However, Knight - who is standing trial for a different murder - has opened up about what he saw that evening. He claims that it was in fact he who was the intended target and that his ex-wife and the former Death Row Records security chief are behind the ordering of the shooting.

Thaddeus Culpepper, Knight's attorney, wrote in an affidavit that his client had known for 'many years that Reggie Wright Jr and his ex-wife, Sharitha, were behind the murder of Tupac and attempted murder of Knight'.

41,He killed all the main characters. ,http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/03/19/rogue-one-writer-cant-believe-what-disney-let-him-get-away-with/,"As the first spinoff film in the Star Wars Universe, Rogue One was expected to take some risks. But the film's writer couldn't believe just what Lucasfilm let the production get away with.

Speaking with our ComicBook.com's Patrick Cavanaugh, writer of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story's Gary Whitta said he always thought the cast of characters in the film would have to die by the movie's end.

""I never believed that they would let us kill off all the characters in the film,"" Whitta said. ""That was our original instinct. The very first meeting with Gareth I remember saying, 'I kind of feel like they all need to die, but there's no way Lucas ... There's no way Disney'll let us do that. We can't kill everybody. It's a Disney movie.' And yet, they were fully supportive of it, and it's actually one of the coolest things about the film.""

Rogue One chronicles the journey of a ragtag group of Rebels who band together in an effort of recovering the Death Star's plans, in which there's one crucial flaw to be exploited planted within by the superweapon's creator.

The crew ultimately sacrifices their own lives so that the plans can get into the hands of Princess Leia and her cohorts, leading directly into the first Star Wars film released 40 years ago.

UP NEXT: Why Fans Will Never See Its Opening Crawl

""It's one of the thing that I hear the most is that last 20 minutes when you've got all these characters are basically going to make the ultimate sacrifice,"" Whitta said. ""It's the biggest kind of emotional punch that I think the movie has. I'm so glad that they supported that decision.""

Whitta elaborated that there was an enormous pressure from day one—not from Lucasfilm or Disney, but from himself. He said that he and Gareth Evans were determined not to be responsible for being the ones who ""screwed up Star Wars.""

""It took us awhile to get to grips with what it really meant to do a standalone film, but then once we understood it, we realized that it's actually really liberating,"" Whitta said. ""These characters are kind of one and done characters. There was never going to be a Rogue Two. Rogue Two already exists. That's what the original Star Wars is, and those characters aren't in it apart from Leia and Vader, and so we knew that we, now didn't necessarily mean that we had to, but it meant we had the luxury to, you know, we had the full spectrum of options in terms of what the fate of these characters were.""

He added that their deaths wasn't in the first draft of the story because they didn't think Lucasfilm or Disney would allow it, possibly leaving main character Jyn Erso on the table to appear in a future film.

""We always felt that it was the right thing to do, that these characters make the ultimate sacrifice,"" Whitta said. ""It wasn't that way in my original script, but again, we never felt that we would get away with it. K-2 always died, but Jyn survived in the very first version of the movie that we developed, and then it was Gareth who kept pushing for it, saying, 'I feel like they need to die. They need to die.' Eventually he convinced [Disney and Lucasfilm].""

Ultimately, the film benefitted from having a sense of finality in the greater, ongoing Star Wars saga.

""We kind of went back to that original idea of these characters, you know, it was kind of okay that they died, because they completed the mission,"" Whitta said. ""They die so that the whole Star Wars franchise can live, basically.""

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story hits digital HD on March 24. The film will then be released on Blu-ray and DVD April 4.

",http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/18/marvel-unveils-first-look-at-brie-larson-as-captain-marvel/,"Marvel Studios invited select members of the press to tour their offices on the Disney lots in Burbank, California on Monday afternoon.

During the tour, several new looks at films and characters coming up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were unveiled, including Taika Waititi's portrayal of Korg in Thor: Ragnarok, but none were more exciting than the first female hero who will get her own film.

On display in one of Marvel Studios' offices was a trio of concept art photos showcasing Larson in costume as Captain Marvel.

The costume was pulled straight from the pages of Marvel Comics. The most notable difference is the downplaying of the yellow which grabs the eye of those looking at Carol Danver's constume. Instead, it is a much lighter yellow, which can appear to be white at a glance. Otherwise, the suit on the cover of Kelly Sue Deconnick's Captain Marvel #1 is a quite accurate representation of what fans can expect to see in live action.

Artist Andy Park did point out that the costume is still evolving and Larson has not yet tried on the design featured in the concept art images.

Beneath the pair of images which simply showed Larson in costume as Captain Marvel was a design of the character fighting a handful of mech-type enemies in city streets. The enemies had purple eyes, one pair of which were shooting lasers in the background, but Captain Marvel used only one hand to keep the immediate threat's attempted punch away from her -- and was making it look easy.

As for whether or not those images will be released online any time soon, it doesn't sound like it. Larson will make her debut as Captain Marvel in Avengers: Infinity War which is deep into production but Marvel Studios is looking to keep the focus on the four remaining films prior to the ensemble: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor: Ragnarok, and Black Panther.

Top Chef's Shirley Chung and Brooke Williamson Reveal What They Eat When They're at Home

The life of a Top Chef alum seems like it's a nonstop food-fest all day, every day—cooking and tasting the best of the best, traveling the world, and getting wined and dined everywhere you go. We can imagine all that excess takes its toll. So when Top Chef Season 14 winner Brooke Williamson eats at home, she tries to stay healthy.

""I don't eat a lot of dairy, I don't eat a lot of processed food,"" the Los Angeles-based chef said, explaining that she travels a lot—and when she travels, she indulges herself. ""So when I go home, I feel like that's my time to kind of collect myself and clean out,"" she explained.

In fact Brooke, who owns four restaurants in LA along with a store selling culinary goods, recently completed the trendy Whole30 diet and gave up drinking alcohol for a month. ""And I felt great! So I kind of wanted to continue it,"" she said, adding with an eye-roll: ""And then I came to New York.""

Top Chef Season 14 first runner-up Shirley Chung also likes to stay healthy when she's not traveling or working. ""I cook a lot of Italian and Chinese food at home, so it's always balanced with lots of vegetables, a little bit of protein, and some starch. Naturally, I don't eat a lot of dairy…and I love vegetables,"" she said.

Shirley is hard at work on her new restaurant, a casual spot called Steamers Co., which she plans to open in downtown LA. She's partnered up with her husband (who will be working the front of the house) to serve up simple, healthy bowls of steamed seafood.

Keeping it healthy at home, however, isn't always easy. Shirley said she tries to avoid carbs, but ""I cannot stay away from rice, noodles, or soy sauce,"" she declared. ""So there's no way I could do [Brooke's] Whole30.""

The Whole30 program bans ingredients like sugar, grains, dairy, and legumes—including all forms of soy. Meat, seafood, veggies, some fruit, and good fats are allowed.

The latest hand-me-down that the youngest Jenner sister has gotten her hands on is a killer pair of over-the-knee boots that originated in Khloe's extremely organized closet. Kylie shared the leopard-print stilettos on Instagram, captioning it, ""to have older sisters who love to share is a blessing,"" so we're guessing Khloe already knew this particular pair of statement shoes had gone missing. See? At least she's asking first.

Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Yes, Khloe (and to the rest of the family, for that matter...), we would love to also be invited to share any goodies you no longer feel like you need to keep around for yourself. And with your amazing new fashion line, we can see exactly why Kylie chose to raid your closet.

Bella Thorne Ditches Her Red Hair For Something Much More Dramatic

Bella Thorne is trying something different from her trademark fiery red hair. On Wednesday (December 28), she shared a video of herself with her tresses dyed a deep navy ombré — a pitch-black color that bleeds into midnight blue.

The Disney Channel alum revealed her new 'do on Snapchat, where she snapped every step of the dyeing process. This included her jamming out to Lil Aaron and Futuristic while waiting for the dye to set. She shares so much of her life with fans that it's no surprise she documented the whole experience on social media.

Before this, Thorne rocked neon red and yellow hair with her older sister, Dani. Then they both dyed the tips of their hair rainbow two weeks ago. Now Bella's gone blue (da ba dee da ba die).

Does this mean Dani will follow her baby sister's footsteps? She hasn't posted any blue hair pics yet, but judging from this Instagram tease, the answer might be yes.

Dancing With the Stars Close this dialog window Streaming Options

Latin Night of Dancing with the Stars featured several 10s, a wet Argentine Tango, and a spicy performance by Pitbull, Flo Rida and Lunch Money Lewi$ (who sported a waffle brooch). But not everyone left the ballroom Monday wanting to Salsa into the night.

After a blah blah Cha Cha, Amber Rose became the latest celebrity to leave the ABC show. Her ouster came after a particularly damaging rehearsal package, when she’s seen walking out on her partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy after she couldn’t learn the steps.

“It was such an amazing experience and people don’t know this about me, but I’m really shy in a lot of ways,” Rose told host Tom Bergeron after she was ousted. “I think that showed on the ballroom floor. I tried my best.”

It was obvious during the rehearsal package that the competition was weighing heavy on Rose, who walked out on Chmerkovskiy after he lost his cool and punched the mirror when she wasn’t following his direction.

“You just did everything super perfect, you are not going home. You are going from the beginning to the end,” he protested as she began to cry. “If you’re done, then we are not going to be ready. Amber, I’m not going to let you go. You have to do it for you, you have to do it for me.”

She bugged out, anyway.

The duo clearly rallied on Monday, but their Cha Cha — performed to “Bla Bla Bla Cha Cha Cha” by Petty Booka — only earned 28 out of a possible 40. So long, gal!

The night’s biggest highlight was a very moist Argentine Tango performed by Jana Kramer and Gleb Savchenko. Dancing to Selena Gomez’ “Hands to Myself,” the duo borrowed a page from Flashdance and performed half of the dance while soaked.

“Now that is chemistry!” exclaimed judge Julianne Hough. “You set the record for the hottest Argentine Tango.”

“Pulsating with lust!” added judge Bruno Tonioli. “Driven by unsatiable desire!”",2016-10-19 01:35:00

And Carl Lentz.

As the lead pastor at Hillsong Church in Manhattan, Lentz has become known as the “rockstar pastor,” counseling celebrities on matters of faith when he’s not leading his come-as-you-are congregation. Lentz began talking to Bieber after an introduction from a West Coast pastor, Judah Smith, and that’s when Lentz learned of Bieber’s interest in baptism.

“The choices he had made ― he got to a place where he was like, ‘I want to start fresh.’” Lentz says.

Lentz speaks with Oprah about Bieber’s baptism on this weekend’s “SuperSoul Sunday,” where he details the story from beginning to end. When Bieber and Lentz first discussed baptism, Lentz says he explained its intention as “an outward sign of what God’s doing inward.” This resonated strongly with the singer, who Lentz says was ready to commit himself to Jesus in a way that he hadn’t done before.

“He has had a relationship with Jesus, and his mom did a great job doing her best to plant the right seeds. But you can get to a point as a man where it goes from being your mama’s relationship ... to yours,” Lentz says.

However, with the paparazzi constantly following Bieber’s every move, finding the peace and privacy for a baptism was an ongoing challenge.

“We went to four different places,” Lentz says. “I finally called my buddy Tyson Chandler.”

Chandler, a professional basketball player living in New York at the time, received the phone call from Lentz around 3 a.m. “I’m like, ‘Yeah, I need to borrow your [rooftop] pool,’” Lentz says. “He’s like, ‘I can’t get into the pool, but come and use my bathtub.’”

Since he is over 7 feet tall, Chandler’s tub was specially made to accommodate a man of his stature and would be large enough to baptize Bieber, who stands at 5’9”. Despite it being the wee hours of the morning, Lentz describes the whole scene as relatively normal. “Kim Chandler, Tyson’s wife, had some food out,” Lentz says. “This is like regular stuff for our type of church.”

The baptism itself, he adds, was anything but “regular.”

“It was probably one of the most special things I’ve been a part of,” Lentz says.

In one of the biggest revelations from the books, J.K. Rowling writes that Lupin's werewolf condition is a metaphor for illnesses that carry a stigma.

In a section of Short Stories From Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies, J.K. Rowling details the life of Remus Lupin, from childhood until his untimely death at the hands of Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. Lupin — who Rowling calls ""one of her favourite characters in the entire Potter series"" — was, of course, a werewolf. And according to the author, his lycanthropy is a metaphor for illnesses that exist in the Muggle world.

""Lupin's condition of lycanthropy was a metaphor for those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS,"" Rowling writes. ""All kinds of superstitions seem to surround blood-borne conditions, probably due to taboos surrounding blood itself. The wizarding community is as prone to hysteria and prejudice as the Muggle one, and the character of Lupin gave me a chance to examine those attitudes.""

Remus Lupin alienated himself from the world because of his condition. He became a werewolf on his fifth birthday, as detailed in the short story about his life found in Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies, as well as on Pottermore. Remus's father, Lyall Lupin, encountered a werewolf, Fenrir Greyback, during his time working for the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. He knew Greyback to be a werewolf upon sight, but the other members of the Ministry did not believe him. They teased Lyall, who grew angry and described werewolves as ""soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death."" Greyback heard these comments, and when the Ministry released him from custody, he plotted his revenge again Lyall Lupin. The werewolf journeyed to the Lupin's house, opened Remus' window and attacked the boy. Because the Greyback bit him in his wolfish form during the full moon, Remus was infected.

Lyall greatly regretted what he had said about werewolves. His son was the same as always — he wasn't evil or soulless, but clever and kind and smart. Still, Lyall decided to keep his son's condition a secret. The family moved constantly, upending their lives each time someone caught wind of the situation. ""Remus was not allowed to play with other children, in case he let slip the truth of his condition,"" Rowling writes. ""In consequence, and in spite of his loving parents, he was a very lonely boy.""

His loneliness persisted, until one day a wizard named Albus Dumbledore arrived on his parents' doorstep and invited him to attend Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, he made true friends — James Potter and Sirius Black — who learned his secret and loved him unconditionally. After their death, he returned to his solitary ways, but he eventually found a home with his family, Tonks and Teddy.

In a separate section of the book, Rowling details the difficulties of living with lycanthropy. She doesn't discount the challenges of his condition, but she emphasizes that he lived an amazing life despite the difficulties— he had a wife, a son, wonderful friends, and a mission. We know, of course, how his story ends. Though his life was hard and much too short, he lived it brilliantly.

Mandy Moore has a tattoo of what on her foot?

The ""Candy"" singer revealed the story behind her not-so-sweet tattoo when she made an appearance on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers"" on Monday night.

""About ten years ago, I was on tour with my band...when you go city to city you're on a bus, but you get a day room [in a hotel],” Moore told Meyers. ""I was the only girl, so I had my own room to shower and all the guys in my band shared a room.""

And it appears the boys had only one rule when it came to shower etiquette: No masturbating.

“It became this big joke, because one of my band members was like, 'I don't want babies on my feet,'"" Moore explained. ""And so we created a song called ""Babies on My Feet"" that we sang on stage every night. No one had any idea what we were talking about.""

Indeed, there's video evidence of Moore performing the unusual ditty from back in the day (above), but the band decided to take the inside joke one (permanent) step further by getting tattoos referencing the funny phrase.

",http://nypost.com/2016/08/08/you-wont-believe-why-espn-said-they-hired-jordan-rodgers/,"Jordan Rodgers didn’t just win JoJo Fletcher’s heart on “The Bachelorette.” He got his dream job, too.

The former Vanderbilt quarterback is set to appear on the SEC Network as a college football analyst this season, and an ESPN executive says Rodgers earned the role on his talent alone.

“Our talent office had Jordan on their radar for some time. His name was in the initial group of names that we discussed when looking at people to bring to Charlotte [where the SEC Network is located] for auditions,” Senior V.P. Stephanie Druley told SI.com. “He played at Vanderbilt. He played quarterback. We had seen some interviews that he had done. So we reached out to him.”

Rodgers was unavailable for an audition at the time. Druley claims the network didn’t know what show he was shooting that kept him away, though ABC and ESPN are both owned by Disney. When Aaron Rodgers’ youngest brother finally had his audition, he blew Druley away.

“It was clear he had a real passion and a deep knowledge of college football. The audition was really good — rare that someone walks in off the street and does an audition that we would be willing to air,” she said.

After Rodgers emerged as a front-runner on “The Bachelorette,” ESPN made him an offer a few weeks into the season.

“I had a real concern with how he would be viewed by fans of the show and what it might mean for him down the line,” Druley said. “He accepted the offer the day I was in an airport and saw Us Weekly with him splashed across the cover. Thankfully, the article didn’t live up to the headline, nor did a lot of the other ones I read.”

Rodgers has battled rumors he joined “The Bachelorette” for camera time instead of finding love. Though he and Fletcher are still engaged, his on-screen nemesis, Chad Johnson, called out Rodgers for using fame to his advantage.

Rodgers talked about his professional endeavors during a conference call with reporters last week.

“I’ve been doing broadcasting for the past year — doing radio for ESPN and doing some TV stuff here and there — and I’ll be working with ESPN and SEC Network as a college football analyst,” Rodgers said. “That’s the conference I played in. That’s kind of my knowledge base.”",2016-08-31 12:20:00

",http://www.nasdaq.com/article/youll-never-guess-how-much-money-the-marvel-universe-has-grossed-cm670369,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe, or (MCU) is a shared fictional universe focused on a series of superhero films that are based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics. In addition to feature films, it also includes comic books, short films, and television series. Films in the MCU have been split into three distinct phases.

It was acquired back in 2009 by the Walt Disney Co. DIS for $4 billion. Many were worried that the deal would both ruin beloved Marvel characters like Iron Man and damage Disney's financial standing and stock valuation. Fast forward to 2016, and Disney's acquisition could very well be one of the best things to happen to both the media giant and the comic book publisher.

However, it looks like the MCU is quickly coming to an end, at least as we know it. In an interview with IGN , Anthony Russo-who will be directing the upcoming Avengers films with his brother Joe-said that ""these two movies are intended to be the culmination of everything that has happened in the MCU since the very first Iron Man movie…In being a culmination, these movies are in some ways going to be an end to certain things, and in some ways, they're going to be the beginning of certain things.""

With this in mind, how much money has Marvel grossed at the total worldwide box office? And how much more can it bring in? Let's break it down:

Phase One

Iron Man - $585,174,222

The Incredible Hulk - $263,427,551

Iron Man 2 , bringing in $623,933,331

Thor - $449,326,618

Captain America: The First Avenger - $370,569,774

The Avengers - $1,518,594,910

Phase Two

Iron Man 3 - $1,518,594,910

Thor: The Dark World - $644,783,140

Captain America: The Winter Soldier - $714,121,534

Guardians of the Galaxy - $774,176,600

Avengers: Age of Ultron - $1,398,858,115

Ant-Man - $518,585,201

Phase Three

Phase three is just in its beginning stage, but will wrap up by 2019. The first of the last 10 films of the MCU, Captain America: Civil War , brought in almost $1.5 billion worldwide during its theatrical release.

Audiences can look forward to Doctor Strange hitting theaters this fall; Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , Spider-Man: Homecoming , and Thor: Ragnarok debuting in 2017; Black Panther , Avengers: Infinity War , and Ant-Man and the Wasp premiering in 2018; and Captain Marvel and the untitled Avengers sequel coming to theaters in 2019.

The Marvel Effect

As of now, the MCU has grossed $10,527,843,932 at the box office, and if the next nine films can live up to each of their respective predecessors, the franchise could very well double, and even triple, its worldwide earnings. Both of the next Avengers films could easily make $1 billion each, and if the next Guardians , Thor , and Ant-Man movies follow in common sequel fashion, they could all make well over their originals' total earnings.

Predicting gross profit from films is difficult, as Hollywood accounting is notoriously complicated, but it is safe to argue that Marvel has proven to be the ultimate money maker. Its films, comics, TV shows, merchandise, and all other revenue sources show that Disney made the entertainment deal of a lifetime.

Click here for 12 new Disney World attractions opening in 2016.

Walt Disney first built the park in 1971 as a supplement to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which the animation legend had opened 16 years earlier, on July 17, 1955. However, Orlando wasn’t the initial location that Walt considered for his second park. Plans had actually been drawn up in 1963 for an indoor theme park that was to be built in downtown St. Louis.

At the time, it made a lot of sense. Research showed that only five percent of Disneyland’s guests traveled from east of the Mississippi River, despite the fact that 75 percent of America’s population lived on that side of the country — and Walt desperately wanted the extra business. When the plans were drawn up, St. Louis was booming, the landmark Gateway Arch in St. Louis was under construction (it debuted in 1965), and Busch Stadium (est. 1966) was being built just a few blocks away.

However, the would-be Missouri Disney World hit a few roadblocks. Anheuser-Busch beer baron August A. Busch Jr. (who ran much of the city) allegedly insisted that the theme park sell beer, which Walt refused to do in the name of a family-friendly environment. Additionally, Disney was only willing to pay for the rides and attractions, hoping St. Louis’ redevelopment corporation would pay for the building that was to house them. The corporation balked at the idea, and Disney officially scrapped his plans in 1965.

According to 13 pages of blueprints that went to auction late last year, the plans for the St. Louis park included rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad — all of which are now fixtures at the Florida park.

In a new video for her app, Kim K reveals what it actually takes to have brows that perfect, and let's just say that it's not easy. First of all, she works with legendary brow artist and longtime pal Anastasia Soare of Anastasia Beverly Hills, which only comes to show that Kim K takes her brows very seriously. To put it into perspective, this is the woman who invented the Brow Powder Duo. Yeaaaaaah, kinda a big deal!

""Getting my brows done is not only a major part of my makeup routine, but it's also like a little therapy session. Anastasia will come to my house pretty much whenever, put her light on her head and go to work,"" Kardashian says.

Soare starts off by shaping the brows, which includes waxing any excess hair, as well as trimming the hairs with baby scissors. Then, she preps them by applying some eye cream and foundation around them to define their shape. This is a trick we've also seen her little sis Kylie test out—successfully, at that.

Soare says that highlighting under your brows will give you an instant lift.

She fills in sparse brows with a pencil and finally applies brow gel to set them in place. See, we told you it's not easy, but Anastasia clearly knows what she's doing!

And now, let's all marvel at the results:

Yep, totally worth it.",2016-08-18 13:00:00
66,"Pennsylvania.
",http://mashable.com/2016/08/02/netflix-tax-pennsylvania/#XIZiIpltaqqj,"Watch out: The ""Netflix tax"" is coming.

At least in Pennsylvania. The state legislature there recently extended its 6 percent sales tax to digital downloads and subscription services like Netflix and Hulu.

Though it's called the Netflix tax, colloquially at least, the fee will also apply to streaming and downloads for music, e-books and apps. Digital versions of newspapers, magazines and the Bible, will be exempt.

Pennsylvania joins a select group of locations that have begun to put local taxes on digital services. Chicago already has a similar 9-percent tax, often called its ""cloud tax."" Digital goods are also taxable in Minnesota. Similar taxes have come up in Canada. Netflix even battled in Kentucky over telecommunications taxes there, a way some states have tried to tax digital services without imposing a sales tax.

The sales taxes, like the one in Pennsylvania, are applied when a customer uses a billing address in a city or state with an applicable sales tax.

So if you want to avoid the Netflix tax, borrow a billing address outside the state. At least until the Netflix tax comes for us all, that is.

When and how to tax consumers buying services and goods from internet companies has long been a difficult question to answer. Amazon avoided charging sales tax for years before starting to charge it in some locations. Amazon now collects sales tax in 28 states.

One bill to charge online sales take, the MarketPlace Fairness Act, has been debated for years and remains up for debate.",2016-08-17 13:30:00

After two-and-a-half-years of reshoots, rewrites, stopping, starting and earning the nickname ""The Shut Down"", Baz Luhrmann's new Netflix series will finally air this Friday.

However The Get Down wasn't exactly cheap to make.

According to The Daily Telegraph, Luhrmann's new project has broken records before airing, being tipped as the most-expensive series Netflix has ever produced after the budget exceeded $120 million

The director has a history was going over budget - and film schedules - with his 2012 retelling of The Great Gatsby going significantly over budget.

Similarly to the Gatsby, Luhrmann went through numerous script writers for The Get Down, and according to Variety, ""two showrunners and every inch of the patience among executives at Sony Pictures Television.""

Despite this, the show, that chronicles funk music in the Bronx during the 1970s, has already received some decent reviews.

Indewire have called it Luhrmann’s best work since Moulin Rouge while The Hollywood Reporter have said the series thrives when Luhrmann’s influence becomes less evident.

“(Luhrmann’s) excesses work best in specific environments (Moulin Rouge) and less effectively in others (Australia, The Great Gatsby),” they wrote.

Jaden Smith stars in the series, alongside Jimmy Smits, Shameik Moore and Justice Smith.

72,With Jimmy Kimmel drawing a picture of a penis. ,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/07/matt-damon-jimmy-kimmel-couples-therapy,"Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Matt Damon has a new movie coming out this weekend, which means that once more, he’s set to do press with his arch nemesis: ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel. Damon and Kimmel, of course, aren’t real enemies; their faux feud goes way back to the early days of Jimmy Kimmel Live, when Kimmel decided on the spur of the moment that it would be funny to pretend to bump Matt Damon from his lineup; years later, Damon mock-reamed out the host when appearing on Kimmel for the first time in 2006. Their pretend bad blood has been a running gag ever since. (There are plenty of timelines on the Internet that go into excruciating detail of every parry and thrust in that made-up feud; E! has a good crash course.)

A decade later—and a full seven years since the feud truly climaxed with Sarah Silverman's “I’m Fucking Matt Damon”—there’s evidence that even Damon and Kimmel may be growing weary of their elaborate mutual vendetta. For proof, just watch the video above from Monday’s edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live, which is more of a “Kimmel vs. Damon” greatest hits montage than it is a new entry in the canon. Even the premise isn’t original; it finds the movie star and the comedian going to couples therapy, a gag they first explored just nine months ago:

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

That older clip, co-starring Dr. Phil, has over 5.5 million views on YouTube—indicating that there’s life within this old joke yet. But the new sketch—an 8.5-minute pre-taped bit that unfolds in a steady deadpan, with long, laugh-free stretches where you can almost hear the audience squinting and wondering when the jokes are coming—shows that both injured parties may be ready to bury the phony hatchet. That’s especially true in the bit’s ending, in which Damon and Kimmel turn to art therapy to work through their feelings.

Damon draws a picture of Kimmel with a butt for a face; Kimmel, predictably, draws a penis. Unpredictably, the image is enough to make Damon crack up—breaking character in a way that’s pretty much unprecedented for these sketches. Before long, Kimmel joins in; only their fake therapist keeps his composure. Maybe this means both men have finally decided to give up the pretense of pretending to fight. And if that’s the case, they’ve had more than a good run. (Perhaps Kimmel could try fake feuding with Jeremy Renner next?)",2016-08-10 15:22:43
73,"Hank Azaria debunks the fan theory that Moe goes along with Bart's prank calls.

",http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_579f3671e4b0e2e15eb642e3,"""The Simpsons""

On the very first day of this year, Jan. 1, 2016, a new “Simpsons” fan theory emerged that quickly inspired a viral amount of yellow journalism.

As the theory goes, famously cranky bartender Moe Szyslak has actually known all along that Bart Simpson is the notorious prank-caller that’s been bothering his bar since the very first season of the show in 1990.

Advertisement

The Reddit user that proposed the theory, Senor_Schnarf, argued that Szyslak is simply a family friend of the Simpsons and goes along with Bart’s pranks given he’s a lonely man who enjoys making the kid happy.

The most compelling evidence is that Bart’s phone calls to the bar are typically in the same exact voice ― every time ― and follow a beyond obvious joke structure. Szyslak also always goes out of his way to make the joke land.

As an example, in the Season 1 episode “Some Enchanted Evening,” Bart calls Moe’s bar and asks, “Hello, is Al there? ... Al. Last name: Coholic.” In that call, Moe could simply ask if there’s a Mr. Coholic or an Al, but instead yells, “Phone call for Al. Al Coholic. Is there an Al Coholic here?”

The running joke of Bart pranking Moe is one of the show’s most iconic bits. If this theory is true, you would definitely need to go back and re-watch all 27 seasons with the correct interpretations of the two characters to get an accurate understanding of the show. That would take a long time!

Advertisement

So with the opportunity to interview Hank Azaria ―the voice actor behind Moe since Season 1 ― about his recent Emmy nomination for a guest-starring role in “Ray Donovan,” The Huffington Post had to also ask how he felt about the fan theory surrounding his character and Bart.

Well, Azaria doesn’t believe the theory.

""The Simpsons""

Azaria, who voices more characters on “The Simpsons” than any other actor, first reacted to the fan theory by laughing. Then he said, “Uhh, that’s absurd. I never heard that before.”

Not an auspicious start for the theory, but Azaria did do a minor backpedal and said, “Wait, now that I’m thinking about it, he did sort of take a shine to Maggie. And he has often sort of ... ”

Advertisement

Azaria then paused what little credence he was affording the theory and continued, “But no ... I think Moe kind of is what he is. He hates pretty much everyone and has no patience for children.”

The voice actor went on to explain that Moe “is not the brightest bulb in the box” and summed up by saying, “that’s really all the explanation you need,” before laughing again.

To get a final nail to the theory’s coffin, HuffPost pressed on whether Azaria was definitely saying Bart has successfully been tricking Moe this whole time like the show makes it seem on the surface.

“Oh, yeah, I would say for sure,” said Azaria. “That’s how I’ve been playing it.”

",https://www.yahoo.com/news/making-murderer-fans-found-more-143032253.html,"making-a-murderer-teresa-halbach-bone-fragments

Netflix

Just because you spent over 10 hours watching the true crime documentary Making A Murderer on Netflix, that doesn’t make you a hardcore fan. That designation is only truly deserved by the scores of obsessed people meticulously going over every transcript and photo from the Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey trials. Internet sleuthing gets a bad rap these days, but it’s hard not to be impressed by the dedication these people have when it comes to figuring out what really happened to murder victim Teresa Halbach.

The latest discovery from this group comes from an analysis of the bone fragments pulled from the fire pit prosecutors accuse Steven Avery of using to burn Halbach’s body. During his trial they claimed his backyard bonfire burned so hot it obliterated her remains, leaving nothing but tiny bone fragment remains without any DNA left. But when fans took a closer look at the ‘human’ fragments collected, one stood out. Property tag 7955 included a bone that is clearly the carpometacarpus of a bird.

making-a-murderer-bird-bone-fragment

Case File

That brings us back to claims from the defense that Avery’s burn pit was regularly used to dispose of deer, rodents, and fowl remains from hunting. How many of the bone fragments collected and attributed to Halbach were just burnt animal remains? It also makes us wonder how a fire could be so powerful it reduced Halbach’s body to small flakes, yet this bird wing bone remained largely intact?

As with many of the key pieces of evidence in the Making A Murderer case, there’s a lot of controversy surrounding the bones found in Steven Avery’s burn pit. A proper forensic grid was never set up, and material from the pit was simply shoveled into boxes and sifted through back at the labs. Record keeping and chain of command protocols were largely ignored by the forensic labs, and the defense in Steven Avery’s trial complained “It is unclear whether some, all, or none of the fragments had been previously determined by the state’s forensic anthropologist to be human or not. In short, the defense has no way of knowing from this cryptic report what was sent to and examined by the FBI Lab.”

Story continues

making-a-murderer-bone-box

Case File / Making A Murderer

Steven Avery’s guilt was largely assumed by the public once news reports said Teresa Halbach’s remains were found in his back yard. But that claim, made so persuasively by prosecutor Ken Kratz during Avery’s trial, wasn’t backed up by much science. IDing the remains as Halbach’s was extremely difficult. The best the forensic labs could do was with one bit of tissue that had enough mitochondrial DNA for a test. But that test is supposed to give readings on 16 points of DNA in order to be usable. The lab could only get results on 7. Yet instead of reporting that as ‘inconclusive’, forensic scientist Shelley Culhane claimed the chances the mitochondrial DNA came from anyone other than Halback was “one in a billion.” This statistic is simply wrong — Someone checked out a single small mitochondrial DNA database of 65,000 people and found 122 matches at 9 points.

So you’ve got a single fragment of bone that gave a test result with less than half the required matching points to prove Steven Avery burned Teresa Halbach’s body on his property. That’s not a lot of evidence. Forensics didn’t have much better luck in Stephen Avery’s garage, where prosecutors claim Steven Avery executed Halbach with a hunting rifle. Not a single hint of Halbach’s blood was recovered from that crime scene, although a bullet found there in March (the initial investigation searches were conducted in November) was tested by Culhane, who found Teresa Halbach’s DNA on it. Interestingly enough, the DNA on the bullet was in the form of nucleated cells and not blood, just more ammunition for those who think evidence was planted by investigators.

The rabbit hole goes much deeper on the bones and DNA results, just another aspect of the Making A Murderer case that gets pretty iffy upon closer inspection. That’s one of the reasons people find the show so compelling, and why so many think season two of the documentary will feature Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey being cleared of killing Teresa Halbach. Avery’s lawyer Kathleen Zellner is filing her appeal at the end of August, and it’s guaranteed to blow the lid off this and many other inconsistencies in the case. She’s even said she intends to prove who Halbach’s real killer was as well. We’ll keep you in the know on any further updates on the case.

Tabloids have been speculating for months now on the status of their marriage. The couple have been sending mixed signals to the press and public for almost as long, never providing any affirmative answer.

Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck celebrated their eleventh wedding anniversary this week and it’s been almost a year since they publicized their separation. The couple is still seen together with their children. Case and point, their family trip to London and Paris last month while Ben Affleck was filming Justice League.

Neither Ben nor Jen will confirm or deny the divorce allegations. Ben still calls Jennifer his “wife” as he did during an HBO interview with Bill Simmons last week. Despite his unusual appearance on Any Given Wednesday, Ben Affleck was very clear once more how supportive Jennifer Garner was of him while he rebuilt his career.

But as recent as three weeks ago, Jennifer Garner had plans on divorcing her husband. So does Ben’s HBO appearance mean he still hopes they can reconcile? Does he still believe he can get Jen to come around and change her mind and not finally file divorce papers?

According to an exclusive ET Online report, a source quotes that they are making it work. They also come right out and say that they don’t know if they will ever get a divorce: “They still have not officially filed paperwork for a divorce,” the source reiterates.

ET also noted since their split, the two have established a co-parenting routine with ben remaining close to Jen and the kids.

They’re still legally married, but separated. They both live on their property in Brentwood California. Another source told ET: “They’re in a good place and co-parenting the best they can.”

Confused? ET did it’s best to get to the bottom of this conundrum. Do Ben and Jen know what they’re intensions are? Do they share every relationship up and down with the press and let the tabloids write what they will? Or, do the pair have things worked out and simply tell the press what it wants to hear in order to keep their lives private and press distracted?

Radar Online has an interview with Jennifer’s father after the devastating floods that hit West Virginia. Her dad remains mum about the status of his daughter’s relationship, saying he’d leave it up to the couple to discuss their personal lives.

People Magazine has published two conflicting stories. One friend of Jennifer’s says: “nothing has changed” in the relationship: “They’re still all about putting the kids first.”

Yet another report states that Ben doesn’t want a divorce and Jen has denied to friends that they’ve reconciled. The friend also said that Jen doesn’t mind that the divorce hasn’t been finalized, but she still intends on going through with it.

And to pile on more confusion, the same friend said that Jen really enjoyed her time with Ben and their kids in Europe. She liked spending time with Ben again. And yet another source said: “They have a lot of admiration and respect for each other”

So which is it? Will they or won’t they divorce? Will Ben Affleck and Jen Garner continue to play this game with the press, teasing the tabloids while not really giving them an answer? Or is Jen dangling the reconciliation worm before ben and is ben the one who’s being jerked about?

Now, it appears that Cosby and his legal team feel they have nothing to lose and are asking his accuser, Andrea Constand, to refund the money he paid her in a 2005 settlement, arguing that she and her lawyers violated the terms by cooperating in the criminal investigation against him.

The announcement came on Friday when Cosby's lawyers argued that the confidential settlement should be voided because the terms required Constand to tell him she was going to talk to police.

The 78-year-old comedian thinks that all the money, the amount of which is undisclosed, should be refunded. The judge didn't immediately rule on whether or not the supposed breach-of-contract suit could go forward.

While this recent announcement will do nothing for Cosby's public image, that aspect of his life maybe too far gone.

",http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1529909/when-star-wars-will-finish-filming-according-to-mark-hamill,"There are few franchises that truly inspire heavy fandom the way that Star Wars does. Since A New Hope first flew into theaters, American culture has been absolutely enamored with the galaxy far, far away, and entire generations have united together to watch the space opera and all of the colorful characters which it contains. As such, each new addition to the Star Wars canon is a cultural event, with droves of loyal viewers heading to the movies and attempting (sometimes in vain) to avoid spoilers. And since The Force Awakens was released in December, fans have been eagerly anticipating the next chapter of the main story, the still untitled Episode VIII. Luckily, we just got a little more information regarding the status of the next entry into the galaxy from none other than Luke Skywalker himself.

Mark Hamill has been pretty chatty regarding Episode VIII, most likely because he's actually in this movie for more than two minutes and actually has lines. Hamill most recently took to twitter to reveal when the cast and crew will be wrapping production for the untitled entry into the main canon, and it's real soon. Check it out.

There you go, you scruffy looking nerf herders. Production wraps on the next entry into the saga that is Star Wars in less than a month. So hopefully we'll be able to see some footage or teasers sooner rather than later.

Production wrapping for Episode VIII so soon is seems both exciting and hopeful regarding the overall quality of the mysterious sequel. Since we are not expecting the movie to hit theaters for another year and a half, this gives the producers, editors, and visual effects coordinators plenty of time to really make the film outstanding. The Force Awakens was gorgeous and felt like a chapter from the original trilogy, so Episode VIII will presumably attempt to do the same.

Rather than having to rush to quickly produce a movie for this December, the standalone film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will be released this year. The spinoff will successfully continue the hype and excitement for Star Wars fans, while also allowing post-production for Episode VIII to occur properly. Additionally, Rogue One will allow fans of the original trilogy (aka everyone) to go back in time a bit, and be re-introduced to the original characters that made the property so exciting.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will fly into theaters on December 16h, 2016.",2016-07-03 17:33:01

Kendrick, who has Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates hitting theaters in a few weeks, may not know much about comics or super heroes but she does have on particular Marvel character in mind should she ever suit up.

""My brother sent me a Squirrel Girl comic because he thinks I should [play her],"" Kendrick tells Net-A-Porter. ""I don't know what Squirrel Girl does other than be half squirrel, but I could be half squirrel!""

Kendrick would probably be a great fit for the ambitious and spunky Doreen Green. Her first encounter with Iron Man, when Squirrel Girl tries to impress him and convince him to let her join his super hero escapades, would be a blast having Kendrick riffing with Robert Downey Jr..

The inspiration to play a hero does have a source for Kendrick: Ryan Reynolds. ""Ryan is one of the most authentic people I've worked with; I can't think of a person more deserving of a hit like [Deadpool],"" the actress explains. ""He worked for so many years to get that film made because it's a character that was inside of him.""

Deadpool was very much a labor of love for Reynolds who pushed to get the movie made for years on end. It wasn't until some test footage leaked and the Internet went wild in support of a Deadpool film that Reynolds got to bring the character many say he was born to play to life on the big screen.

Will the same be said of Kendrick and Squirrel Girl?

",http://time.com/4384498/artist-vincent-desiderio-kanye-west-famous-video-sleep/,"Kanye West’s controversial video for “Famous” has been making headlines for its nude depiction of celebrities like Taylor Swift, Rihanna, George W. Bush, Donald Trump, Amber Rose, and Ray J tangled up in bed together, in a bizarre but intriguing tableaux of his oft-dramatic relationships with other celebrities. See the NSFW comparison here.

However, West, the self-proclaimed “greatest artist of all time” pulled major visual inspiration from another artist — realist painter Vincent Desiderio, whose 2004 piece, “Sleep” debuted at New York’s Marlborough Gallery and was later completed in 2008.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan, Desiderio — who is also a visiting critic at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts — reveals that he was not only supportive of the rapper’s artistic vision, but that he was happy with the end result.

“It’s an extraordinary and bold and different move for Kanye West,” he said. “And what I would say is that it is the clearest indication of his overall intentions as a person utilizing the media and working within it. I was absolutely floored and incredibly flattered and incredibly happy to see the video, which I think is really beautiful.”

Desiderio also disclosed that he found a kindred creative spirit with West, whom he respects as an artist in his own right.

“I think he and I are on the same page and he knows that, I know that. We both acknowledge that we are one brain, two bodies. He’s quite a remarkable man, not withstanding all the nonsense that accompanies a man strapped to a rocket, who sometimes is either misquoted or is compelled into a position that can frustrate someone.

Think of how Andy Warhol was intentionally misconstrued because he put himself out there to be misconstrued. Think about how his whole life was a performance piece and then you understand why Kanye at one point said, ‘I’m Andy Warhol.’ The way we’re thinking about Kanye West and the way he’s portrayed, there’s an orchestration to it, but social media is so large right now that it spins wildly out of control. Fundamentally, he’s an artist and I have total respect for him.”

The pair paid homage to their first outing as a couple by replicating their Rhode Island beach jaunt on the beaches of Suffolk, with not just one long walk on the beach, but two during a whirlwind 24-hour trip to the U.K.

According to the Daily Mail, the singer flew Hiddleston out to the U.K. on her private jet, accompanied by five bodyguards, because a getaway with an entourage is nothing if not very romantic. The pair then fittingly rented a “Bond-inspired” Jaguar and visited Hiddleston’s old stomping grounds, taking time to stroll on the beach with Hiddleston’s mother and sister.

As with all outings since this blossoming relationship started, it was faithfully documented by the paparazzi at a very close proximity, which is a real boon since Taylor has adopted a charming English country style since linking up with Hiddleston.

Stay tuned for more beach dispatches from Team Hiddleswift; after all, a couple that walks beaches together will probably, maybe stay together.

Well, turns out, ""Becky"" took her good hair and ran straight out the building as soon as she saw Queen Bey coming.

According to Page Six, Rachel Roy hastily left the building as soon as rumors started circulating that the Carters were dropping in on the event unexpectedly — of course, it's not like Bey would RSVP — to avoid Bey's death stare.

Whispers of the Carters surprise arrival started as soon as the lights went down. One fashion writer tweeted, “Jay Z has just arrived... What could it mean?” Then Beyoncé’s daughter, Blue Ivy, and mom, Tina Knowles Lawson, showed up, making it clear that the Queen was on her way.

Roy, apparently, took that as her cue and dashed before Beyoncé entered the building. “She disappeared with her place card and never came back,” said a source. ""[It was] weird. I don’t know if it was because she’s ‘Becky,’ or what?” Another stunned source at the event said, “Rachel just came and left.”

While Rachel's official excuse is that she had to catch an early flight to LA to be with her kids, this latest display of bizarre behavior isn't doing anything to squash those Becky rumors.

We would say let this be a lesson to anyone who crosses Beyoncé, but that's already perfectly clear.

Star Wars: The Force Awakens hits DVD shelves in less than a month, which will undoubtedly prompt diehard fans to comb the film for mistakes and easter eggs they hadn’t noticed in theaters. But there’s one gripe that’s been eating away at fans for months: a random exchange and awkward snub involving Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey that takes place near the end of the film. (In other words, there are major spoilers ahead, so please proceed with caution if you’re one of the three or so people in the world who somehow hasn’t seen this movie.)

The scene in question comes just after Han Solo’s death at the hands of his own, weirdly emo spawn, Kylo Ren. The crew of resistance fighters return to Starkiller base with the bad news and with the injured Finn in tow, and Leia seems to sense what happened to her estranged husband. She looks to her friends for comfort, but for whatever reason, she brushes off Chewbacca and hugs Rey instead. This was weird because Leia’s known Rey for all of, like, two seconds, but mostly because Chewbacca was Han’s partner-in-crime, and a lifelong friend of both Han and Leia. So why would she snub him like that?

Director J.J. Abrams recently caught up with Slashfilm, where this very topic was discussed at length. And while Abrams admits it was a “mistake,” he chalks it up to an unfortunate matter of positioning and blocking.

“That was probably one of the mistakes I made in that,” Abrams said. “My thinking at the time was that Chewbacca, despite the pain he was feeling, was focused on trying to save Finn and getting him taken care of. So I tried to have Chewbacca go off with him and focus on Rey, and then have Rey find Leia and Leia find Rey. The idea being that both of them being strong with the Force and never having met, would know about each other -- that Leia would have been told about her beyond what we saw on-screen and Rey of course would have learned about Leia. And that reunion would be a meeting and a reunion all in one, and a sort of commiseration of their mutual loss.

Lucasfilm

“Had Chewbacca not been where he was,” Abrams continued, “You probably wouldn’t have thought of it. But because he was right there, passed by Leia, it felt almost like a slight, which was definitely not the intention.”

Some fans have taken Leia and Rey’s embrace as a hint at Rey’s lineage -- was Leia drawn to her because Rey’s part of the Skywalker bloodline as well? Whatever the case may be, we can only hope Leia and Chewbacca kiss and make up in Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: Episode VIII, which hits theaters on Dec. 17, 2017. Patience, friends.",2016-06-23 13:30:00

The actor has invested in everything from a garbage company to an Amazonian tea purveyor and the popular mattress startup Casper, as documented on Crunchbase. His latest move involves sinking some cash into Qloo, a startup that bills itself as a “cultural recommendations engine.”

So how does it work? Qloo says it has “mapped the taste genome” by combing through massive amounts of data. Then, it spits out answers to burning questions from brands and advertisers about the preferences of their target audiences when it comes to things like food, music and TV. For instance, as TechCrunch reports, Qloo can tell you the favorite music artists of fans of the Golden State Warriors vs. fans of the Cleveland Cavaliers. That’s no small thing: it helps advertisers ensure they’re marketing the right things to both groups, collectively or separately, based on what they do and don’t share. (For instance, Warriors fans like Drake and Cavs fans like Li’l Wayne, but both groups like pizza and SportsCenter.)

The Series A round, which DiCaprio participated in, raised $4.5 million for the company. DiCaprio certainly has eclectic taste in investments; only time will tell if this endeavor will reap the same kinds of rewards he’s been bringing in with his work on the big screen.

The whale speech makes a comeback in this weekend's sequel Finding Dory, and we actually learn how Dory learned the language, but the story about how Ellen learned the language is an even better one. She spent one vacation listening to whale sounds for an extended period of time, and the bizarre experience stuck with her.

The cast and crew of Pixar's Finding Dory were part of a talk at Google recently when one attendee asked Ellen Degeneres how she learned to speak whale. She also asked the question partially in whale, because this is Google and the company is full of nerds. Ellen then told a story about being on vacation in Hawaii and finding her rental house next to a woman who would spend her days doing fairly mad levels of yoga, all while listening to an album of whale sounds.

I didn't know you could buy that record, but there's a record that just is whale sounds. And I was listening to it...and it was just the weirdest thing I'd ever seen in my life

This experience gave Ellen Degeneres an intimate, if unwanted, familiarity with the sounds of whales, so when Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton asked Ellen if she would ""speak whale"" for the film, she knew exactly what to do. Stanton, for his part, thought Ellen would veto the idea without a second thought, but instead, she dove in.

It's not all fun and games, however. According to Ellen Degeneres, there are downsides to speaking whale.

It's not easy...if you have to do it a lot it's very, it's tough on your vocal chords. You have to kind of warm up.

There's actually quite a bit of whale spoken in Finding Dory as a major character in the film is Destiny, a whale shark. A whale shark is actually a shark, not a whale, but one should apparently not tell Destiny that.

112,To see how the crowd reacts. ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1524030/why-jeff-goldblum-plans-to-sneak-into-a-movie-theater-showing-independence-day-2,"Roland Emmerich makes movies that demand to be seen on the big screen. Not just a big screen. The biggest screen possible. From the monumental explosions of Independence Day (pun intended) to the planet-rattling chaos of 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow, Emmerich specializes in sequences that fill every inch of the screen with practical and digital madness. Which is exactly why Jeff Goldblum plans to see his latest collaboration with Emmerich -- Independence Day: Resurgence -- in a theater, with a paying crowd, to appreciate how they react to the insanity.

Late last year, I was lucky enough to travel to New Mexico and watch Emmerich at work on the set of Independence Day: Resurgence. It looked like a massive undertaking, and I peppered the cast with questions about the process of working on such an epic blockbuster. Jeff Goldblum, over the course of one of his answers, talked about the joy of seeing one of Emmerich's movies with a crowd, and told me the following reason why he plans to sneak in while the movie's playing and enjoy it with a public audience:

You've asked the right person... because I do like to watch movies. ... I'm thinking of several scenes. It's a spectacular... once again, you can imagine, there's much spectacle. I will tell you this. There's more spectacle than I have seen in any... I think it moves the ball, it raises the bar, whatever metaphor I'm stupidly trying to think of, ahead. So it's going to be something that, even though you think you have seen everything before, you'll go, 'I never... That's bigger, and more than I thought!' So some of that. And I'll enjoy that. And like the last one, it's got some heart, I believe. Roland Emmerich is a person of soulful wisdom and humanity. Once again, he's very interested and passionate about creating characters that, for him, tell a story of loveliness and love, of comradeship and some very touching and sweet and funny things. He's got a very keen sense of humor. So I'm hoping that those moments will be delightful in those ways. And I can imagine, you know, watching it with the audience!

If you can believe it, during that last bit of his answer, Jeff Goldblum actually pantomimed himself eating popcorn, surrounded by an audience as they enjoyed Independence Day: Resurgence together. This is only part of his incredible explanation of the joy of working with Roland Emmerich, so you really have to watch the above clip to get the Full Goldblum, as I now like to call it.

Roland Emmerich's Independence Day: Resurgence takes place 20 years after the original film. Humanity is using alien tech acquired from our original encounter with the intergalactic species to bolster our planet's defense systems. Only, the aliens are back... and they are better prepared. Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner reprise their original roles in the sequel, joining newcomers Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Joey King, Sela Ward, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Jessie T. Usher. The movie will be in theaters on June 24. And if you go on opening weekend, look around. You might be sitting next to a wide-eyed Jeff Goldblum. Tell him we said hello.",2016-06-16 16:10:00
113,Merlin the Magician (seriously). ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1523940/what-transformers-5-may-be-about,"At this point, there simply shouldn't be anything that surprises you when it comes to the plot for Transformers movies. They're about giant robots who turn into cars and planes, so it's not like incorporating Arthurian legend into the mix really makes the premise that much more bizarre, does it?

How the human characters, played by Mark Wahlberg, and a returning Josh Duhamel, will fit into all this is unclear. The fact that those details appear to be missing from this plot would appear to indicate that the rumors that the franchise would be moving toward focusing more on the robots and less on the people may be true. A number of previously appearing Transformers have also been announced for Transformers: The Last Knight, though, if you're actually capable of telling them all apart, you're a better man than I. The film is currently filming in Cuba.

While seeing a new Transformers movie is probably not something on your bucket list, the fifth entry in the franchise is on the way, so we'd better all just get used to the idea. Production is underway on Transformers: The Last Knight and we know something about which characters will be returning and a few of the robots in disguise who will be in play. Now, some details about the plot appear to have been revealed, and in true Michael Bay fashion, they are batshit insane. Apparently The Last Knight subtitle is some sort of reference to the King Arthur myth. No, seriously.

The Transformers films aren't exactly known for their cogent storytelling, but if the word on Transformers: The Last Knight is accurate, the series is about to achieve a new level of bonkers. According to JoBlo, the new film will open with Optimus Prime discovering the Transformers' home planet of Cybertron, but what he finds is a dead husk of a planet, which he, somehow, is responsible for destroying. The good news is that returning Cybertron to life is possible if Optimus can just obtain a MacGuffin, er artifact. If you just guessed that the artifact is located on earth, you win the grand prize. There's a bit more to it, however, as the artifact is related to Merlin the magician, who, it turns out, received his magic from an early Transformer, because of course he did.

If there's anything that actually makes any sense based on this plot, it's the casting of Anthony Hopkins. He seemed like an odd choice for a Transformers movie, and while that's still true, at least now we have an idea where he'll fit. If he's playing a human, he'll probably be Merlin himself, because you'd want a big name to take on a role like that. Either that or he'll simply be a Transformer with an English accent, because you know that's going to happen. Transformers: The Last Knight will be in theaters on June 23, 2017.",2016-06-16 14:00:01
114,"June Moon, aka Enchantress...maybe. ",http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Who-Main-Villain-Suicide-Squad-May-135487.html,"The next DCEU movie to hit theaters will mark one of the weirdest and boldest comic book adaptations ever committed to the silver screen. Suicide Squad hasn’t even premiered yet, and it’s already obvious that the film has taken every possible left turn to set itself apart from what we expect from this genre. David Ayer has a vision in mind, and from what we’ve seen, it seems delightfully fresh.

However, despite the fact that we’re beyond excited for the upcoming release of Suicide Squad, we seriously know nothing about the film’s actual villain. Sure, it will be undeniably awesome to see these characters coalesce on the silver screen for the first time, but the trailers and marketing materials have done very little to inform us of the overarching conflict. What looming threat arises that causes Amanda Waller to bring this group of psychos and killers together? We’ve gone through the details, and come up with five potential big bads that could take center stage once Suicide Squad hits theaters on August 5.

Enchantress

Based upon everything we’ve seen from the Suicide Squad marketing campaign thus far, it seems as though June Moone a.k.a Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) has the strongest chance of taking on the film’s villain role. She’s featured prominently in the film’s trailers – consistently looking quite sinister – and her magic-based powers seem to line up with our understanding that the Suicide Squad will fight magical forces not quite within the realm of science. However, in some many ways, June Moone and Enchantress are two completely separate entities, so it remains to be seen whether or not the titular Squad will have to take down both of them, or just the evil witch persona.

Joker

Recent reports from early screenings of Suicide Squad seem to point to the fact that Jared Leto’s Joker may have no more than 20 minutes of screen time in the final cut of the film. That being said, that doesn’t rule out the possibility that he’s the mastermind behind all of the destruction and carnage we see. It wouldn’t feel too surprising to learn that he’s pulling the strings and manipulating everyone from behind-the-scenes. It could be to lure out the Batman, win back Harley Quinn, or simply to cause chaos everywhere he goes. At this point, nothing from this character would surprise us.

Tattooed Man

Although the Tattooed Man’s presence in Suicide Squad has not been officially confirmed, many eagle-eyed comic book fans seem to have picked up on the notion that rapper Common will indeed portray the relatively obscure character. Typically known as a Green Lantern villain, the Tattooed Man has the ability to manifest constructs from tattoos inked into his skin. The official designation of Common’s character is ""Monster T,"" and a monster featured briefly in the film’s trailers seems to match up with this particular villain’s known abilities, so all eyes are on the Tattooed Man to potentially be the one to cause a major headache for the titular team of super villains.

Lex Luthor

Numerous unconfirmed rumors have persisted for quite some time that Jesse Eisenberg’s Lex Luthor would potentially pop up at some point during the events of Suicide Squad for a cameo. He’s currently rotting in a jail cell, and for Amanda Waller to have him transferred to Belle Reve would make a great deal of sense. For him to be the ultimate mastermind behind the events of the film would most certainly help the universe establish his conniving intelligence in a way that Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice simply failed to do. It would also help expand the reach of the DCEU, making an instant connection between Dawn of Justice and David Ayer's Suicide Squad.

Someone Else Entirely

Like I already said: Suicide Squad seems like one of the best-kept secrets in the entire superhero genre right now. All of the aforementioned characters seem poised to take on villainous roles in some form or another, but there could very well be another threat looming in the wings. Perhaps new facts of the DC lore will receive ample exploration with this one supervillain team-up. The film will reportedly take place in Midway City, so maybe the Thanagarians will show up and cause some trouble. At this point, we will just have to wait and see how it all pans out when Suicide Squad hits theaters on August 5.

115,"It MAY be called ""Weapon X."" ",http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Wolverine-3-May-Have-Title-It-Makes-Perfect-Sense-135527.html,"While the most recent chapter of the X-Men saga is barely behind us, the next chapter is already hotly anticipated. This is because we know that we’re getting ready for the final performance by Hugh Jackman in his iconic performance as Wolverine. Much has been rumored, but little is actually known, about what Wolverine 3 is all about, but now we can add one more rumor to the list. The newest rumor regards the film’s actual title, which will sound familiar to those who know Wolverine, even though the title apparently won’t include his name. The word is Wolverine 3 will be called Weapon X.

All of our rumors up to this point have implied that Wolverine 3 would take inspiration from Old Man Logan, a comic that sees the character much further along in life, not in the early Weapon X days. This makes the report from Gamezone seem odd, yet, their sources, which they make a point to insist are reliable, are claiming that Weapon X will be the film’s title. While this might not be the title many were expecting, it actually makes perfect sense. The Weapon X program was the experiment that turned Logan into Wolverine and what he went through there has been a key part of his character since the first X-Men movie. We fully expect that Wolverine 3 will be some sort of true finale for the character, and so that may very well mean finding some closure with the experiment that created him.

The first Wolverine standalone film X-Men Origins: Wolverine dealt specifically with the events of the Weapon X program, however, that film was viewed as one of the weak links in the X-Men franchise to date, and its events were essentially retconned out of existence following X-Men: Days of Future Past. The end of that film saw Logan end up in the hands of William Stryker once again, about to undergo the same experiment, so while we know the events still happened, at this point we expect they happened somewhat differently.

Naturally, calling Wolverine 3 Weapon X also forges a connection to the type of cameo that Hugh Jackman filmed for X-Men: Apocalypse. As that scene concluded, the feral Wolverine ran off into the night. Could this film build on that conclusion?

This shrouds the characters' past in some mystery once again, If the film is called Weapon X, but is also taking inspiration from Old Man Logan, perhaps the plan will be to fill in Wolverine’s new history via events that take place in the future, thus completing the character before we say goodbye to him. This connection could also act as the introduction for the character of X-23, the female Wolverine clone, whose character has been rumored to appear in the new film. Maybe the experiments are up and running once again and it falls on a former subject to shut them down?

What do you think of Weapon X as the title for the final Hugh Jackman Wolverine movie. Does it work? Does it need Wolverine’s name somewhere in the title? Weigh in below.",2016-06-16 10:40:01
116,"Disney wants a more happy ending like in the classics, and the reshoots will also tie into Episode 4 - A New Hope. ",https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-rogue-one-reshoots-ordered-studio-unhapp/1100-6440339/?ftag=GSS-05-10aaa0a,"Anticipation is high for the next Star Wars movie, the standalone film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which hits cinemas in December. The first trailer was released in April, but now it has been reported that the film might be in trouble and the studio is demanding reshoots.

According to Page Six, executives at Disney are unhappy with the first cut that director Gareth Edwards has delivered. The site's sources said: ""The execs at Disney are not happy with the movie, and Rogue One will have to go back into four weeks of expensive reshoots in July. Disney won't take a back seat, and is demanding changes, as the movie isn't testing well.""

Reshoots on big budget films are not uncommon, and Page Six quoted a source at Disney who defended this decision. ""The filmmaking team and the studio always anticipated additional shooting and second unit work to make the film the absolute best it can be, and the actors were aware there would be additional shooting,"" the source said. ""Coming off The Force Awakens, there's an incredibly high bar for this movie and we have a responsibility to the franchise and to the fans to deliver the best possible movie we can.""

Neither Disney or Edwards' representatives have commented officially on the story.

This isn't the first time that rumours have circulated about potential problems with Rogue One. In January it was reported that Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation writer/director Christopher McQuarrie had been hired by Disney to rewrite the script, and that he had ""saved"" the movie. McQuarrie has a reputation as one of the most in-demand script doctors in Hollywood, and his work on World War Z helped turned a troubled, overbudget movie into a hit.

A number of people involved with the production of Rogue One have spoken about the different approach that Edwards was bringing to the film. When the cast and crew were first announced last year, Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy described how the film ""goes into new territory, exploring the galactic struggle from a ground-war perspective.""

Last month, star Riz Ahmed told Movieweb: ""What Gareth is bringing to Rogue One is [an] incredible, organic, loose, kind of a raw feeling. He speaks about it in terms of a war movie. And he compares it to other war movies. We're doing something a little different to the other films. And hopefully people are ready for that.""

Rogue One is set before the original Star Wars, and focuses upon a group of mercenaries who are hired to capture the plans to the Death Star. The cast also includes Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Forest Whitaker, and Mads Mikkelsen. It hits cinemas on December 16, 2016.",2016-06-16 08:50:00
117,Cersei Lannister. ,http://mashable.com/2016/05/03/game-thrones-heir/?utm_cid=p-fb-traff#lHxBPJzBTRqW#tM_nynXzQuqL,"Update: This post, written after Game of Thrones Season 6, Episode 2, explains the legitimacy of certain events in Episode 10. We've added some brief notes based on the rest of the season, so don't proceed if you haven't seen it.

The body count in Westeros is really starting to pile up -- and the return of one resurrected Lord Commander doesn't begin to make a dent in the numbers.

In Season 6's first two episodes, three of the Seven Kingdoms' most powerful leaders have been usurped and unceremoniously tossed on the scrap heap: Roose Bolton (along with his wife and hours-old heir), Balon Greyjoy (last of the participants in the War of the Five Kings and the last of the leeches burned in the fire by Melisandre) and Prince Doran Martell of Dorne (that guy in the bathrobe and wheelchair).

But the most important death is the one that barely got any attention: the poisoning of Princess Myrcella Baratheon, sister to King Tommen and official heir to the Iron Throne. She was the last Baratheon in Westeros -- legally speaking, at least -- and her absence has the potential to create even more of a power vacuum in Tommen's already ineffectual reign.

Credit: GIPHY

If Tommen were to die without producing any offspring, there'd be no official heir apparent -- a fact that doesn't seem to have occurred yet to his mother Cersei or biological father Jaime. So far, apparently, neither has thought to do what any real-life monarchy would do in this situation: assure the world loudly and often of a secure succession.

Which would be an easy and indeed pleasant duty for them -- if they'd only hit the books to find out who the successor is.

(Note that this is not the case in the Song of Ice and Fire books on which the show is based. George R.R. Martin has kept Myrcella and Stannis alive thus far; he also didn't have Stannis's daughter and heir, Shireen Baratheon, burned at the stake. At this stage, the showrunners are far more murderous than the famous author.)

So who is next in line to the Iron Throne of Westeros on the show, presuming Tommen's death leads to a peaceful and legal transfer of power? The answer might surprise you. But buckle up, because we're going to need to do some serious time traveling through Westeros history.

Even in real life, royal lines of succession can be hard to grasp. First of all, it isn't simply about who is descended from whom. There are several hundred royals in Europe who have more right to sit on the throne of England than Queen Elizabeth II, for example, but they are barred by dint of being descended from the Stuarts, a line of ousted Catholic English kings.

Similarly, if the Baratheons died out, legally and politically speaking, you couldn't simply hand the Iron Throne back to Daenerys, daughter of the Targaryen king that King Robert Baratheon ousted. Once a new dynasty seizes a throne, there's no going back except by force. And Dany's chances of doing that are looking pretty slim at the moment.

Sorry Dany, Dragons don't count when it comes to the line of succession. Credit: HBO

So to find out who would replace Tommen, we have to go through a convoluted Baratheon family tree, find out who married whom, and end up in another House altogether.

But first, a side note: Yes, technically there is a son of Robert Baratheon still alive in the show. His name is Gendry, the only one of Robert's bastards to survive Cersei's massacre. But he is still a bastard, and to ascend to the throne he'd have to have the current king legitimize him.

That's hardly likely, of course, even though Gendry has Baratheon blood in him and Tommen (secretly, sort of) doesn't. The air in King's Landing is thick with irony.

Robert Baratheon

King Robert and his lethal drinking horn. Credit: HBO

The leader of Robert's Rebellion acquired the throne by force. He had three kids, officially and legally at least, with Queen Cersei. Joffrey and Myrcella are dead, leaving only Tommen -- and if the prophecy Cersei received from a witch is to be believed, the other blond-haired kid isn't long for this world either.



The Throne would then pass to Stannis Baratheon, if he weren't pushing up daisies near Winterfell, then his faithful daughter Shireen Baratheon, if she weren't in cinders, then his younger brother Renly Baratheon, if he weren't in an advanced state of decomposition post-shadow baby.

That exhausts this generation of Baratheons. And according to this unbelievably extensive Baratheon family tree, you have to go all the way back to Robert's great-great-great-great-grandfather to find anyone in his family who sired another line that survived.

A hundred and fifty years before Robert was even born, an aristocrat called Corwen Baratheon married a woman named Leyne and had six kids. One of them, Arion, was Robert's great-great-great grandfather. The next one down to have surviving kids was Elyanna, who married a Lord named Mathin. Lord Mathin Lannister.

Mathin fathered Jason, who fathered Demon, who fathered Gerold, who fathered Tytos Lannister. And who was Tytos' firstborn son?



Tywin Lannister

If you were still alive, you'd be here by now. Credit: HBO

Yep, that's right. The old puppet-string puller, Lannister Godfather and Hand of the King could have sat on the Iron Throne in his own right! That is, if he hadn't ended up looking down the business end of Tyrion's crossbow while sitting on the commode.

That being the case, however, his title of heir to the throne of Westeros passes to his firstborn son ...

Jaime Lannister

He's alive and intact! Well, apart from that right hand. Credit: HBO

There's a problem here, however -- Jaime is Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. That's a lifetime post, one you don't simply leave, even if it is to become King. Cersei may want him to rule, but we get the sense that Jaime's sense of honor wouldn't let him leave the Kingsguard even if the small council bent the rules for him.

Update: Jaime was removed from the Kingsguard by Tommen in order to help the Freys capture Riverrun. In theory, that should make him Tommen's heir -- which might explain why he didn't look too happy at Cersei's coronation.

So if Jamie is passed over for the post, what about Tywin's second-born son?

Tyrion Lannister

'King Tyrion, first of his name' has a ring to it. Credit: HBO

Though a peaceful transfer of power to the Imp would be one of the most delicious things we could ever witness in a future Game of Thrones, it's also less likely to happen than Jaime's ascendancy.

You may remember that small matter of Tyrion being convicted and sentenced to death for regicide. He's officially a traitor who lost his trial by combat thanks to an overly-cocky Red Viper.

Even if that somehow didn't legally bar him from the throne, even if his exile thousands of miles away were no impediment and even if he didn't have Mereen to rule over, Cersei would personally slit every throat in Westeros before she'd let her little brother wear the crown.

Besides, Tyrion has made friends with dragons now. What does he need with a dumb throne made of sharp swords?

So unless the Imp intends to steal those dragons from Daenerys and seize power with them himself, the title of heir to the throne of Westeros passes to ...

Cersei Lannister

No longer just Queen Mother. But at what cost? Credit: HBO

Yeah, you read that right. Tommen's rightful heir to the Iron Throne, the next ruler of the Seven Kingdoms if he doesn't get busy with Margaery, is his own mother -- via the most convoluted route of succession imaginable.

Did we just blow your mind?

It doesn't just make sense from a genealogical perspective. It would also be storytelling dynamite.

Picture it: Cersei, fearful of the prophecy and utterly torn apart by the deaths of all her children, is forced to take their place on the throne as she mourns. The ultimate underhanded player of the game of thrones would win it, ironically, by legal means. And the victory would taste like ashes in her mouth.

Perhaps the only sweet part about it for Cersei would be the ability to lord over Margaery again, presuming Margaery will be freed from the Sparrows' clutches at some point. That scene would be the exact opposite of one from Season 5, and would be worth it just to see Cersei swilling her giant wine goblet and destroying her rival with a devastating put-down.

Update: Now we know Cersei was able to remove the threat of Margaery as part of her attack on the Sept -- which may not have left time for a vengeful put-down, but was certainly effective.

Is any of this likely to pass? Not necessarily. The whole of Westeros is under threat from a winter nobody has prepared for, and from the once-in-a-thousand-years civilization-ending threat of the White Walkers. To the east, even if there is no invasion fleet any more, there be dragons enough to cause serious damage. And Dorne, post-coup, is likely to be in full-scale rebellion.

The Baratheon-Lannister dynasty's chances of retaining control of King's Landing in the face of all those enemies seems vanishingly slim. But if the show and the books have taught us anything thus far, it's that you never, ever count this family out.

Update: Turns out the ""Cersei becomes Queen"" scenario was more likely than we suspected. But now you know it was a legitimate ascension to the Iron Throne, and not a coup by the Queen Mother.

Jorah gonna want to read this, ""Game of Thrones"" fans.

With our favorite characters in jeopardy every week on ""GoT,"" we're always looking for any clue or indication of who's about to go next. And no one looks more in danger these days than Jorah Mormont.

In addition to his life-threatening greyscale, actor Iain Glen is now playing a media mogul, à la Richard Branson, on a new show called ""Cleverman."" So now we're really worried.

Does Glen's participation in ""Cleverman"" hint at Jorah's fate?

""I don't think you can draw that conclusion,"" Glen reassured The Huffington Post when addressing our concerns. (Thank the old gods and the new!)

The actor explained that, although it appears ""Game of Thrones"" has a long production process, it's really only shot for half of the year with two units working in tandem. Contrary to popular belief, Glen says new projects are not a good indicator of whether or not a character doesn't make it on the HBO series.

""They've always been amenable to actors doing other work around it. Your guess is as good as mine as to whether Ser Jorah survives into the future. They keep us painfully in the dark, so well just have to see,"" he said.

Even if this season could mark the end of Mormont, fans can take comfort in the fact that Glen's new show is a lot like ""Game of Thrones.""

""Cleverman"" is an Australian-New Zealand fantasy series about what happens when the world of mythology collides with our own. Like ""GoT,"" it explores class and politics, and there's even some monsters and heart-eating, too.

Yum, right?

Though ""Cleverman"" may not have the same budget as ""Thrones,"" Glen says a big similarity is that the show's supernatural aspects enhance the story rather than distract from it.

""I think in 'Cleverman,' there are these supernatural elements in it, but you never get to the point where they bounce you out of the story and say, 'Well, I don't really believe that situation,'"" he told HuffPost.

Glen enjoyed shooting and would be totally up for Season 2 if it happens, which is fine with us. If we don't have to worry about Jorah, then now our ""Cleverman"" watch begins.

UPDATE: ""Cleverman"" has been renewed for Season 2, according to Deadline. Production for six more episodes will begin later this year.",2016-06-16 04:45:00

",http://mentalfloss.com/article/81564/it-cost-10000-show-bea-arthurs-face-deadpool?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Partner&utm_campaign=DYK,"Small celebrity roles and cameos can deliver a major blow to a film's budget, even when the star is only on screen for a matter of seconds. In the DVD commentary for Deadpool, lead actor and producer Ryan Reynolds reveals that it cost the project about $10,000 (which dwarfs what some crew members make on big budget films) to have his character wear a tank top illustrated with actress Bea Arthur's face, Empire Magazine recently reported.

In the comic books, Deadpool is Arthur's self-proclaimed ""number one fan"" and likes to watch episodes of The Golden Girls. The writers even named the spaceship for the Deadpool Corps ""The Bea Arthur"" in her honor. So, it seemed natural for the actress to play a role in the film—at any cost. In the commentary track, Reynolds said that showing the tank top in the film was ""potentially cinema's most expensive Easter Egg ever,"" adding that ""as a producer, I had to approve that $10,000 … You can’t have a Deadpool movie without Bea Arthur.""

122,"Because she ""kind of"" likes her weapons. ",https://fraghero.com/megan-fox-wants-to-play-kitana-in-new-mortal-kombat-film-for-the-weirdest-reason/,"Megan Fox is a well known pop culture face. Not because she’s starred in her own comics or is part of a popular video game, but it’s because she’s played key roles in popular movies such as Transformers and Teenage Mutants Ninja Turtles.

She’s all set to return this summer as April O’Neil in the upcoming Turtles movie titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. However, Megan isn’t planning to rest and wants to further grow her fan following as she’s looking forward to playing more popular characters, and this time she wants to fill in the boots of a popular fighting game character.

She revealed during an interview with Cinepop when asked if she wanted to play any superhero in a movie, that although she has no idea about a superhero but she’s really keen to play the role of Kitana, the badass hottie from the Mortal Kombat series.

I’ve been getting this question a lot and I should think about it more because I keep drawing a blank. I don’t have a specific superhero that I think I should play. I’m sorry I don’t have a better answer for you I don’t know.

As you all know Kitana isn’t a hero in the series but plays the role of an antagonist. She’s a badass that shows no mercy to her enemies, and is the daughter of Sindel and Shao Khan (adopted).

I thought of Kitana from Mortal Kombat if they ever make that movie again. I’ve always loved her fans and the blades, um, but that’s the only one I could think of.

That’s it, she wants to play the role because, um, she kind of likes the blades. To each their own I guess, but I’ve seen better reasons given by celebs for reprising the roles of fictional pop culture icons in the past. Let’s just leave it at that.

There are whispers that a new Mortal Kombat movie is actually in development and might be helmed by James Wan, who’s directed Fast and Furious 7 among other films. The last Mortal Kombat movie released way back in 1997 and was titled Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.

The film met with a moderate reception and under performed since the original Mortal Kombat movie raked in more revenue at the box office, which is one of the reasons why the series has been in hibernation for so long.

Would you like Megan Fox to play the role of Kitana in the upcoming Mortal Kombat movie?",2016-06-15 21:02:00

124,Production staff doesn't communicate about it in written form. ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1523960/how-jurassic-world-2-is-keeping-its-secrets-according-to-bryce-dallas-howard,"After the massive success of Jurassic World last summer, its upcoming sequel -- temporarily known as Jurassic World 2 - is without question one of the most anticipated movies currently in development. Of course, that means that the project has to take serious considerations where detail leaks are concerned, and one star has revealed exactly how it's doing that. According to Bryce Dallas Howard, information about Jurassic World 2 is being kept hidden by basically not being communicated about in written form.

The actress recently took part in an early press day for her upcoming movie Pete's Dragon, and I had the pleasure of sitting down with her for an interview. After a long discussion about her work on the Disney movie (more on that in a bit), we concluded the chat talking about Jurassic World 2 and director J.A. Bayona taking the helm. Bryce Dallas Howard mentioned that she's been communicating with the filmmaker, and that she was actually going to be seeing Jurassic World director/producer Colin Trevorrow later that day, but also noted that it's weird talking about the sequel because of the restrictions on communication. She explained,

Whenever I have the chance to be around that group, that crew I like get information. [laughter] J.A.'s over in Europe right now, so I haven't seen him in person. I'm sure he wouldn't... because you know what, the emailing and texting, you can't go on record. You can't write anything down, commit to anything in writing. So, tonight I'll just be like, 'Can you verbally explain to me what's happening?' But we'll shoot it next year.

Studios and filmmakers are constantly looking for ways to prevent details about their upcoming projects leaking to the public, and one could see this being a very effective way. Sure, one can imagine that there's a risk of some material getting scrambled if stuff isn't being written down, but not putting anything in texts, emails or memos means that nobody is going to see material they aren't going to see (and at the most extreme level, it's safe from hackers).

Jurassic World 2 has been seriously in the works for a while now, with J.A. Bayona coming aboard about four months ago. As Bryce Dallas Howard mentioned, the plan is to start filming next year, with Universal Pictures having put a flag in a June 22, 2018 release date. Howard will reprise her role as Claire Dearing, and Chris Pratt will be back as Owen Grady, and while Colin Trevorrow told us that a big theme of the movie will be the proliferation of dinosaurs, not much is known beyond that.

We'll hopefully have more news for you about Jurassic World soon, but you can next see Bryce Dallas Howard in theaters in Pete's Dragon, which will be arriving in theaters on August 12th.",2016-06-15 14:57:00

What about the new American wizard school in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?

Ilvermorny is the name of the school and the four houses are: Horned Serpent, Wampus, Thunderbird, and Pukwudgie.

The Horned Serpent is a dragon-like serpent with long horns and teeth. They are said to be able to control the weather, particularly rain, lightning and thunder. They can shape-shift, turn invisible and perform hypnosis.

Wampus is a cat-like creature that is pretty much a very scary looking cougar.

Thunderbirds are legendary birds that can generate storms and thunder when they fly. A Pukwudgie is a 2-3 foot tall human like thing with exaggerated ears, fingers, and nose. They have smooth grey skin that glows sometimes. They can disappear and reappear, create fire, and transform into either a porcupine or a cougar.

There is still more to learn about these houses and Ilvermorny. We’ll find out more November 18, 2016 when Fantastic beasts charms its way into theaters.

We were first introduced to Annie Ilonzeh during her days on General Hospital. Today, you can catch her every week on Empire as she stars a persistent journalist, Harper Scott. The Nigerian-American actress who hails from Dallas, Texas is one of 5 girls in her family and notes that she grew up in a frugal home. “We didn’t have the luxury to get our nails done all of the time,” notes Ilonzeh. She’s a tomboy at heart with girl next-door appeal that prefers sweats to evening gowns, and has a serious knack for at-home nail art.

When she’s not on set, writing or living her best fit life at the gym, it’s likely that you’ll find her nestled in the comfort of her home jamming her favorite songs and doing her nails. “I was a manicurist in another life,” she states. “Being pampered is great, but sometimes I like to do those things myself because it’s a little therapeutic and gives me some downtime for myself—and I need that,” she states. Between readings and 14-hour set days, some down time is definitely needed. Ilonzeh’s go-to polish is anything nude, she admits to hoarding nude polish and finding it hard to resist buying a new shade (we hear you, girl!) The perfect finishing touch to her manicure? An accent nail—and we’re not just talking a basic polish change. Ilonzeh goes the distance and experiments with jeweled accents, caviar finishes and marbled art—yea, it’s serious! She’s a beauty minimalist after our own hearts!

For anyone who was a ""Friends"" devotee, it seemed apparent there was something lovably wrong with Lisa Kudrow's character, Phoebe Buffay.

The beautiful blonde never quite seemed all there in the hit NBC sitcom. She referenced having a strange past multiple times on the show, too.

Phoebe told other cast members at various points during the 10 seasons that her mother was a drug dealer, that she hung out with a group of friends behind a dumpster, and that she had been homeless.

One ""Friends"" fan took Phoebe's checkered past and turned it into a dark theory about how the series should have ended, and it has gone viral.

The fan, @strnks on Twitter, posted the theory a few days ago and it has gotten attention on publications like Time and Daily Mail. In @strnks' eyes, the show shouldn't have ended with Ross, Rachel, Monica, and the gang walking out of their apartment, leaving the keys on the counter.

It should have ended just with Phoebe sitting in the friends' favorite haunt, Central Perk, staring out the window. In this alternate ending, Phoebe would have been a meth head, creepily staring out the window at five people who are actually friends — Ross, Rachel, Joey, Chandler, and Monica — and daydreaming up the whole 10 seasons, mentally inserting herself into what she assumes their lives are like.

""All 10 seasons were merely her fevered imagination,"" @strnks writes, ""projecting herself into the lives of the others. All she ever wanted was... Friends.""

Apparently, the brains behind that McDonalds jingle, you know the one, I'm Lovin' It, is none other than rapper Pusha T.

Former record company exec Steve Stoute, who now heads up his own marketing business, recently chatted to New York-based radio station, Hot 97, and revealed the inside information.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBlD2N_AwgI

He said that it was one of the first projects his marketing firm, Translation, looked after.

According to Pitchfork, the information came about when Hot 97's Ebro Darden initially referred to the jingle as the work of Pharrell and Justin Timberlake.

Stoute wasn't long putting him right and apparently said: ""No you know who did that? Pusha T"".

So, JT sang but it was Pusha T who came up with the slogan and the jingle.

134,"JD in ""Thelma and Louise."" ",http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Famous-Role-George-Clooney-Hates-He-Lost-Brad-Pitt-135547.html,"Brad Pitt and George Clooney, quietly, have made a ton of great movies together. The real-life friends have collaborated on everything from Coen Brothers comedies to a trilogy of Ocean’s capers. But back in the day, the two reportedly went out for the same roles, with Pitt getting the better on Clooney for at least one specific role that haunts the one-time Batman to this day.

Decades ago – long before he played Tyler Durden or Benjamin Button – Brad Pitt was cast as the handsome thief J.D. in Ridley Scott’s Thelma & Louise. Naturally, Pitt’s looks and charisma helped earn him the part, but as it turns out, he edged future bestie George Clooney for the role. Geena Davis, who played Thelma in Sir Ridley’s classic, recalled that she learned this fact while sitting opposite Clooney on a flight. As she recalls:

At one point, he says to me, ‘I hate that Brad Pitt.’ And I say, ‘No you don’t. He’s your good friend, right?’ And he said, ‘Oh, I hate him because he got the part in Thelma & Louise.’ And I said, ‘Did you want that part?’ And he said, ‘Couldn’t you tell when I read with you?’

Only, according to Geena Davis, she had no recollection of reading with George Clooney for the part! She was so enamored with Brad Pitt – who, to be fair, looks like a god constructed from perfect clay – that she hardly noticed Clooney, and didn’t recall meeting him until that day on the airplane, years later. Davis tells the whole story on The Late Late Show With James Corden, and it’s really worth a listen:

Now, when Thelma & Louise would have been casting (in 1989 or ’90), George Clooney was a TV actor whose “greatest” cinematic credit was playing Matt Stevens in Return of the Killer Tomatoes. He’d appeared on The Facts of Life, and was starting to make a name for himself playing Roseanne Barr’s supervisor, Booker, on the sitcom Roseanne.

But he hadn’t yet become “George Clooney, International Superstar,"" and it probably cost him a significant role. Of course, both Clooney and Pitt ended up doing just fine. But could you imagine Clooney as J.D. in Thelma & Louise? Would the part have worked just as well without Pitt’s outlaw charms?

Clooney isn't the first actor to deeply regret passing on a role. And he won't be the last. But I don't think he regrets it nearly as much as these actors, who ALMOST played superheroes but, for reasons we may never understand, passed on the chance. Some of these still hurt!

Mel Gibson as Odin in the Thor movies? We're not sure that we can actually see that, but according to the Lethal Weapon actor, it almost happened. Gibson admitted this while promoting his latest movie at the Cannes Film Festival, and without even realizing it, he helped himself join an exclusive club of actors who had been offered prominent roles in superhero franchises, only to pass (for various reasons).",2016-06-11 10:46:00

We’re told Khloe made it clear to Lamar from the time he almost died last year … she was dropping the divorce because she wanted to help him get better. She vowed not to re-file until he was able to run his own life day-to-day, and she believes he’s at that point right now. (TMZ)

Some people love Iron Man, other people love Thor; Marvel legend Stan Lee is no different. Over the years, he has struck up a strong relationship with many people within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This begs one interesting question: which MCU actor has Stan Lee bonded with the most over the franchise's eight-year history?

Stan Lee recently made an appearance on Larry King Now, and he was able to quickly answer that question when the host raised the issue:

Chris. The fellow who plays Captain America, he was the Human Torch and then they made him Captain America and he’s the greatest guy, but I love them all.

So it seems that Chris Evans and Stan Lee have developed a bond unlike any other shared between members of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That being said, Stan Lee does sort of hint that Chris Evans has a bit of an advantage over other Marvel actors. As he portrayed the character Johnny Storm, a.k.a The Human Torch, in Fantastic Four, as well as Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, he has had the opportunity to meet Stan Lee prior to the very existence of the MCU.

Of course, being the nice guy that he is, Stan Lee doesn’t entirely play favorites. He makes sure to note that he loves all the actors who play his beloved heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he has managed to strike up strong bonds with all of them over the course of the last eight years. Still, let's not forget that Captain America was one of the first superheroes he ever worked on.

Chris Evans is an actor who has really grown into his role as the Marvel Cinematic Universe has worn on. He seemed like a decent fit when Captain America: The First Avenger hit theaters back in 2011, and with each successive film he has seemingly become more and more comfortable with the role of Steve Rogers. In fact, as time has worn on he has arguably become one of the pivotal faces of the MCU—even rivaling the iconography of Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark on numerous occasions. He plays the role of the Star-Spangled Avenger so well, it’s not hard to see why Stan Lee respects him so much.

Barone portrayed Carol in The One With The Sonogram At The End, when she famously turned up at Ross' (David Schwimmer) museum and announced she was pregnant with his child, having recently left him for a woman. We then saw her have her first sonogram with Ross and her lover Susan at her side, giving viewers a glimpse at what would turn out to be Ross' son Ben.

But that was all we saw of her.

When next we saw Carol, in The One Where Underdog Gets Away, she was not only bigger from being several months pregnant, but she was being played by a totally different actress (Jane Sibbett).

Barone left the show, presumably completely unaware how massive it would become, because the part apparently wasn't big enough.",2016-06-06 11:44:00

""Kylie had been bankrolling Tyga for well over a year and she's finding herself short on cash as a result,"" an insider said. What's even more pathetic is the rapper reportedly thought the insane amount of money was Kylie's way of saying ""I love you.""

145,Bob Ross' Beauty is Everywhere on June 1st. ,http://trib.al/wReXvgO,"The show we’ve all been waiting for has finally made it’s way to Netflix. It’s possibly the single most relaxing television show ever in existence, and we now have access to it whenever we want. Get excited, because Bob Ross is back.

In case you need a refresher, Bob Ross made a name for himself with his show The Joy of Painting, which aired on PBSfrom 1983 to 1994. Ross’s soft spoken voice and his incredible painting skills made for the most calming TV experience one could ever hope for in the ’80s and ’90s. Not to mention his trademark curly hair that made him instantly recognizable.

But just so everyone’s clear on what to expect — Netflix isn’t streaming The Joy of Painting, but rather Beauty Is Everywhere, a series that was filmed in 1991 a few years before Ross died of Lymphoma at age 52. The format is nearly identical to the original show, the only difference is, you probably haven’t seen any of these 25 episodes.

Netflix is promoting the show with the completely accurate tagline, “His teachings are eternal. His hair is immovable. He is Bob Ross.” false",2016-06-02 13:43:58

At 34 years old, Ivanka Trump has many titles: wife, mother of three, entrepreneur (she’s launched fashion, jewelry and lifestyle collections, as well as her growing initiative, Women Who Work), writer, and businesswoman. But how does she juggle it all and look so good doing it? Here, she gives us a little glimpse into her world.

NewBeauty: Being that you travel often, especially on the campaign trail, do you have any beauty hacks for busy women who are always on the go?

Ivanka Trump: It’s so important to stay hydrated while traveling. It’s an easy hack, but drinking lots of water really helps you to stay glowing and energized during long trips. When I can, I drink lemon with my water—it dresses it up a little bit!

IT: Take off your makeup before bed, no matter what!! As a teenager, my mother once woke me up in the middle of the night to insist I remove my makeup. She felt like it was terrible for the skin, and I tend to agree.

NB: What do you want to teach your daughter about beauty?

IT: It’s crucial to me to impart to Arabella that confidence, strength and grace are what really makes a woman beautiful. The makeup and skin care are fun, but it’s who you are as a person that matters the most.

NB: Do you have any post-pregnancy tips for women to bounce back so quickly like you did?

IT: I started thinking more about the nutritional value of food—rather than purely eating for pleasure—during my first pregnancy and have tried to maintain that thinking between my last two pregnancies. I may eat more now (I have even added breakfast, which I always used to skip), but in a healthier way. As far as an exercise routine, I love to run. My team at IvankaTrump.com and I ran a half-marathon last year and I’ve become addicted to the endorphin boost!

IT: One of the greatest perks for our Spa Suites guests at Trump National Doral are the in-room offerings, including a bath butler service for a lavishly prepared, unforgettable bath experience. All of the Spa Suites feature deep soaking tubs and women can mimic the experience in their own homes by taking some time out after a long day, drawing a warm bath with aromatherapy salts, lighting a few candles and enjoying a couple minutes of pure relaxation.

NB: Do you have a favorite spa treatment?

IT: As a working mother of three, it’s not often I get to enjoy a spa treatment, but when I do, I love a classic deep tissue massage. This is especially helpful right now, as my neck and back are always sore from carrying around my two toddlers and infant son.

Thankfully for Jay and Bey fans, it’s a good one. Word is the two have been working an entire album together. And it’s safe to say the speculation of problems in their marriage served as a good distraction to keep fans from finding out what was really going on between them. Interestingly enough, this now not so top secret album will touch on the rumors that have been making their rounds on the Internet.

A source confirmed the news with Page Six and said Sunday, “Jay and Beyonce were never going to do an interview to address all the questions that came up after Lemonade. It’s more their style to respond through music.”

Lemonade is Beyonce’s sixth studio album. She switched gears this time around and premiered it as a visual album on HBO April 23 (which fans got to enjoy for free). Jay Z’s appearance paired with Beyonce’s lyrics caused fans to think she was finally spilling the real details about trouble in their marriage. Let’s just say that in one line she urged him to go get “Becky with the good hair.”

Stars from celebrity stylist Rachel Roy to celebrity chef Rachael Ray were accused of being Becky along with Rita Ora.

Beyonce and Jay Z’s new album is said to be hitting Tidal sooner than later.",2016-05-31 16:01:00

At this point in the series, fans of both the show and the books know there’s one major character who hasn’t yet been introduced at all. Well, to be fair, there are lots of major characters who haven’t (and won’t) be introduced, this one is different. Her name is Lady Stoneheart and we already have met her. Sort of.

Lady Stoneheart is the resurrected corpse of everybody’s favorite Tully turned loving Stark, Catelyn. In the books, the brotherhood without banners takes the Lady’s corpse (Thank you, Red Wedding) and brings it back to life (and we know from Arya’s time with them that they totally have the capability to do it). Many fans of the books were surprised that the character hasn’t yet shown up in the series since she has a major hand in the fates of other characters.

There was some speculation that the show may just skip over the character altogether and find other ways of getting to the same fates. People also thought that maybe the showrunners didn’t want to show a major character’s resurrection because it would take away from the (year-long) speculation about Jon Snow’s death. But now that Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are both headed to Riverrun (where Lady Stoneheart, aka Catelyn Stark, happens to be from) to deal with her brother the Blackfish, all the dominos are finally in place for the character’s big reveal.

And, from what we know of Lady Stoneheart, she will definitely make an entrance (you know, if the show decides to bring her in).

This season has already been filled with tons of stories of resurrection, both literal and metaphorical. From Jon Snow’s most obvious return to the resurrection of Arya Stark (with her reclaiming Needle and seemingly giving up her quest to give up her identity and serve the Faceless God) to Daenerys’ return to her rightful place as Khaleesi, it would definitely fit with the season’s overall theme. And it’s likely no coincidence that another Stark we thought was dead just happened to pop up, resurrected and transformed, in the last episode.

Hopefully we can see this badass character make a memorable appearance. And, while they’re at it, maybe we can bring back Robb Stark just, you know, because? (*SWOONS AND CRIES FOREVER*)",2016-05-31 13:56:57
149,It's A Small World. ,https://shar.es/1dFVVu,"When the folks over at This Exists heard that Natalie Imbruglia’s 1997 smash hit “Torn” has been played on Australian radio over 75 times a day for over a decade, they were amazed. Then, they had a follow up question: What’s the most frequently played song in the world?

It isn’t “Torn” (though seriously, 75 times a day?), but the top ranking tunes might surprise you. “Yesterday” by The Beatles has been broadcast over 7 million times since it was released (OK, not surprising), but The Righteous Brothers actually have the Liverpool quartet beat. Their “You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling” has been played over 8 million times on radio and television since its release in 1964.

Still, the reigning champion runs circles around even that. Here's a hint: It belongs to a theme park ride and has been played 50 million times.

It should be noted that the metrics for this kind of ranking are tricky. For one, there’s now the internet, where people are doing a lot of their music listening these days. We see you, Psy.

151,"Newest theory, Poe is her brother. ",http://hellogiggles.com/theory-reys-possible-family-means-crazy-things-next-star-wars-movie/,"For all the lightsabers, X-Wings and Wookies, Star Wars has always been, at its heart, the ongoing story of the galaxy’s most dysfunctional family. Now, if one recently revealed fan theory turns out to be true, you can expect the familial drama to get even messier in Episode VIII.

According to Reddit user Beeslo, there’s a chance that scavenger turned (possible) Jedi, Rey, and the best pilot in the resistance, Poe Dameron, could be siblings. While finding false connections between characters is pretty common place in Star Wars fandom (remember when we were all convinced Emperor Snoke was actually Jar Jar Binks?), Beeslo actually has some not-totally-crazy evidence to back up their claim.

In the Star Wars universe comic Shattered Empire — a story that bridges the gap between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens — we’re introduced to Force Trees. These are trees that, as you can probably guess, are imbued with the living force. At the end of the four-part series, Luke Skywalker bestows a Force Tree on to a trusted friend, a pilot named Shara Bey. Shara plants the tree outside of her house, which she shares with her young son, Poe Dameron. That certainly helps explain what makes Poe such an insanely talented pilot — he was absorbing the Force every time he went to play in his family’s backyard!

poerey.jpg Credit: Lucas Film

From here Beeslo begins to theorize that maybe Poe wasn’t an only child, maybe his parents gave him a little sister. And if just hanging out around a Force Tree can give you Force powers, imagine how powerful a kid conceived near one would be. Honestly, this makes us feel a little bad for Poe. It’s never easy when your younger sibling turns out to be better than you at everything. Imagine how he’ll feel when he discovers his little sister, Rey, is an advanced level Force user while he’s never even wielded a lightsaber before.

Obviously the theory isn’t one hundred percent sound. For one thing, Rey and Poe don’t share any screen time in The Force Awakens. It’s hard to imagine that the filmmakers wouldn’t even hint at such a gigantic relationship. Then again, there were no real hints in A New Hope that Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader shared any kind of lineage. Maybe we’re just being kept in the dark for an Empire-sized reveal.",2016-05-27 12:33:52

Wednesday's episode of the popular puzzle game hosted by Pat Sajak featured two contestants, LaToya Williams and Danielle Gilseth, each amassing $24,000 in cash and prizes leading up to the bonus round.

A tie is exceedingly rare on ""Wheel of Fortune,"" where players compete to solve hangman-style word puzzles. In fact, the last time such a stand-off happened was more than 10 years ago, according to syndicator Sony Pictures Television.

The producers then offered the pair a tie-breaker round.

See 'Wheel of Fortune' blunders:



Williams won the tie-breaker, then proceeded to a bonus round where she solved the puzzle: ""POUR YOUR HEART OUT.""

""I feel great,"" Williams said after finishing the bonus round. ""I thought I was going to pass out.""

All told, she took home $125,000 in cash and prizes, including a trip to Costa Rica.

""Wheel of Fortune"" is the No. 1 syndicated game show and is renewed through at least 2018. The format was created by talk-show host Merv Griffin in 1975 and has run in syndication since 1983.

156,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever. ,http://www.ozy.com/acumen/whats-the-worst-movie-ever/65509#.V0YRe37ATGE.facebook,"Entertainment was pretty great in 2002. We had singer Jennifer Lopez, footballer David Beckham, pop girl group Las Ketchup, young Brad Pitt. But perhaps it ought to be remembered for a big flop, headlined by familiar blockbuster stars Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu. Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (2002) might be the worst movie ever made, according to critics.

100 percent of the experts on Rotten Tomatoes rated Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever as “rotten.”

That’s right: 115 out of 115 critics — let’s be honest, a pretty huge sample size — would take back the 90 minutes stolen from them, rating the film a green splat rather than a well-rounded tomato. Critics, when asked to rate it out of 10, gave it a measly 2.6, and general audiences gave it an even lower 2.2. “Sometimes it’s surprising how stupid moviemakers think we are,” John Wilson, founder of the Razzie Awards, which celebrates the worst movies every year, says. Representatives of Ballistic’s director, Wych Kaosayananda, did not respond to a request for comment.

Lucky for Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, it has some company in the zero-percent club. There’s Orgy of the Dead, Return to the Blue Lagoon and National Lampoon’s Gold Diggers. But these other movies have far fewer critics weighing in, so the criticism of Ballistic has more oomph … more than any of its explosions. Full reviews skewered it more specifically: for plot holes, trying unsuccessfully to be like The Matrix, incoherent writing, clichéd tropes and difficult-to-follow storytelling. “It was one bad surprise after another,” critic Nell Minow says, looking back. Personally, we couldn’t hold it together every time the intense background music started up in a fight scene.

Today we live in a kind of golden age for cult movies, where ironic love of cinematic failures from the past can bring people to late-night movie screenings and yield book deals years later to rehash the disastrous experience on set. Bad-movies aficionado Emer Prevost, who runs the YouTube channel “Reaction & Review,” says that Ballistic won’t cut it, though, as a cult movie. It takes a special kind of bad to also be entertaining. “I took the DVD down to a local shop the next day. They said they could give me 60 cents for it. I said, ‘Good. Take it,’” Prevost says.

Of course, Ballistic probably won’t get to keep its place in bad movie history forever. Every year, the Razzies choose new terrible movies. Look back through time and the epitome of worst movie has changed as consistently as Ballistic’s characters’ motivations. Tastes differ on what’s not just bad but horrendous: Some say The Room is the worst; others, Plan 9 From Outer Space. And in all fairness, not everyone despises it. Critic Michelle Alexandria says, “I don’t watch action films for story or even acting. A good action film only has to deliver on the action for me.” So maybe make that 115 out of 116 critics.

CEO Mike Hopkins hasn't said yet which networks and shows will be available when the new programming starts, but we're crossing our fingers that the major broadcast (Fox, NBC, ABC) and cable (TBS, Bravo, Showtime) networks will join in. Hulu also announced that, like Amazon and Netflix, it's expanding its movie library. It has signed a deal for exclusive rights to a Beatles documentary from Ron Howard, which will be the first of many new documentary movies to be available on the platform. And for those who miss Dr. Mindy Lahiri, the fifth season of The Mindy Project will also be returning to Hulu.

""I was adamant,"" she added, but said the run-in ultimately didn't pan out. ""He knew I was looking for him,"" she told Norton.

The star hasn't kept her distaste for Trump a secret.

“If Donald Trump becomes president, that will be the end of the world,” Lawrence told Entertainment Weekly in October 2015.

The actress added that Trump's straight talking persona was especially disconcerting to her.

“I was watching him on the campaign trail and one guy said, ‘I love Donald Trump because he’s saying everything I’m thinking and I just can’t say it because of the PC factor.’"" she added. ""And I’m thinking, ‘You are absolutely right. That’s who I want representing my country, somebody politically incorrect. That will just be perfect,’”

Women who have spoken up against Trump experienced major backlash.

As ATTN: has previously reported, after feminist artist Ilma Gore depicted Trump with a micropenis, a supporter of the presumptive GOP nominee allegedly physically attacked her near her home in Los Angeles.

In January, Fox host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly faced a barrage of sexist slurs from Trump supporters after he demanded she be replaced by another moderator during future GOP debates.

After former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields alleged that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski forcefully moved her out of the way while she was trying to ask the candidate a question after a March press conference, Fields suffered a barrage of abuse from Trump supporters on social media.

Conservative news outlet the Blaze also obtained audio of an individual allegedly making death threats to Fields.

While a few choice Trump supporters have slammed Lawrence on social media, whether the actress will endure the massive online attacks reported by Fields and others remains to be seen.

162,The producers said a female toy wouldn't sell as well. ,http://trib.al/NGrNtGd,"Once upon a time, Iron Man 3 was going to have a female villain, a true first for the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a few reasons. One, simply being, FEMALE VILLAIN! Two, a female character would have been front and center with plenty of screen time. Unfortunately, this story doesn’t have a happy ending whatsoever, because that female villain never made it into the final version of the movie. Why? Because no one wants to buy a female villain toy, duh.

In a new interview with Uproxx, Iron Man 3 director Shane Black explains that many of the females in the movie had their plots drastically reduced before the movie ever began filming. When discussing Rebecca Hall’s character of Maya — a botanist who has a flight with Tony Stark and then ten years later ends up working for the bad guy — Black explains that in a very early draft of the film SHE was actually the villain behind everything. Until it came time to talk tie-in toys for the movie.

“We had finished the script and we were given a no-holds-barred memo saying [a female villain] cannot stand…because, after consulting, we’ve decided that toy won’t sell as well if it’s a female,” Black states. “So, we had to change the entire script because of toy making.”

WOW. Wow wow wow. If you’ve seen Iron Man 3, you know that Hall’s Maya starts off really strong at the beginning of the movie, and slowly fades into the background. The end of her story is [spoilers, for 2013’s Iron Man 3, but come on] she’s killed by the real villain, The Mandrin. But she was supposed to be The Mandrin.

“[Marvel] called and said, ‘[With a female villain] that’s money out of our bank,'” Black continues. “In the earlier draft, the woman was essentially [Guy Pierce’s] Killian – and they didn’t want a female Killian, they wanted a male Killian…they just said, ‘no way.'”

Black makes it clear that it wasn’t Marvel who got rid of the idea of a female villain, but rather the company behind the toys for Iron Man 3. They believed they wouldn’t sell, and told Marvel they’d lose out on all sorts of $$$, and well, you can see where this is going.",2016-05-16 19:00:47

164,“My Way” by Frank Sinatra. ,https://shar.es/1dXxRj,"We’ve all gotten talked into doing karaoke at some point or another, or maybe it’s one of your secret passions (I’m not judging). Whatever circumstance leads you to the stage on karaoke night, here’s a tip: Avoid “My Way” by Frank Sinatra. It doesn’t matter if it’s Rat Pack night. It doesn’t matter if you happened to wear your best fedora. It doesn’t even matter if you could be a voice double for Ol’ Blue Eyes himself. If you value your life, do not allow yourself to be seduced by “My Way” when you see it in the selection book—it’s literally a killer.

In 2007, a man was performing the song in San Mateo in the Philippines when a security guard loudly informed the singer that he was off-key. When man continued to croon, the guard pulled out a .38 caliber pistol and shot the performer in the chest, killing him.

Freak occurrence? Nope. Since 2000, at least half a dozen people have been murdered after (or while) performing the Sinatra classic. Dubbed the “‘My Way’ Killings,” the strange phenomenon has gotten so bad that some bar owners have removed it from the selection list entirely.

Theories abound as to why this particular song seems to evoke such violence. It could be that the song is just so Sinatra that anyone else who sings it is bound to pale in comparison. It could be, according to singing school owner Butch Albarracin, that the lyrics inspire “pride and arrogance in the singer, as if you’re somebody when you’re really nobody.” Pop culture expert Roland Tolentino believes it’s all about location—these killings have all occurred in the Philippines. “The Philippines is a very violent society, so karaoke only triggers what already exists here when certain social rules are broken,” he said.

While the “My Way” Killings do seem to be limited to a certain locale, karaoke rage seems to happen all over the world. My advice: The next time you find yourself with a microphone and a screen of lyrics in front of your face, opt for something—anything—other than Sinatra.",2016-05-14 23:20:46

Have you ever clicked on an exciting link or potentially explosive news story, only to find yourself watching the 1987 Rick Astley hit 'Never Gonna Give You Up'? Then you’ve been rickrolled, my friend.

A classic bait-and-switch scenario, the meme is as popular now as it’s ever been.

“I think it’s just one of those odd things where something gets picked up and people run with it,” the eponymous singer told the L.A. Times in 2008. “But that’s what's brilliant about the Internet.”

He originally rose to fame in the 1980s, scoring number one singles in the UK, a platinum-selling album, and even a Grammy nomination. But after millions upon millions of views, how much money has the rickrolling prank raked in for its star?

Well, as of 2010, he has received the princely sum of…$12.

This is because Astley didn’t write the song, so he only receives a performer’s share of the sound recording copyright.

Astley doesn’t seem to have any hard feelings about rickrolling.

“Listen, I just think it’s bizarre and funny. My main consideration is that my daughter doesn’t get embarrassed about it.”

And despite the prevalence of the meme, he has no plans to remix or re-release the song to cash in on the phenomenon.

“I don’t really know whether I want to be doing that,” he said. “I’m not being an ageist, but it’s almost a young person’s thing, that. I think the artist themselves trying to remix it is almost a bit sad. No, I’m too old for that.”

167,No. ,http://nerdist.com/does-sean-bean-really-die-more-than-other-actors/,"One does not simply… assume.

Actor Sean Bean has been dying over and over again for 20 years. He’s been dropped from a satellite dish in Goldeneye, shot through the neck with a grappling hook in The Island, peppered with arrows in The Lord of the Rings, and decapitated in Game of Thrones. But with the number of Sean Bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show Legends, maybe it’s time to put the many demises into perspective.

Start looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times. A long enough career can rack up the kills. For example, Robert de Niro has died on screen 19 times. Other stars like Leonardo DiCaprio have died 9 times. So where does Sean Bean fall along this list?

I crafted the following chart to find out:

Click to enlarge!*

It looks like the “walking spoiler” meme has a grain of truth to it. While Bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them — almost a third of his films.

However, even though Bean has perfected his “I’m dying” face, he still hasn’t died the most on screen. Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies.

But the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt. With over 120 movies, Hurt’s death percentage is similar to Bean’s — around 30% — but just seeing the list of Hurt’s 43* deaths is impressive.

He has died in The Wild and the Willing, Sinful Davey, A Man for All Seasons, 10 Rillington Place, The Ghoul East of Elephant Rock, Spectre, Alien, The Elephant Man, Heaven’s Gate, The Osterman Weekend, The Hit, After Darkness, The Black Cauldron, Jake Speed, Spaceballs, Aria, Deadline, Little Sweetheart, Scandal, L’Oeil qui ment, Monolith, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Contact, The Climb, All the Little Animals, You’re Dead, Lost Souls, Hellboy, Pride, Tabloid, The Proposition, V for Vendetta, Outlander, Boxes, An Englishman in New York, Ultramarines, Whistle and I’ll Come To You, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Only Lovers Left Alive, Snowpiercer, Hercules, and finally the TV miniseries I, Claudius.

Maybe it should be #DontKillJohnHurt.

So is Sean Bean a walking spoiler alert? For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park‘s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths/episode.)

Of course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt). In the years to come, we could see Boromir bite the dust enough to become the undisputed duke of the death scene.

168,"He cast for looks. He compensated by ""turning his back"" when directing a scene. ",http://www.mentorless.com/2016/05/10/how-orson-welles-compensates-for-mistake-in-casting/,"How Orson Welles Compensated for a Mistake He Kept Making When Casting

I have a massive crush for this video interview with Orson Welles shot in Paris in 1967, when the man had fully embraced his persona.

Shot in a restaurant, while eating, surrounded by journalists hanging to his every word, Welles talks about a mistake he has found himself making over and over again during casting, and how he found a way to compensate it while shooting.

So here is what Welles says:

“When I’m casting, I tend to make the mistake of all producers and metteurs en scène (directors), I cast for how you look. I think about (the voice) but how you look is the first consideration.

And then, when I have them on the stage I’m very interested in their voices and it’s too late to change, unless you dub them. I make that mistake a lot. (…)

I think that if (a film) sounds wrong, then it doesn’t look right. Movies depend so much on rhythm. They are so close to music, closer to music than a drama of the theater, that if the sound, and the rhythm of the sound, above all the rhythm, is wrong, no image can save it. Because the rhythm of the sound… I believe sound is the first human sense for the theater, not the eye. I think the first theater was a story told by a storyteller, and it’s a voice, and the voice determines it, and the rhythm of the voice determines the images in some way.

It’s not only what you say, but the rhythm and speed of all the voices in a scene. That’s why often when I direct, I turn my back on a scene.”

—

This was a aha moment for me. Maybe Welles is being Welles, and he was never really turning his back when directing a scene, but I get what he means, and the essence here, even if you don’t want to take it literally, is that ‘sound editing’ when directing your actors is fundamental for a scene to reach its highest potential.

It is in the continuity of Tarantino’s technique to get useful feedback as the screenwriting stage too. Ultimately, if films are moving images, sound is this essential component, this first sense to quote Welles, that glues it all together when it follows the right rhythm.

I love that Welles talked the way you wouldn’t be able to talk today. I can’t imagine any filmmaker admitting that their artistic vision gets clouded by someone’s look over talent to tell a text during casting. But if they do, maybe finding there’s a way to make it work will help.

I know that as I start having my first serious conversations with my producer about casting for In Five Years, Welles’ admission has never felt more useful and relevant.

169,"""Hit after hit, bling-bling, an opening act, Selena giving to charity, and of course, surprises."" ",http://eonli.ne/24BSnUh,"Instagram

3. Opening Act: Fans may just want to show up right on time because Joe Jonas and his band DNCE are kicking off the party as the opening performers. Whether it's their catchy hits like ""Cake by the Ocean"" or their unforgettable outfits, the group isn't your average opener. ""LAST NIGHT WAS EPIC!"" the group shared on Instagram after night one. ""THANK U VEGAS! #revivaltour."" Bea Miller is also expected to perform before Selena takes the stage.

4. Charity: As if you needed another reason to buy your tickets. The singer has plans to donate proceeds from each ticket sold to the Alliance for Lupus Research. Back in Oct. 2015, Selena revealed to Billboard that she was diagnosed with lupus. ""I waited for the right time to talk about it because I am in a great place and I'm very healthy,"" she later explained to the publication. "" I'm not trying to be loud about it: It was time to use my platform to help.""

5. Surprises: During this tour, Selena is feeling confident and eager to switch things up when fans least expect it. ""This show is so centered around me, and I mean that in a way of confidence, of strength,"" Gomez shared with Billboard. ""It has a beautiful feel to it, but it is about me, so if I wanted to come in one day and say I want to change [a song in the show] or add this, I can do that."" She continued, ""That's the first time I've ever really been able to do that in my life. And I feel, I feel great about it. It's not me making sure I hit all the dance moves.""",2016-05-08 20:45:26

171,Rickon Stark. ,http://ti.me/1SPI3AH,"Forget that Rickon Stark was a character on Game of Thrones? Us too. Rickon has long lived on the “where the heck is that character” list along with Benjen Stark, Beric Dondarrion and Gendry. (Seriously, where is Gendry? He’s the rightful heir to the throne for goodness sake.)

But the baby of the Stark family is returning to the show, according to actress Maisie Williams.

The Game of Thrones cast is notoriously good at keeping spoilers from fans: For almost an entire year poor Kit Harington had to pretend he’d actually left the show. But during an interview with BBC Radio 1, a caller asked the actress who plays Arya whether we would be hearing from Rickon again this season. “Yes, maybe,” Williams tentatively replied. Later she clarified: “Yes, we will indeed… Oh no, I’m literally going to get off the air and someone’s going to email me!”

We last saw the youngest Stark child way back in season three when he fled a Theon-ruled Winterfell with Bran, Hodor and Osha. Bran instructed Rickon, his Wildling babysitter Osha and direwolf Shaggy Dog (yes, he really named a killer direwolf Shaggy Dog) to head for the Last Hearth, the seat of the House Umber, a family loyal to the Starks) in the North.

Now that Jon Snow is back, he’s going to need to battle the Boltons for the North. Rounding up all the Starks—he’s unlikely to reach Arya or Bran, but he may be able to find Sansa and Rickon—would not only protect them from the Boltons but would rally the families loyal to the Starks in their fight for Winterfell. As they say: The North remembers.

172,Hodor was a warg and stayed in his animal so long that he lost himself. ,http://huff.to/24AXpAk,"HBO

A new theory is sweeping the Internet, and it could even make Hodor say ""damn.""

Besides the whole Jon Snow thing on Sunday's episode of ""Game of Thrones,"" there was one other moment that was almost as shocking:

Advertisement

Hodor talked.

And by talked, we mean he said a hella lot more than ""Hodor.""

In the scene, which was one of Bran's visions into the past, we see Hodor, whose real name is apparently Willis, actually talk to Ned Stark's sister, Lyanna. Sure, he's probably not the sharpest sword in the armory, but he's savvy enough to pick up on a young Benjen Stark's fighting tendencies.

Bran was as surprised as us to discover that Hodor could talk, so how did Willis become the Hodor we know and love today?

Advertisement

Well, Redditors gbinasia and TazoGreenTea have a theory that seems so ridiculous, it actually makes sense.

The theory: Hodor was a warg and stayed in his animal so long that he lost himself.

Whoa-dor.

According to the theory, Hodor was a warg/skinchanger as a kid, but he may have spent too much time in his animal, causing him to lose a part of himself (something Jojen Reed once warned Bran about).

Advertisement

There's also the possibility that Hodor's animal was killed while he was warging into it, which is a traumatic event for a skinchanger. This could've led him to lose his mind.

But if Hodor was a warg, what animal would he change into? Gbinasia explains that the obvious choice is Lyanna's horse:

As a stable boy, it would make sense that his choice would be to warg into a horse since, like dogs, they are docile and are accustomed to his presence. And if the (possibly) only girl treating him nicely was Lyanna, it would make complete sense that this is the horse he would warg into.

From the books, we know Lyanna died at the Tower of Joy. Could Hodor, as her horse, have died there, as well? Or was he perhaps killed in some battle? Is this the real reason Hodor became ... well ... Hodor?

The evidence

1. A whole section in George R.R. Martin's books compares Hodor to a horse.

Redditor PliersD3 points out that in Martin's second book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Clash of Kings, Hodor is straight-up called a horse:

Little Walder cast his splintered lance aside, spied Bran, and reined up. “Now there’s an ugly horse,” he said of Hodor. “Hodor’s no horse,” Bran said.

“Hodor,” said Hodor.

Big Walder trotted up to join his cousin. “Well, he’s not as smart as a horse, that’s for certain.” Is this a hint into the truth about Hodor? There's more, too. Little Walder even speculates that Hodor means ""I love you"" in horse. Plus, in Martin's novel, A Game of Thrones, there's a line where Maester Luwin says, ""Hodor is a man, not a mule to be beaten.” Uh, no offense, Luwin, but this theory begs to differ, bruh.

2. Hodor has taken on the characteristics of a horse.

HBO

After Bran loses the use of his legs in the book, he's often described as riding around on Hodor's back. Also, Hodor appears to fear the dark and lightning like horses might, as revealed in this excerpt from A Storm of Swords:

Advertisement

The lightning flashed again, and this time the thunder came at six. “Hodor!” Hodor yelled again. “HODOR! HODOR!” He snatched up his sword, as if to fight the storm.

3. Wargs can lose their minds when their animals are killed.

A precedent has already been set for when a warg's animal is killed. In Martin's books, Melisandre kills an eagle that has a wildling warg in it. The wildling goes mad because of it, losing control of his other animals.

4. The three-eyed raven has been watching Hodor all along.

Redditor TazoGreenTea brings up a scene from Season 4 where the three-eyed raven tells Hodor, Bran and Meera, ""I've been watching you -- all of you -- all of your lives.""

Why would the raven be watching Hodor if there wasn't a reason to? Did Hodor once have visions like Bran did?

In the Bran flashback scene, we see Lyanna on a horse, Hodor talking and the three-eyed raven warning Bran not to stay in visions too long. It seems a little random, but if the theory is true, then it all makes sense. If Bran stays in visions or wargs for too long, he may lose himself like Hodor.

When The Huffington Post once asked George R.R. Martin about the origins of Hodor, he wouldn't reveal the answer. Could this theory be the reason why Hodor is Hodor? Or are we barking up the wrong Hodor?",2016-05-08 20:42:44
173,Captain America should have been gay. ,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/captain-america-civil-war-steve-rogers-sharon-carter-bucky-barnes,"This post contains spoilers for Captain America: Civil War. If you haven’t seen the film yet or don’t want to be spoiled on anything, now is that time to go. Spoilers ahoy after one more firm warning from Cap.

If you’re not deep into internet culture, you may be unaware of the intensely devoted section of the Captain America fan base who consider Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), not Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), to be the true object of Steve Rogers’ (Chris Evans) affection. Oh but they’re out there. Just search Bucky/Steve and you’ll see what I mean. But make sure you have the safe search mode switched on first.

When Captain America: Civil War directors Joe and Anthony Russo went on a publicity tour for the latest installment in Marvel’s Avengers franchise, they were very careful not to throw cold water on the popular fan theory that Steve “Captian America” Rogers and Bucky “The Winter Soldier” Barnes were more than friends. “People can interpret the relationship however they want to interpret it,” Joe Russo said while visiting China. “People have interpreted that relationship all kinds of ways, and it’s great to see people argue about it what that relationship means to them. We will never define it as filmmakers, explicitly, but however people want to interpret it they can interpret it.”

Even Evans and Stan seemed happy to throw fuel on the Bucky/Steve theories during the publicity tour.

But despite what Joe Russo said, doesn’t Captain America: Civil War go out of its way to “define” Bucky and Steve’s relationship when Cap smooches Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) while Bucky looks on approvingly? Where’s the room for interpretation in that moment? And, leaving aside the vague creepiness of Steve making a move on Peggy’s (very willing) niece, the moment itself wasn’t necessary to the flow of the movie at all.

As was the case in Captain America: Winter Soldier, VanCamp is a hugely appealing (if slightly underused) member of the cast. The film even gave her one of Captain’s most iconic comic book speeches when Sharon and Steve are mulling over how to move forward in the shadow of Peggy’s death. It’s a great moment for her and for the story. And while I think Agent Peggy Carter would have encouraged Agent Sharon Carter to join in the big fight on the tarmac, in general Sharon’s insider access to the government served the story very well.",2016-05-08 20:42:15

This week's playlist update includes Drop Zone mode, which first debuted in 2011's CoD: Modern Warfare 3.

The team-based mode challenges players to hold objectives to win, with teams earning points by staying inside the designated...drop zone. The first team to reach the goal point total wins the match. The hook with Drop Zone is that killstreaks continually fall from the sky while you're holding the zone, which leads to some particularly turbulent gameplay.

A blog post by Activision offers a number of tips, tricks, and strategies for succeeding in Drop Zone, which is played across a variety of maps such as Crash, Arklov Peak, and Granza Raid.

Drop Zone originated in Modern Warfare 3, and it was subsequently featured in other Infinity Ward-developed titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. The mode will come to Modern Warfare at some point this week across PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

It's a big week for Call of Duty, as Warzone introduces a new way to play, while Infinity Ward will offer double XP for the weekend. Modern Warfare's Season 3 is currently underway, and you can check out the new maps in a dedicated playlist right now.",2020-04-15 05:56:06
177,Nepal. ,https://www.gamebyte.com/pubg-has-been-completely-banned-in-one-country/,"PUBG has been banned across the country and others look ready to follow suit.

Banned games come around every so often. Whether banned for their violence, their imagery or for their politics, it’s unfortunately a pretty common occurrence to see a country completely ban a game.

What’s not common is to see it happen to a game that’s as popular as PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, but it seems the battle royale has been banned in the country of Nepal.

Internet service providers were issued a warning from Nepal’s telecommunication authority earlier this week, and were told to block PUBG.

The instructions came from the Kathmandu district court.

Senior police official, Dhiraj Pratap Singh, told AFP [via Daily Mail]: “We sought an order from the court to ban PUBG after floods of complaints from parents, guardians and school organisations to block the game citing psychological impact on teenagers and students.”

The news comes following the death of a 16-year-old in India, who died by suicide after being told by his parents to stop playing PUBG in favour of his studies.

It’s not the first time that PUBG has been blamed for such heartbreaking news in India. Earlier this year, two men in their 20s lost their lives when absorbed in the mobile version of PUBG too close to railway tracks.

Some parts of India (more specifically, a number of cities in the state of Gujarat) have already banned PUBG after concerns of it encouraging violent behaviour and distractions from schooling.

Two dozen young people have since been arrested for violating the ban and playing the game.

In Nepal, anyone caught playing the game will now also face arrest, though the country has come under some criticism for banning the title instead of encouraging restricted play time or gaming addiction awareness.

What do you think about the ban? Will India be the next country to outlaw PUBG?

The first offering from Sony is Conan Exiles, which Sony describes with the following:

“Drawing inspiration from the classic barbarian tales, survival open world survival game Conan Exiles winds back the clock to the very dawn of civilization, casting you as a forgotten exile abandoned alone in the desert for crimes unknown.

“Starting out with nothing but a loincloth and your own two hands, you’ll have to explore this vast, hostile world, gathering materials, crafting tools and carving out a new life for yourself in a world filled with danger.

“Exploring a shared online space, you’ll have the chance to meet with other players, build settlements and bases together, and even raise your own armed fortresses as you advance your mission to dominate this brave new world.”

Your second freebie for April is popular RPG, The Surge, which comes from the creators of “brutal medieval action-adventure Lords of the Fallen,” and is described as “a challenging sci-fi spin on the hardcore RPG genre.”

It’s not been long since Sony decided to cut the cord with its PlayStation 3 and PS Vita monthly freebies, leaving us with just two free titles each month. Sob.

Sure, some would argue that it didn't live up to everyone's high expectations and the combat was a bit too easy, but as a conclusion to the Xehanort saga, it was well done. As we wait for the inevitable Kingdom Hearts 4, fans are still asking one question.

Where were the Final Fantasy characters?

Yeah, despite the game's foundation being built upon a crossover between Disney and Final Fantasy, we didn't get any characters from that legendary series, outside of the Moogles. Sure, there were Dissidia NT Toys, a giant Cactuar, and statues of Cloud and Auron, but no characters from the series appeared properly.

Kingdom Hearts 3 Ultimania, the official companion book for the most recent Kingdom Hearts game, includes a special interview with director Tetsuya Nomura. Translated by Twitter user @lunesacree via KH13 , Nomura reveals why properties from Marvel and Lucasfilm weren't included in the game, and it mostly boils down to contract complications - the same reason why Mickey Mouse was barely in the first Kingdom Hearts “In order to change those [properties] into a game, contracts must be made with each company separately, and there are cases where other game companies already have contracts, so although the Disney Group has indeed added those [properties], incorporating them into Kingdom Hearts isn't so simple,” said Nomura.""That’s also the reason Mickey is in only one scene in Kingdom Hearts 1,” he continued. ""At the same time, another company was releasing a game that had to do with Mickey, so though we were denied his usage, we persisted and eventually got 'as long as you only have one scene, from far away, as a silhouette, with him waving his hand or something.' Since we had to make the best of the biggest [and only] chance we had, that's why that scene appears that way.""Though we really wanted to see Star Wars and Marvel in Kingdom Hearts 3’s DLC , these comments make it seem less than likely - though certainly still possible. Nomura previously confirmed that both free and paid DLC is in the works for Kingdom Hearts 3.

182,They believe that it is outdated. #StopClickbait,https://www.gamebyte.com/sony-admits-why-it-wont-be-appearing-at-e3-this-year/,"Sony said last year it won't be presenting at E3, and now we know why.

Sony shocked gamers when it announced last year that it wouldn’t be making an appearance at E3 2019. It’s the first time in E3’s 24-year-long history that Sony has decided not to present, and considering how close we are to the launch of next-generation consoles, it was a move that raised a lot of eyebrows in the community.

It seems like we’ve now gotten some clarity on the matter though, as Sony’s SIE Worldwide Chairman Shawn Layden opened up to CNET [via Destructoid].

Layden explained: “The world has changed, but E3 hasn’t necessarily changed with it,” referencing the way that E3 was set-up at a time before the internet.

When E3 was in its infancy, people got their gaming news from magazines rather the internet, and with instantly-available news via social media, it makes sense to say E3 is a little…old school.

Instead of E3, Layden said Sony will be doing things a little differently with Destination PlayStation.

He said: “We have an event in February called Destination PlayStation, where we bring all retailers and third-party partners to come hear the story for the year.

“They’re making purchasing discussions in February. June, now, is just too late to have a Christmas holiday discussion with retailers. So retail has really dropped off. And journalists now, with the internet and the fact that 24/7 there is game news, it’s [E3] lost its impact around that…

“With our decision to do fewer games — bigger games — over longer periods of time we got to a point where June of 2019 was not a time for us to have a new thing to say.”

So…does this mean Sony’s highly-anticipated exclusive titles, Death Stranding and The Last Of Us 2 won’t be here until 2020…?

Only time will tell!

That’s what I don’t get. In one sentence he says that E3 has lost its relevancy, then he says they aren’t pulling out of E3 forever. It’s almost like he’s being a petulant child about the fact Sony won’t be there this year and having a sly dig at the E3 and others that will be. — Reidzer N7 (@ReidzerN7) February 12, 2019

183,Erdrick from the Dragon Quest series. #StopClickbait,https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/12/16/super-smash-bros-ultimate-second-dlc-character-leaked-dragon-quest/,"For quite some time now, we've gotten our fair share of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate rumors revolving around the downloadable fighters coming to the hit game. We already know that Joker from Persona 5 is confirmed thanks to a recent trailer from the Game Awards, but the rest of the roster are still shrouded in mystery. Some of these rumors have suggested that particular favorites, from Banjo Kazooie to the Rhythm Heaven choir kids to Waluigi, are coming to the game. Nothing confirmed yet, however.

Now you can add one more to the list. A new leak has suggested that the second downloadable fighter for Ultimate is coming out of left field- a character from the Dragon Quest series.

The info comes from Persona Central (originally translated from 5Channel), which suggests that Erdrick, a long-time favorite in Square Enix's role-playing series, will be joining the party. The information is translated as follows:

Erdrick

Stage is Alefgard

Erdrick (Male) and Erdrick (Female), 2 colors each of Anlucia and the Dragon Quest XI Hero

Slime appears on screen with a skill

Achieved through active collaboration on Square's side

To the benefit of overseas marketing for the DQ series

The following image was also found, possibly cementing the idea that both male and female versions of Erdrick would be included within the game:

But, on top of that, the site has also reportedly found further information about Joker, including his themed stage in Ultimate, as well as the appearance of another character.

Joker

The stage is Mementos

Jack Frost appears on screen with a skill

Game director Masahiro Sakurai did make it clear that Ultimate's DLC roster would surprise fans, and Erdrick definitely falls into this category. And the worldwide appeal of Dragon Quest would make it fairly easy to crossover a character from that universe into this fighting universe.

That aside, do take this rumor with a grain of salt. 5Channel isn't exactly the most common news source out there; and while the details and image look to be fairly accurate, we've seen rumors such as this before where proposed leaks turned out to be unsubstantiated. At least, for now.

Would you like to see a character from Dragon Quest join the Super Smash Bros. universe? Or would you prefer someone from another Square Enix franchise? Lara Croft from Tomb Raider, perhaps?

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is available now for Nintendo Switch in both physical and digital form via eShop.

From 24th January – 7th February you can download, play and keep the first JackBox Party Pack, just by signing up to the site. Thanks, Epic Games!

You won’t need to worry about playing with friends, as they’ll use their smartphones to access your game as you and your buddies compete for the win.

Last call! We’ve partnered with Giant Sparrow and Annapurna Interactive to offer ‘What Remains of Edith Finch’ for free on PC inside the Epic Games store until 11:59PM EST on January 24, 2019.

If you still want Edith Finch, today is the last day you can grab it, so you’ll have to act fast!

The Epic Store is working hard to not just provide incentives for players, but for developers too.

The new-ish digital PC store hopes to pull game devs away from Steam by giving them 88% of the revenues, keeping just 12% for itself.

Right now, Steam usually takes around 30% of revenue from devs, meaning Epic Games would be seriously undercutting them with a move like this. With such potential savings for game developers, it’s easy to see why they’d want to publish their game on an Epic store page.

The first member of the Overwatch cast to be confirmed as part of the LGBT community was of course Tracer. Now we know that a male character is actually gay. Soldier 76, also known as Jack Morrison, has been confirmed as a gay character.

The healing sniper from the game, Ana, finds a wounded Soldier 76 in the Cairo streets. She then takes him back to her hideout and speaks to him (as well as looked after him I assume). She then sees Soldier 76 going through a stack of old photos and one in particular catches her eye. The one that she spotted was an old one of Soldier 76 with a dark-haired man named Vincent. Here is what happens in the short:

“Vincent… I haven’t thought about him in years,” Ana said. “Still keeping a candle lit for him?”

Jack shook his head. “Nothing like that.”

“You’ve never looked in on him? You must have been curious. All the surveillance power in the world. I bet Gabe would have put a Blackwatch agent on him if you asked,” Ana said.

Jack glared at her.

“Okay, touchy subject.”

Jack laughed. “He got married. They’re very happy. I’m happy for him.” “Vincent deserved a happier life than the one I could give him.” Jack sighed. “We both knew that I could never put anything above my duty. Everything I fought for was to protect people like him… That’s the sacrifice I made.”

“Relationships don’t work out so well for us, do they?” Ana said, unconsciously running her thumb over where her wedding ring used to be.

But why did livestreaming get so popular? For the big dogs like Ninja, the format has earned them millions and millions of dollars, and streams are the perfect place to talk to like-minded fans of games that you yourself enjoy.

One Twitch streamer believes that’s exactly why people enjoy livestreams – because they can go and talk about games.

In a recent stream, Twitch user A_Seagull said to his fans that he believes there just isn’t a place for people to talk about games anymore.

Using the example of Overwatch, he says: “People don’t talk about the game anymore. I watch a lot of stuff. There are probably less than 10 Overwatch YouTubers.

“The only place for discussions in most games is 1) Reddit 2) YouTube 3) Twitch…turns out most of the Twitch streamers are already quitting…

“Who actually talks about the game anymore?”

It might not be a valid point for all games, as Reddit forums such as the r/Reddeadredemption forum have been blowing up since the game’s release – but in a few months, it’s likely that will see a significant drop in conversation.

Kotaku reports that the Sony Interactive Entertainment’s aftercare service for the PlayStation 2 in Japan is coming to an end.

Looking back at all the good times we had, it’s hard not to feel a little emotional at the fact that it’s all over. Grand Theft Auto radio stations shaped many of our music tastes as we grew older. How many of us would have known all the words to Depeche Mode – Personal Jesus by the time we were 10 if not for the PS2?

The company has put out communication to PS2 owners, asking them to fill out online forms to have their machine serviced one last time. The cut-off date? August 31.

On top of that what inspired the other design choices for the gamepad?

To find this out, we have to jump back to 1983 and look at Nintendo. After finding success in the arcade and digital toy side of gaming, with the likes of Donkey Kong and their Game and Watch handhelds, they decided to enter the home console market. They used inspiration from some of their Game and Watch digital toys for their control pad. The name of that home console? The Nintendo Entertainment System.

The simple gamepad of the NES helped set it apart from the competition. A four-way directional pad on the left, two buttons on the right, and start and select buttons in the middle. It was easy for anyone to pick up and understand. Something proven by a four-year-old me and my 60-year-old grandma on numerous occasions.

The NES controller set a new standard for the games industry, and as new systems were introduced from competitors the D-Pad quickly became a mainstay, with the face buttons varying in letters and numbers. Nintendo then introduced the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and evolved the gamepad again, in a way that still sees its influence to this very day. Two more buttons were added on the right, and two buttons were added to each shoulder at the top of the controller.

The time of the Super Nintendo was also the time of a collaboration between Nintendo and an electronics company you might have heard of – Sony.

Sony was working with them to make a CD-ROM accessory that would be compatible with the SNES, and began work on it all the way back in 1988 – two years before the SNES even existed. At the Consumer Electronics Shows in June 1991, Sony announced the collaboration to the world. At the show the very next day, Nintendo announced their partnership with Philips to make a CD-ROM accessory. A surprise to everyone… especially Sony.

This created an obvious conflict between Sony and Nintendo and spurred Sony on to make their own console, the PlayStation, which would release in 1994. The story of Sony and Nintendo’s conflict is something for another day, but an important thing to establish, as we explore why they adopted the shapes of triangle, circle, X and square.

In Super Mario World, an enemy called a Magikoopa, or Kamek (depending where you’re from), tries to attack you by firing some magic. How does that magic appear on screen? In the shape of a triangle, circle and square, with what looks suspiciously like an X as well.

Some believe this why Sony chose the shapes they did, but unfortunately that’s not the case – they have some very specific reasons for their shapes and colours.

How do we know this? From a 2010 interview with Sony engineer Teiyu Goto. Teiyu designed the PlayStation controllers and, whilst being interviewed in 2010, explained that the shapes and their colours were not just random, but something deeply thought out. He said:

Other game companies at the time assigned alphabet letters or colours to the buttons. We wanted something simple to remember, which is why we went with icons or symbols, and I came up with the triangle-circle-X-square combination immediately afterward. I gave each symbol a meaning and a colour. The triangle refers to viewpoint; I had it represent one’s head or direction and made it green. Square refers to a piece of paper; I had it represent menus or documents and made it pink. The circle and X represent ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision-making and I made them red and blue respectively. People thought those colours were mixed up, and I had to reinforce to management that that’s what I wanted.

The controller has evolved over the years to include thumbsticks, vibration, and more, but the shapes and a lot of the layout has stayed the same, making them a key part of PlayStation’s brand identity and much more than a bunch of random shapes.",2018-08-17 05:20:29
193,Climbing towers to reveal areas and points of interest. Such a long article 🙄 it’s an alright read if you want to know a detailed description of the first 2 hours of Spider-Man. ,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-ps4s-first-few-hours-have-everything-we/1100-6460894/?ftag=GSS-05-10aab8d&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_content=5b6e03dd9ac5640001976654&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook,"If you love reading superhero comic books, there's a good chance that a huge part of what makes them so attractive is the way they explore the regular lives of the people behind the masks. Matt Murdoch's daily courtroom drama and neighborhood philanthropy, Jessica Drew's demanding commitments as a single mother, and the multifaceted teenage dramas of Kamala Khan and other student-aged heroes are equally as engrossing as the crime-fighting adventures of their alter-egos. And when work and life clash, that's when things really get interesting.

The more mundane side of superhero stories are rarely explored in video game adaptations, and that's something Insomniac Games is openly talking about as a major point of difference in their take on Marvel's Spider-Man. In the game's first two hours, which I experienced during a recent preview tour, a large chunk of time was spent controlling Peter Parker in his mild-mannered form, as well as Mary Jane Watson. Insomniac explained that this ratio was largely indicative of the rest of the game, with major themes of mentorship and trust as something that would be explored with and without masks.

That might sound like a far cry from what's been shown of Insomniac's Spider-Man up to this point, but these moments hit all the right notes for us. The game's version of Peter Parker falls on the dweeby side, despite being old and having almost a decade of crime-fighting expertise. He's messy, perpetually behind on his bills, and isn't currently in any kind of romantic relationship, all thanks to his second life. But he takes time to visit his Aunt May and catch up with acquaintances, as well as work on science projects as part of his day job, hoping he can do some good there, too.

I spent a large part of Spider-Man's opening hours exploring interior environments as Peter, making and listening in on small talk, looking at photos and reading documents to fill out back-story, and performing research experiments--there are Pipe Dream and pattern matching minigames that can earn you experience points to spend on Spidey abilities. Mary Jane, an investigative reporter in this universe, has her own separate narrative motivations that quickly become entwined in the rest of the plot. Her interactive segments have their own mechanics, which Insomniac told us would grow and evolve over the course of the game. For more on Mary Jane's section in these opening hours, be sure to read Kallie's in-depth account.

But as happy as I was to see a big emphasis on the Peter and MJ side of things, I still had just one thing on my mind, being this was my very first first hands-on: Whether or not Insomniac's Spider-Man was going to surpass the memories I had playing Treyarch's open-world Spider-Man 2 for consoles, generally regarded as the best Spider-Man game to date, thanks to its phenomenal web-swinging mechanics. And it most definitely does, as we've previously reported. Insomniac's Spider-Man adheres strictly to the rule that Spidey's web lines need to attach to a structure, and that creates the wonderful sense of tangibility that is both essential to selling the experience, as well as creating a satisfying need for forethought when traversing New York City.

It works like this: R2 shoots out a web line, and pressing X while mid-swing will let you jump and gain height or distance, depending on where you are in your arc. Pressing X without being attached to a web line will let you perform a quick web zip, which propels you forward, allowing you to gain directional momentum without losing height, and is great for quickly changing directions. Finally, holding L2 will trigger a slowdown, allowing you to aim a cursor and hit R2 to create a direct zipline to that particular point (provided it's in range), and is a great landing technique that allows you to expertly perch on lampposts and other locations, just like a spider can.

Web swinging feels fantastic, and minor additions, such as hitting L3 to nosedive, using Circle + Triangle in tandem with the left stick to perform aerial tricks for experience points, and the motion blur when you pick up a large amount of speed, adds a lot to making the act of getting around town a pure joy. Even Central Park can be traversed by web-swinging, thankfully, so long as you pick a route with enough trees to latch onto.

Movement on the ground also feels suitably Spider-Man-like. Aside from using L2 and R2 to web zip from point to point, holding R2 acts as an Assassin's Creed-like parkour button, allowing you to easily clear obstacles, as well as run up and across the side of buildings. But if you need a break from thinking about how to get from A to B, Spidey can also just take the subway and fast travel to a different station.

The parkour button isn't the only inspiration Insomniac's Spider-Man takes from an Ubisoft series, though. In a move that took me completely by surprise, Spider-Man incorporates the archaic mechanic of tower reveals, that is, points of interest that you have to find, travel to, and solve a puzzle at in order to reveal a map of the immediate area, as well as the locations of other points of interests like side missions, challenges, collectables, and Far Cry-style outposts. Each district of Manhattan represented in the game--Chinatown, Greenwich, Financial District, Hell's Kitchen, Midtown, Upper West Side, Central Park, Upper East Side, and Harlem--has a number of towers hidden within them, which you're required to activate before you're even able to see where you're going on your minimap.

This is strange not only because the mechanic feels incredibly outdated--Ubisoft has moved on, their open-world franchises now focus on more organic discovery mechanics--but it just doesn't make characteristic sense. Insomniac has been pitching their version of Spider-Man as an experienced one, one that's been fighting crime in New York for nearly a decade, and it's incredibly puzzling that this Spider-Man hasn't internalized an intimate geographic knowledge of the city he protects. I don't believe him when he exclaims, ""I'm flying blind here!"" while swinging through world-famous Times Square, no matter what the tower MacGuffin might be.

Any activity revealed by towers can still be found by naturally stumbling across them, and minor Spider-Man 2-style randomly-generated events, such as car crashes and armed robberies, also can pop up unannounced, which is great to see. But the emphasis on using towers to reveal them just seems like a huge misstep, a puzzling addition that feels like unnecessary filler.

But there's still plenty of good filler in there, namely, the number of things you can stuff into Spider-Man's suit. As expected, you can unlock dozens of different Spider-Man costumes by earning experience and leveling up to gain access, and spending different tokens (earned through completing side content) to purchase them for use. Each suit comes with its own unique suit ability to assist you during the game's exciting, Batman Arkham-inspired combat system, but a nice feature is that once you own a suit, you can transfer its unique ability to a different suit you own.

For example, I immediately sought to don the Spider-Man Noir costume, which comes with the ability to stop enemies from calling backup (great for stealth approaches), but swapped that out for the Battle Focus ability from the Advanced Suit seen in the game's marketing materials. Battle Focus steadily increases your Focus meter, used in combat to heal and perform the game's cinematic takedowns. Other suits and abilities I saw included the Classic Suit (webs every enemy in sight), Scarlet Spider (creates holographic decoys), and the Spider Armor MK II (protects from bullet fire).

True to Peter's science background, you can also equip a number of unique combat gadgets, switching between them using a radial menu with L1, and upgrade their effectiveness over the course of the game. Aside from the standard web shooters, they include things like impact webbing to pin enemies to surfaces, spider drones that seek out opponents and fire energy, electric webs that stun, web bombs that are proximity triggered, web trip mines, concussive blasts, and a suspension matrix that suspends enemies in the air.

The game also has a skill tree for ability progression, featuring three branches with which to upgrade Spidey's combat and web swinging techniques. The Innovator branch focuses on web-based combat techniques, such as using webs to disarm gun-toting thugs and the ability to throw a larger variety of objects and enemies, while the Defender branch improves Spider-Man's general striking, evasion, and combo abilities, letting you earn bonuses for things like perfectly-timed dodges. Finally, the Webslinger branch largely lets you perform additional traversal moves, but also gives you access to Spidey's infamous web swing kick in combat. It also unlocks the aforementioned ability to perform tricks in mid-air for small amounts of XP and large amounts of style.

There are a number of references too, of course, found in dialogue, environment, and the game's backpack collectibles. But it's a range that can be appreciated by both casual Spider-Man fans (Spidey asking ""Should we kiss?"" to a hanging enemy), and fanatics (a mention of ""Nazis made of bees""). There were some nice interactive touches I loved: using the attack buttons around citizens lets you wave and give high fives, with some interactions giving you XP, and J.J. Jameson now hosts a podcast Peter listens to, but you can unsubscribe in the audio settings menu.

Insomniac's representation of the Spider-Man experience plays as good as it looks, at least in its opening hours. The web swinging and acrobatic combat are instantly satisfying, but it's also wonderful to see that there's a lot more to it--a significant focus on interacting as Peter Parker and Mary Jane (which we're hoping will continue to evolve into something great), a depth of progression options and combat abilities, and many minor, but exciting details that positively colored my short experience. The opening hours had me eager to play more--even just to have more time swinging around the city--but it also reinvigorated my excitement about the Marvel universe in general. I just wish I could forget about those towers.",2018-08-10 15:45:44

Speaking of Fortnite, dataminers have uncovered yet more information from the game’s latest patch.

There’s a tonne of new stuff coming to Fortnite (and really, when isn’t there?) including new game modes, cosmetic upgrades and weapons.

The latest rumours suggest we might be seeing two new sniper rifles enter play, along with new game modes which hopefully are going to keep the game as strong as ever.

The game’s developer, Epic Games, has been getting some flack recently after issues with bugs and items having to be pulled from the game came to light.

Playground Mode, shotguns, health items and more have all caused problems within the Fortnite community, so it’s a good thing Epic Games are pretty on the ball when it comes to patches and bug-fixes.

Fortnite is one of the biggest games in the world right now, with the free-to-play game’s Battle Royale mode taking the universe by storm.

Although not without its controversy, fans still can’t get enough of Fortnite. With so many regular updates from Epic Games, it’s hard to imagine this game is going anywhere anytime soon.

What are you most looking forward to seeing added into the game? Have you encountered any weird glitches in your games?",2018-08-08 14:00:42
195,"No dates announced. Everyone knows it’s gonna be free to play eventually, everything in this article is just speculation. ",https://www.gamebyte.com/fortnites-save-the-world-will-soon-be-free-for-everyone/,"Fortnite has just turned one year old, celebrating its birthday in style with a party Battle Bus, new challenges and cosmetic goodies which will soon be leaving until (presumably) the game’s second bday.

It’s difficult to remember a time before we’d all experienced the absolute joy of the free-to-play Battle Royale mode which rocketed the game to success.

But despite Fortnite being known as a “free” game, there are still some aspects of it that will expect you to cough up the cash – Save The World, for example.

Epic Games has previous told its many, many fans that Save The World will soon be at the same cost-free status as its Battle Royale mode, but all we knew was that it was a change planned for sometime this year.

Speaking to the Express, Fortnite’s Lead Systems Designer, Eric Williamson commented: “We’re still looking at a 2018 free release for ‘Save the World.’ Epic tried to be really generous with the content in Early Access packs, and there have been events and items that exclusive to this Early Access period already!

“We appreciate everyone who’s played and supported the game so far, and our philosophy is to do everything we can to show that to our players.”

We haven’t heard too much about the potentially free content since Williamson made this statement a few months ago, but as we’re nearly through with 2018, we can imagine we’ll be getting an update on the release sooner rather than later.

There was initially a lot of speculation suggesting that the launch of Season Five of the game could introduce the first cost-free Save The World mode, but that’s yet to happen.

Maybe next season, then?

While we wait there’s still a load of content coming to the game, including new skins, weapons and even a few new modes too.

That should be plenty to tide you over until Save The World is free, right?

Have you played Save The World, and how do you think it compares to Battle Royale?",2018-08-08 10:35:38
196,"Scarlet. The name is Scarlet. 

(Also, GameByte is trying to get back into clickbait, so, we might have more posting :D )",https://www.gamebyte.com/next-xbox-launching-in-2020-and-its-codename-has-people-talking/,"Gamers believe the successor to the Xbox One could be coming in 2020, and its development name is very unique.

Microsoft confirmed back at E3 this year that work has already begun on the new consoles from Xbox, and the fact that multiple versions of the console are coming has gotten fans very excited.

Now it looks like we’ve got a bit more info on the upcoming console launch, as multiple sources are claiming the consoles are being developed under the codename ‘Scarlett.’

Of course, it’s common practise for consoles to be developed with a name that eventually has nothing to do with the final product, but this hasn’t stopped fans from speculating what the name could mean.

According to reports on other consoles, past codenames have ranged from the sensible to the downright weird, meaning ‘Scarlett’ could just be a Microsoft in-joke, a reference to a game or even just a randomly selected name.

The Wii U was developed under the name ‘Project Café,’ the PlayStation was named ‘Orbis’ and the Xbox One went by ‘Durango.’

In some other exciting news, a report from Thurrott is claiming that ‘Scarlett’ will be launching in 2020.

Writing for Thurrott, Brad Sams says: “This past week, I was tipped off that the next generation Xbox was codenamed Scarlett and in an effort to track down if this information was accurate, I was able to view content that highlighted several unannounced Microsoft products that are coming in the next two years.

“Microsoft is planning for the next Xbox console release to arrive in 2020. But what is more interesting, is that Microsoft describes ‘Scarlett’ as a family of devices; meaning we may see multiple pieces of hardware released that year.

“That date may seem relatively close considering that the Xbox One X launched last year but Microsoft is aggressively moving ahead with hardware in the console space to shake up the industry. But what we don’t know is if this is a brand new set of devices or simply a more ‘powerful’ Xbox One that is again, fully backward compatible with all the content available today.”

Sounds exciting!",2018-07-19 14:04:14
197,"In his celebration Khabib’s character does the Christian sign of the cross, but Khabib is actually Muslim.

As you can see from this clip, Khabib’s celebration is the Christian sign of the cross…

There’s one slight problem with that, as Khabib is actually Muslim.

He Tweeted: “I’m a MUSLIM and not Baptized. Please @EASPORTSUFC edit my after fight celebration. I have a lot of Muslim fans and you have to respect it.”

EA Sports isn’t the only one in trouble as Bethesda is suing Warner Bros after the latter released a new game that ‘clones’ their Fallout Shelter game, and even uses the same code.

Polygon reports that a suit was filed in a Maryland U.S. District Court. Bethesda alleges that Westworld, developed by Behaviour and released this week for Android and iOS, “has the same or highly similar game design, art style, animations, features and other gameplay elements” as their game.

They continued: “Behaviour breached its contract with Bethesda and utilised its restricted access to Bethesda’s intellectual property, including Bethesda’s copyrighted code, trade secrets, and other rights, to compress its development timeline, reduce costs, and quickly bring the Westworld mobile game to market, and offer players the widely popular gameplay experience found in Fallout Shelter.”

They also reckon that Behaviour used the “same copyrighted computer code” as their own game.

They also added that it “has the same or highly similar game design, art style, animations, features and other gameplay elements”

They’re right to be upset, and the situation raises a big question that it seems like no one wants to answer: Why didn’t anyone warn us not to play Fortnite on the PlayStation 4?

The issue is a problem moving in the other direction as well; if you play Fortnite on the Switch, you will not be able to access your account through the PlayStation 4. But very few players have bumped into that issue, as the Switch version of the game was only released earlier today.

The error message that Fortnite gives you when trying to play the game on the Switch after playing on the PlayStation 4 is rather icy, and sounds like Epic Games knew of the issue and wanted to make damn sure you understood that it wasn’t their fault.

“This Fortnite account is associated with a platform which does not allow it to operate on Switch,” the error message states. “Neither the Fortnite website nor Epic Customer Service are able to change this. To play Fortnite on Switch, please create a new account.”

Sony hasn’t gotten back to us. Epic Games gave us a “no comment,” even as the number of angry tweets about this situation pile up. Nintendo also declined to comment on the situation.

Epic Games itself provides a detailed FAQ about cross-platform play which indicates that the Switch and PlayStation 4 versions of the game won’t be able to interact, but nowhere does it say that playing the PlayStation 4 version at all means you can’t use your main account or any of the items you’ve purchased on the Nintendo Switch.

How the hell is this going on for so long without anyone explaining what’s going on? And if any of these companies knew this was going to happen, why were we never warned not to play the game on the PlayStation 4?

This whole thing is bad news for Sony. Despite no official statements about whose decision this was or who is responsible, a quick look around social media indicates that everyone blames Sony for the issue.

It’s not an unreasonable assumption, even if it’s based on speculation. We know Sony has kept companies from offering cross-platform play in the past. We know that Epic Games has made Xbox to PlayStation 4 cross-platform play available on Fortnite in the past. We know that Xbox’s social media team is having a good time dunking on Sony today. Whatever is actually going on, this makes Sony look like a spoiled child.

If Sony isn’t to blame for this situation, an explanation of that fact is hours overdue.

201,Simply a list of obvious things.,https://www.gamebyte.com/worst-mistakes-everybody-makes-fortnite/,"Fortnite is a great game but some of us can't seem to quite get that elusive victory royale. We are here to help.

We all love to play Fortnite at the moment. The whole world can’t seem to get enough of the 100 man battle royale game. Many of those people, including you reading this, suck. But don’t worry we got you covered. Here is our list of how to improve at Fortnite BR.

Heading Straight to a Big City

The majority of Fortnite players tend to be extra greedy and jump out of the Battle Bus right above the biggest city they see on the map, but this is not such a great idea. In the first few minutes of the game you’ll probably not have enough weapons and ammunition to be able to get into fights with other people and this is why you should avoid heading straight towards a big city; and, instead settle for a more innocuous settlement that is partially deserted so that you can loot the houses at your own pace and without the fear that you’ll get shot at by enemies.

Overlooking Building Materials

We know that Fortnite is the kind of game where you’ll want go in all guns blazing but the end game is usually won by working with a plan in mind, and building structures is the best thing you could do to achieve success. Having a variety of good weapons and plenty of ammo are two very important objectives but building materials will prove to be vital during the stormy nights so you’ll always have to be careful and gather enough household resources if you want to be able to survive in the long run. All in all, in Fortnite, guns are great, but bricks and wood planks will also prove to be very handy in a pinch.



Using the Wrong Weapon

The assault rifle is the best all-around weapon in the entire game and even though you might get so attached to it that you practically glue it to your palms, it would be wise to take the other options that are in your inventory into consideration. For example, a pumpkin launcher, a shotgun and even some explosives will prove to be perfectly viable alternatives that will help you in situations when an assault rifle would probably fail. And here is yet another piece of advice: rapidly switching between weaponry is your definite lifesaving move in Fortnite, so by all means, practice until you become the best gunslinger in the game.

Forgetting to Build

The main advantage you have in Fortnite is that you can build your very own shield wherever you are, so when you get yourself surrounded by enemies and there is no way out, think outside of the box and put together a small shelter that you can get cover in. Forgetting to build useful structures is definitely one of the worst mistakes you could commit while playing this game and if you’re going to watch let’s plays done by well-prepared players you’ll see that they tend to put together buildings more often than they shoot.



Underestimating Sound

When you’re playing fast paced survival games, listening to environmental sounds is vital because in this way you can predict the direction an enemy is approaching from, or you can hear if there is a battle close to you. Thankfully, Fortnite has a very unique sound selection that is not only very easily recognizable but also loud and clear enough to give you all the necessary hints when it comes to engaging into combat with more than just the sense of sight. In conclusion, underestimating sound can turn out to be one of those apparently innocent mistakes that are in fact crucial to the outcome of your gameplay.

Not Sorting Your Inventory

There’s nothing worse than a messy inventory where weapons mix up with building materials, aiding kits and miscellaneous loot and we are not saying this because we are some kind of superior beings who are always tidy, however, in a game like Fortnite, when you need to switch between guns in a matter of seconds, you’ll surely want to not be pointing a piece of wood towards the enemy by mistake. All in all, keeping a clear head as well as a clean inventory are two of the easiest ways of avoiding small yet fatal mistakes that could get you killed.

Hope this has helped you!",2018-02-21 10:18:31
202,Dead Space.,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-next-free-pc-game-now-available-and-its-a-good/1100-6456765/,"Dead Space, the acclaimed 2008 sci-fi horror game from the now-defunct developer Visceral Games, is now completely free on PC. It is the newest ""On the House"" game from publisher Electronic Arts, and you can grab it right here from Origin.

As with the previous On the House titles, once you download Dead Space it is yours to keep forever. The only catch is that EA doesn't say when On the House titles cycle out, so if you're interested, you may want to grab the game right now instead of putting it off until later.

Dead Space was already in the Origin Access free game library on PC, so if you subscribe to that service you have been able to play the game at no cost for a while now. The game was also released on Xbox 360, and it is playable on Xbox One through backwards compatibility. The Xbox 360 edition is in the Xbox One EA Access library.

Dead Space was in fact the very first EA On the House freebie, kicking off the freebie campaign back in 2014. It appears to be the first title to have two runs in the On the House hopper.

In Dead Space, you play as a space engineer named Isaac Clarke who must fight all manner of ghastly creatures on a spaceship.

203,"The Viking era. ""Assassin's Creed: Ragnarok"".",https://www.gamebyte.com/next-assassins-creed-could-be-set/,"The Assassins Creed franchise has been all around the world in many different settings. Here is where the franchise could be going next.

New concept art has been released for what might be the next Assassin’s Creed game and it has us wondering where the next Assassin’s Creed could be set.

Where will the next Assassin’s Creed be set?

Let’s look into where the next game could be set within the Assassin’s Creed franchise and see what kind of gameplay content could come from it.

It’s important to remember that the information in this post is so based on speculation and rumors so far, but with newly released concept art, it’s possible that these rumors could come true. If they are true, we could have a very exciting new Assassin’s Creed game on our hands.

Will The Next Assassin’s Creed Be Based On Vikings?

If recent concept art is anything to go by, the next game will be based on the Viking era. The next game has been rumoured to be called Assassin’s Creed: Ragnarok.

With the Viking era potential in mind, there are a lot of questions we have to ask about what gameplay mechanics the new game will have. I’ve tried to find answers to some of these questions below.

The Next Assassin’s Creed Game Will Have Naval Combat

If Ubisoft opt for the Viking setting, adding naval combat would make perfect sense. Naval warfare was always a big part of the Viking lifestyle. Thankfully, we already know that naval combat can work really well in Assassin’s Creed games.

Black Flag is the perfect example of how naval combat and sea exploration can expand on the Assassin’s Creed universe in an exciting new way. I’d absolutely love to see a return to this kind of gameplay in the next Assassin’s Creed game.

If rumours are to be true, you may once again be given the option to commandeer your own ship. Some speculation suggests that you’ll be pitted up against a rival Viking clan and will regularly be put into naval combat situations whilst exploring the deep sea.

Blending Stealth With The Typical Viking Archetype

Whilst Assassin’s Creed games can often be so different from one another, one element always stays the same throughout the franchise.

As the name would suggest Assassin’s Creed always implements some kind of stealth into the gameplay. Typically, you wouldn’t consider a Viking to be particularly stealthy – they’re often looked at as tough, heavy-hitting combatants.

It will be interesting to see how Ubisoft blend the stealth elements of past Assassin’s Creed titles into a Viking style game.

Interestingly, there is some history that suggests Vikings weren’t as brutish as one may think. In the past, Vikings would use a mixture of deceit and stealth to take down their enemies.

One thing that is important to note is that Vikings would often do anything they could to carry out attacks. Vikings were known to be ruthless, but that didn’t mean they were always running in head first to combat. Instead, Vikings were actually smart thinkers that’d use any means possible to get an edge in combat.

Perhaps if the new Assassin’s Creed game was set in the Viking era, we could see a variety of options for players to choose how they want to take out enemies. A variety of improvised weapons alongside different options for stealthy or non-stealthy approaches could be considered.

For when things get really tough, Ubisoft could add some kind of Bezerk combat mode that would make dealing with waves of enemies less challenging.

What Will Be The Backstory For The Next Assassin’s Creed Game?

In past Assassin’s Creed games, there have often been references to religion or the gods in some way or another. Usually, religion has played a big part of the story for past games in the franchise.

During the Viking era, many believed in the Norse gods. Could we some kind of reference to the Norse gods in the backstory for the next Assassin’s Creed game? I think it’s totally possible.

In the past, Vikings would also pillage religious sites and attack places that were particularly vulnerable.

The cause of their ruthlessness was often attributed to honoring a particular Norse god. Many believed that Vikings would attain spiritual powers by honoring the gods in this way, so perhaps there could be some level of this reflected in the next AC game.

What Weapons Will Be In The Next Assassin’s Creed Game?

Weapons are always a big part of Assassin’s Creed, and the Viking era makes a perfect opportunity for Ubisoft to create some truly legendary weapons.

Whilst we’re not sure what kind of unique weapons could be added to the next game, we do know there is likely to be some common Viking weapon archetypes seen throughout.

Here’s a look at some of the weapons you can expect to see if the next Assassin’s Creed game is based on the Vikings.

Battle axes

Perhaps the most iconic Viking weapon is the battle axe. Whilst it’s popular belief that Vikings used the battle axe as their weapon of choice, it was more often used as a tool, for example, for ship building.

Usually, battle axes were only used in combat during Viking raids. It’d be interesting to see a range of different battle axes in the next Assassin’s Creed.

Ubisoft could introduce smaller battle axes useful for taking down enemies silently, longer axes for battering through crowds of enemies, and maybe even throwing axes to take down enemies from a distance.

Spears

The most commonly used Viking weapon was the spear. There were typically two types of spears used – throwing spears and spears for close quarter combat. Both types of spears could fit into an Assassin’s Creed game quite well.

Shields

Many Vikings went without helmets and usually only the wealthiest of Vikings could afford to wear one. However, shields were commonplace. In fact, almost all Vikings had shields. The shields were made out of softwood. This made sure that they were cheap to produce and very expendable.

Summary

Do you think an Assassin’s Creed game set in the Viking era could be good fun? If not, where else do you think the next game should be set?

He's not exactly one of the biggest name players in world of soccer or in FIFA 18, but it's still interesting to see an easter egg pertaining to the crowd and using a players face in the game as a fan.

That's all the article says. Urgh this one annoyed me. ",https://trib.al/dltFz9S,"There are a bunch of interesting weapons in Destiny 2. Auto rifles, rocket launchers, swords, and weirdo reverse-tractor beams. But which guns are best? Here’s our list of the top five.

5. MIDA Multi-Tool

The exotic scout rifle MIDA Multi-Tool is pretty easy to get. It probably has the least stringent requirements of any of Destiny 2’s exotic quests. Once you get it, you’ll have a gun that lives up to its name. It’s got so many uses! Obviously, it’s good at long range. But it staggers enemies really effectively, so it’s solid at close range, too. You really don’t need to use anything else.

4. MIDA Multi-Tool

The best thing about the MIDA Multi-Tool is that it lets you keep your radar active when you aim down your sights. That puts it way above most other guns for PvP, particularly in the more intense modes on the competitive playlist or during Trials of the Nine. Destiny 2 has increased the time it takes for your radar to come back after you aim down the sights of a normal gun, making the MIDA’s radar perk that much more valuable. It’s a no-brainer.

3. MIDA Multi-Tool

There’s plenty of new stuff in Destiny 2, so it’s comforting to use a gun that we’re all already familiar with. MIDA Multi-Tool is one of several Destiny 2 exotics that Bungie carried over from the first game. It’s been floating around the meta since waaaay back in 2014, and it just wouldn’t be Destiny if that weren’t still the case. Sequels are all about using the same guns we’ve been using for three years, right? It’s so nice to stick with what we know.

2. MIDA Multi-Tool

If you’re competing in Trials of the Nine, chances are most of your teammates are going to be using the MIDA Multi-Tool. You wouldn’t want to stick out, right? Of course not! Don’t be a weirdo! You can always equip a good auto rifle in your energy slot, if you really want to use something different from time to time. But let’s be real: if we could have our way, we’d just equip a MIDA Multi-Tool in both slots! We guess that’s what the MIDA Mini-Tool is for.

1. MIDA Multi-Tool

The MIDA Multi-Tool won our hearts years ago with its iconic “death stapler” firing sound, and we definitely have yet to get sick of it! It’s so refreshing to go into a crucible match and immediately hear that clipped thwack coming from every angle. Why use any other gun when you can use one that sounds this good? It’s a fair question.

212,"Because it there is a sign that says ""take out"" rather than ""take away"". ",https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-apologizes-to-entire-country-of-australia/1100-6452793/,"Overwatch game director Jeff Kaplan has issued an apology to the entire country of Australia over perceived ""cultural insensitivity"" regarding the new Junkertown map.

Kaplan responded on Reddit, saying he is sorry about this mistake, and pledging that a future patch will fix it. ""I'd like to offer a direct apology to the entire country of Australia. Please forgive our cultural insensitivity. We will fix this in an upcoming patch (the sign travesty will most likely go live for some period before being fixed),"" he said.

Update, 3:47 p.m. EST/EDT: Looks like they’re already completely sold out.

Is there a catch? Of course there is. ThinkGeek claims to have thousands of units in stock, courtesy of its parent company GameStop. They’re available for purchase as of 3pm EST today, but while ThinkGeek won’t be selling its NES Classic Editions with as steep a markup as most eBay sellers do, you’ll still only be able to buy the sought after console as part of a bundle with other Nintendo merchandise.

The cheapest bundle, which includes box art, a Legend of Zelda puzzle, and a Piranha plant puppet, pushes the console’s price tag to $140, more than twice what the NES Classic Edition originally cost. Other bundles include collectibles like Zelda shield backpacks and stackable Tetris lamps, but the most expensive option will cost $220 and come with a Mega Man wearable helmet and Proto Man Buster blaster replica. Can you guess which bundle will sell out the fastest?

Where exactly did these unsold units of an unbelievably coveted gadget come from? ThinkGeek and GameStop won’t say. There’s an element of shameless cash grab going on here, but at least the mini consoles will make their way to the hands of fans sitting at their computers right now.

Nintendo has promised to ramp up production for its forthcoming SNES Classic Edition, which brings with it a never-before-released sequel to Star Fox. But Nintendo has a notorious history of releasing hardware with a limited supply to bolster demand (remember the eternal lineups for the Wii?) so you might still have a hard time getting the SNES Classic Edition on launch day in September.

",https://fraghero.com/gta-v-players-trigger-secret-hidden-mission-finds-alien-crash-site-game/,"Recently, some clues emerged that something was going to happen involving the Chiliad mystery.

People had scoured the source code for the Gunrunner update, and found some clues involving Chiliad, aliens, government agents, a busted up spaceship, and more.

Now, the pieces are falling into place. It still required a little ingenuity to trigger the mission:

“Well guys, R* made the trigger for this mission quite hard to work out in the scripts,” via a discussion on the subreddit for the Chiliad Mystery.

“We knew that it all depended on a particular global variable being set to 20… so we just went ahead and forced it to be 20 using a great tool made by polivilas on our discord!! Our very own Guru WetNips managed to force the global and spawn what looks to be just another supply mission, with a twist…”

The twist is that you’re making your way over to a crash-landed UFO, and stealing alien eggs, and taking them back to your bunker while ominous music plays and aliens try to stop you.

216,They did it for fun. ,https://compete.kotaku.com/15-years-later-heres-why-a-gamer-was-duct-taped-to-a-c-1796679499,"Few photos from the forum ages of online gaming live in greater infamy than one of what appears to be a human duct taped to the ceiling of a dimly lit basement, his arms reaching out to lightly graze the keys of a Dell mechanical keyboard.

Many have laid claim to this image. “I was there,” they say. “It was me, I took this photo,” others declared. We reached out to those people—most didn’t respond or couldn’t provide proof. But one thread surfaced: a group of small-town gamers who hauled computers to each other’s houses to play, among other games, Counter-Strike.

The picture in question originates from Mason, Michigan, where a close group of friends who liked to build personal computers and organize LAN parties grew up. Through Reddit and email, we were able to get in touch with a large portion of the group, as well as obtain verification and additional images.

Through all our interviews, members of the group laughed at the claims of Internet fakers and commenters.

“I don’t want to say it’s a closely guarded secret,” said Brian Schaeffer, one of the LAN goers. “But half the fun of seeing that picture pop up on the internet is all the stories where people say, ‘Oh yeah I know the people there.’ No you don’t! It was a small town, a random group of friends, and we literally just got goofy one day.”



The group told me they would hang out together in various houses and, sometimes, even a tire warehouse, lugging computer rigs to locations to play a variety of games. It was the summer of 2002, and at the time, Counter-Strike was the game to play. Others recount games like Command & Conquer, both Renegade and Red Alert 2, as well as Battlefield 1942 (for those with the 512 MB RAM to run it) and StarCraft custom games. Counter-Strike was the great equalizer. It could run on just about anything, and everyone had it.

For the Mason alumni, the night they taped Drew Purvis to the ceiling was just an average day, another LAN party with friends.

“It was still early in the day and the LAN had already become fractured,” said Nick Wellman, another LAN goer. “There were about 10 of us there, and we were already playing three, four different games. Tyler was looking around and said, ‘I think you can duct tape someone to that I-beam.’”

Advertisement

At this point, the teens gathered the necessary supplies, bought duct tape on a friend’s employee discount and had the tallest attendee, Brian, hold the subject, Drew, aloft while the rest taped him up.

Advertisement

What you see in the now-iconic photo is actually the group’s second attempt to suspend their friend from the ceiling with duct tape. After about 10 minutes, the tape digging into his sides, Drew asked to be cut down. They revised their plan, adding pillows, and strapped him back up. Once on the beam, someone else had the idea to stack some tables up so Drew could still play on his computer.

“That is the funniest part about the picture,” Nick told us. “Gaming from the beam was a complete afterthought.”

Drew lasted about two hours suspended above his comrades before retiring to the ground (turns out a duct tape cocoon runs hot).

Brian, who happened to bring along his digital camera from photography class that day, saved some snapshots to commemorate the moment. Drew posted the photos to a gaming forum, where it would stay duct-taped to the memories of gamers for all eternity. (We reached out to Drew for this story, and made contact, but he didn’t get back to us in time before publishing.)

“We tried to keep a list of all the places we saw the picture pop up, but it just kept started showing up in more and more places,” said Brian. “It also speaks to how when something’s on the internet, it’s always going to be up there, you can’t hide it.”

Advertisement

For the Mason alumni, it’s a little reminder of a simpler time.



“It’s so funny, because if you see the Reddit threads, every time this picture goes around every couple years it’s like a little Mason reunion,” said Jonathan Watrous, another LAN-goer.

Advertisement

Those mini-reunions in the comment sections of this picture help keep the group together and caught up, long after it splintered and scattered to the wind. Some still try to get together, either online through modern games like League of Legends or in-person.

“Not quite LAN parties,” said Brian of recent Mason get-togethers. “We’ve done some of those, but we’re all adults. Dragging the rigs around aren’t quite as easy as it was back then, and we’re all adults now, too. We had more time back then.”

The photo remains an indelible reminder of a time when rigs were dragged into basements and parents were kept awake by the mechanical clacking of keys to the cadence of Counter-Strike.

“I don’t see most of the people in the picture all that often, but this was before smartphones and ubiquitous social media,” said Nathan Gamber, another LAN attendee. “So it’s one of the few moments in that time that we’re reminded of every couple years.”",2017-07-10 07:27:15
217,If they can make the remaster look 'great'. ,https://fraghero.com/rockstar-is-open-to-remastering-gta-games-but-only-if-this-condition-is-met,"Take-Two Interactive spoke in detail about a lot of things during a recent investor call and it shared some details regarding Rockstar Games’ policy about doing remastered versions of old Grand Theft Auto titles such as San Andreas and GTA III. (Take-Two Interactive owns Rockstar Games.)

The company made it clear that it’s not adverse to the idea but it isn’t overly eager to do it either. It’ll only pursue such opportunities if it’s confident that it can make the remaster look ‘great‘,

Take-Two Interactive’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, explained in detail about its approach to GTA remasters when asked if games such as Vice City and GTA III might ever make it to current gen consoles.

He assured people that this was something “[Rockstar Games] will decide in due course,” but warned that it “wouldn’t do anything that’s not going to look great creatively.”



The starting point is, ‘Is this going to delight customers, is this going to look good?’. “You know that we’re a company that is not driven first and foremost by ‘Can we create revenue this way?’ We would start by saying, ‘Will this be exciting to consumers, will they be happy with it, will it reflect well on our brand, will it reflect well on our company?’ And if the answer is yes, then it may well be a compelling opportunity. But if the answer is indifferent or no then even if we have an opportunity to make a few bucks we probably would decline. I think that’s the lens through which we look, the actual decisions are made by the labels [Rockstar and 2K].

It’s clear from his statement that Rockstar Games would do justice to any Grand Theft Auto remasters, if they decide to do them. It might eventually happen if fans really want it but don’t expect Take-Two to dive into it for some quick and easy money as they value the GTA brand too dearly to pull off such gimmicks.

Take-Two also delighted fans by revealing that Rockstar Games is currently working on Red Dead Redemption 2, so there’s plenty to look forward to.",2017-07-10 07:22:56
218,"No. But it is a good idea to have access to a second OS.
",http://www.game-debate.com/news/22991/opinion-is-it-time-to-say-goodbye-to-windows-and-use-a-different-operating-system,"Computer hardware is constantly evolving, and so too do operating systems (OS). Roughly nine years ago, Windows XP Service Pack 3 was released. I wouldn't hesitate to consider it a major driving force which let people to mass adoption of PCs in a manner we hadn't seen before. Since then, the operating systems have evolved rapidly. Nowadays, we can really choose which operating system to use, and people are slowly starting to explore other options than vanilla Windows. This may be caused by dissatisfaction with the current Windows 10 situation; uncertainty about upgrading from whatever OS they are using right now, or just out of curiosity to try something different.

Most people buy devices with pre-installed Windows or use Windows because they have been using it all the time. It's not a coincidence the latest Windows 10 concerns only about 26% of desktop market share (Windows OSes together take about 90% of all desktop OSes market share), but is it really the unquestionably best OS to go for right now, or are there other ""usable"" options? Can we use different operating systems, or even live without Windows completely?

It may sound strange, but in order to answer such a question, we need to truly understand what an operating system does and why do we need it. An operating system manages computer hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs. All computer programs (excluding firmware) require an operating system to function. It acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware (although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function). To put it simply, the OS is our computer essential software servant designed to let us use our programs, play games and make use of the fancy gear we have. It should be easy to use, safe and reliable. These are its specific purposes.

So, we could get a quick conclusion right away, that whatever OS matches those demands above is a great OS to use, right? Well, it's not that simple. There's a lot more to consider. For example, graphical user interface (GUI) design defines ""ease of use"" and additional features are often seductive, but do those actually matter?

Windows, OS(X) and Linux are major players at OS market, so allow me to sum up some of the major pros and cons found in each.

Microsoft Windows

Introduced over 30 years ago, it has matured and spread to become the #1 globally recognise OS brand. Microsoft ensured most of the hardware manufacturers and software developers can rely on Windows, and that Windows can rely on them. This makes life for us, the end users, fairly easy. Microsoft offers only a few software products, Microsoft Office and Skype are practically the only ones, with Internet Explorer and Edge being part of Windows itself. Hardware products by Microsoft were practically non-existent until recently, when Microsoft launched the Surface device family (Book, Laptop, Pro, Studio). Everything else is third-party software and hardware.

Cons about Windows include system-wide vulnerability to malware, gradual congestion of the OS, registry bloating, user profile corruption, complicated (un)installing of software/hardware and updates, relatively high resource usage (CPU/RAM/disk) which may often cause perceived slower response times. Last but not least, it's fairly expensive by default - Windows 10 Pro download version costs about $325 / £220 on Microsoft's website, which isn't an insignificant amount of money considering it's the price for which GTX1060 cards are being sold in my country. There are cheaper resellers out there, but they come with their own associated risks.

Meanwhile, the recent launch of Windows 10 S indicates that the future of Windows may be as a subscription-based as-a-service closed ecosystem fully relying on UWP Store apps, which definitely isn't something people will easily adopt. This may be a serious game changer, and may mean that what we know as Windows nowadays will cease to exist entirely.

Apple Mac OS(X)

Released even before Windows, Apple's Macintosh System Software the became first ever successful graphical-based operating system. Apple ensured only very limited hardware configurations are supported, providing own Apple-branded devices (Macbook Air/Pro, iMac, Mac Pro). This helps devs to optimise software and hardware more precisely which results in better stability and more optimised resource usage. Apple provides a complete set of software, including audio and video editors (iMovie, GarageBand, or higher-end Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X) and many others.

Cons about OS(X) are actually very few, but they are major - OS(X) is available to Apple devices only (although it's possible to make custom 'Hackintosh' on non-certified hardware, which requires some fiddling and isn't supported by Apple); the second major problem is a lack of games and software for this platform - some devs release their software for multiple platforms, but the majority of games are relying on Microsoft's DirectX and other Microsoft's APIs, which obviously means no support outside of Windows. Also, it's worth mentioning OS(X) and updates are ""free"", provided only with Apple hardware - which in itself is multiple times more expensive compared to computers and laptops designed for Windows, and although they don't age quite so badly, they still become old and weak sooner or later.

Linux

At first, let's point out Linux itself is NOT an operating system, but a kernel, which needs to be bundled with additional components - those bundles are called 'distributions' or simply 'distros', of which the most popular are Ubuntu, Mint and Fedora. There are hundreds of distros to pick from, and practically all (aside from a few enterprise-targeted support-covered distros) are FREE. Yes, you read that right - entirely free, and usually also free to modify. Also worth mentioning is the fact most distros can be run from a USB stick, even without installation, so they're very easy to try out without messing with whatever OS is installed as the primary.

Cons are similar as those of OS(X), representing a minority of market share, there aren't too many software and hardware devs actively supporting and developing their products for Linux, and so the variety of available software is very limited. There aren't many vendors selling Linux computers, so common practice is to buy Windows-targeted hardware and just run Linux on it - which sometimes may be tricky. Some distros are designed with ease of use in mind, but generally, Linux installations require a moderate degree of computer knowledge and patience to make them work fine.

Conclusion

Although those systems differ a lot, I would say that a major decision point is software and hardware compatibility - the best I can recommend is to try multiple OSes and decide what is needed and what's not. The worst we can do is passively ignore the fact Windows is no longer the only choice nowadays, although it's true Windows 10 is likely to remain the platform for AAA games and so probably the most hassle-free for gamers... for now.

Is it time to say goodbye to Windows? Not yet, but why not have an alternative OS available in case a broken update makes your primary OS unbootable and you'll need to use your PC or access your files?

I tested plenty of Linux distros during the past few years, then about half year ago started using OS(X) El Capitan just out of curiosity (Hackintosh successful), leaving Windows 7 installed alongside, and I realized all software I use is multiplatform and of the little free time left to play games, I can play most of those on OS(X) directly. No longer being dependent on Windows, I don't think I even booted Windows 7 on my rig during the past six months. And although I really enjoy exploring Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB version on another rig, I am happy to have stable, reliable OS(X) on my primary workstation. I'm planning to try out some decent Linux distros, maybe Chrome OS, to replace Windows on my ancient HTPC rig in living room later as well.

What are your thoughts on current operating system options? Do you feel dependent on OS you're using now? Would you consider to test out something new or you don't have time to waste learning entirely different environment? Let us know in comments below :)",2017-07-08 11:35:39
219,They reinstated OpenIV - basically means GTA players can mod again. ,https://fraghero.com/rockstar-games-comes-rescue-angry-gta-v-players/,"About a week and a half ago, Take Two Interactive, and by extension, Rockstar Games, did the unthinkable- they banned the largest modding tool available in GTA V, OpenIV.

Understandably, the community was outraged. The Rockstar Games and GTA V forums were alight with the righteous fury of modders around the world. The Steam rating for GTA V went from a very respectable “Mostly Positive” to “Overwhelmingly Negative” over the course of just a few days. It looked like the end of one of the biggest online communities in both console and PC gaming.

Supposedly, Take Two shut down OpenIV because some of the mods that were developed specifically for the single player mode had made their way over to GTA Online, “ruining” the integrity of the game. After the shutdown, all seemed lost. It looked like the era of GTA V’s online dominance was coming to a close.

But then- a hero emerged.

Rockstar Games was able to talk down its parent company, Take Two, and get the OpenIV system reinstated in GTA V.

That’s right, OpenIV is back up.

Rockstar remained very quiet during this entire ordeal, and only gave neutral, polite responses to any questions asked. Based on their abnormal behavior, it seems as if Take Two took the reins and shut down OpenIV against the will of Rockstar’s GTA V teams. Thankfully, the hard-working crew at Rockstar was able to save OpenIV, and by extension, all of the mods made in the 3 and a half years that the game has been out and, by extension, GTA V itself.",2017-06-30 11:07:17

The cash will be directly deposited into the players’ online accounts, and it’ll be distributed among PS4, Xbox One, and PC players.

All you need to do in order to receive this cash reward is log in to the game sometime between now and April 30. Anyone who does that, who have the cash credited to their accounts by May, in their Maze Bank.

221,"Yes? No? Doesn't matter they aren't ready yet. Samsung just had a patent for this kind of technology approved which brings them on level with Google that has two patents for similar products. No release date, no details, just speculation on how the technology could be used. Not technically clickbait but it is a massively misleading title. ",https://fraghero.com/ready-play-games-directly-eyeball/,"The future is officially here, ladies and gentlemen.

The government of South Korea has just approved a patent for Samsung’s latest futuristic technological advancement– smart contact lenses. Samsung’s patent puts them on a level playing field with tech giant Google, which has 2 patents for similar hardware.

The contact lenses, which will project images directly onto the eye of the user, will be used as augmented reality hardware. The possibilities with this sort of technology are nearly endless. For example, Samsung’s (or Google’s) smart contacts could show you the outdoor temperature when you look outside. When partnered with GPS apps like Google Maps or Waze, these smart contacts could act as a real-life heads up display like you see in videogames like Forza Motorsport.

On top of these daily uses, smart contacts open up a plethora of possibilities for surgeons, first responders, and tons of other professionals. Surgeons could have “x-ray vision” that would assist them with surgery, along with live vital monitoring HUD’s. First responders could have information given to them via their contacts as situations transpire.

Oh, and don’t forget the gaming possibilities. Remember Pokemon Go? It was pretty cool on phones, but imagine how amazing it would be if you could see the Pokemon without having to look through your phone. Augmented reality games would finally gain the support and popularity they’ve been trying to get for years.

There are no dates yet for when this tech will be available to the public, but keep an *eye* open for announcements from Google and Samsung.",2017-06-27 02:00:50
222,"It's going live on June 27th on PS4 and PC (other platforms to follow) and will cost $40, with an additional cost of $15 for the ""Variety Map Pack"" which was originally a free add on. ",https://fraghero.com/modern-warfare-remastered-officially-confirmed-bad-news/,"The standalone version of Modern Warfare: Remastered has finally been announced for everyone who took a pass on last year’s higher-end CoD bundles but still wants to relive the glory years. The only problem is there’s a few problems with that.

For starters, it’s going to cost $40. That’s forty big ones for a remastered version of a game that was already released last year. It’s going to drop on June 27th for PC and PS4 in digital format as well as physical copies, and they’ve said other platforms are to follow.

If $40 feels steep, wait until you hear the rest of the news…

The “Variety Map Pack” which was originally included for the low, low price of free will now also cost an additional $15. So, if you want the full Modern Warfare experience, you’re basically dishing out the cost of an entire new game, which is a tough proposition, especially when you can grab PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS for a cool $29.99, or just wait for Call of Duty: World War 2 which promises to be a throwback to the classic CoD titles that still hold a special place in the hearts of many gamers.

Releasing a remastered version of one of the best Call of Duty titles was a chance for some real good will in the gaming community, especially on the heals of a huge CoD launch this year that has a lot of people looking forward to it, including people who had completely lost interest in the series of the past few iterations. Instead, they’re not only nickel and diming gamers, they’re $5 and $10’ing us.",2017-06-26 11:10:27
223,"The mount chiliad mystery mural. Source code in the gunrunners update containing an alien egg, a crashed space ship and Area 51 agents. None of the code is in use yet but might be in store for a future update. ",https://fraghero.com/gta-v-players-finally-find-new-clue-solving-games-oldest-mystery/,"If you think you’ve done and seen everything there is to do and see in GTA V, chances are you’re wrong, but some people are starting to get closer to unraveling one of the game’s biggest and longest running mysteries thanks to some help from Rockstar themselves.

Not only has Rockstar been very dedicated to adding new features and updating things to keep people interested, but GTA V has built a rabid fanbase that just can’t seem to get enough, even as they navigate rocky terrain like the whole modding issue.

In GTA V’s highly anticipated Gunrunner update, players have found some code that hints at a solution to the epic Chiliad Mystery, one of the most intriguing little “side quests” in the game that ultimately leads you to the top of a mountain in the early morning to see a UFO. This mystery has spawned all sorts of crazy theories, and it seems like things may finally be getting resolved a whole four years later.

During that time, people have been searching high and low for a meaning to this mystery, even putting together big search parties of people to scour the source code, but no luck… until now.

In the source code for the Gunrunner update, there are things like aliens, an alien egg, a UFO that looks like it crash landed, and government agents who seem like they’re right out of Area 51.

It’s unclear how, if it all, you can activate all of this, or if they’re just tossing it in now with plans for a future update down the road. The smoking gun is that all of these new additions are tied to Fort Zancudo, which is no stranger to alien activity already.

Either way, there’s essentially a cult of people who have been obsessed with solving this mystery for years, and so this is huge news for the GTA V community and we’ll keep you posted with any new findings.",2017-06-26 02:00:36
224,You'll still have to put in the Infinite Warfare disk. ,https://fraghero.com/theres-bad-news-already-copy-modern-warfare-remastered/,"The bad news just keeps piling up. After an earlier announcement regarding Activision’s re-release of Modern Warfare: Remastered separate from Infinite Warfare, Activision gave us even more to be upset about.

Despite the fact that Modern Warfare: Remastered will be re-released as a standalone title, gamers who don’t buy the new version will still be tethered to their copy of Infinite Warfare. That’s right, even though the game will be released separately, gamers who have already purchased Infinite Warfare + Modern Warfare: Remastered will not be gifted a separate virtual copy of the game. Instead, they’ll still have to put the Infinite Warfare disc in their console every time they want to play Modern Warfare.

On top of that, the earlier statement from Activision regarding the standalone re-release of Modern Warfare remastered contained even more bad news for gamers. The game will cost fans $40 (a ridiculous amount for a re-release of a remaster) and it won’t even include the $15 of DLC that have been released so far. That puts the price tag for the new version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered to $55.

It’s very possible that Activision made this poorly received decision as a smart business move- there are probably quite a few gamers out there that will buy the re-release plus DLC just so they can get rid of the Infinite Warfare disc. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Remastered will be released later this month.",2017-06-25 19:25:56

227,"You're all all gamers, you've heard of these features before. Examples: connect a keyboard, connect your phone, play cross platform, connect an external hard drive...

P.s. I don't even own an Xbox and I knew all these features.",https://fraghero.com/10-things-didnt-know-xbox-one/,"Gone are the days when consoles were just simple boxes that had an On or Off Button. Nowadays they are transformed into complex machines that feature all kinds of interesting characteristics, social aspects and online connectivity meant to make the gameplay even more enjoyable than before. If you are curious about what your Xbox One packs inside, here are 10 of the most interesting things you didn’t know your favorite console could do.

Connect a Keyboard



Connecting a keyboard to your Xbox One might seem like an unintuitive thing to do since the whole point of using a console is sitting back and relaxing on the sofa with the controller in hand. But there are situations when such an option might come in handy, for example: a case where you want to write a message to a friend. Even though you might not use this feature on a daily basis, it’s still good to know that it exists on the Xbox One.

Customize your Dashboard

If you’ve gotten bored with the standard look of your home screen you’ll be glad to know that you can actually change various little things to make it more personal. By opening the “Settings” application and selecting the Personalization tab you will be able to access “My color & background” section where you’ll find various options. The background can be switched to any color you want and, in addition, you can even opt to use personal pictures, achievement art or a screenshot that you’ve taken.

Use your Phone as a Controller



For those moments when you get extra comfortable and sink into your couch after a long day of work, there’s nothing worse than realizing that the controller is way out of your reach. Luckily, it turns out that you can control your Xbox One directly through your smartphone or tablet, you just have to install a specific app for iOS or Android, log into your account and you’re good to go. This is a useful feature your Xbox one has and it would be a shame not to take advantage of it.

Customize the Controller



For ease of use or just because you like a certain configuration of the buttons, you can easily customize your controller by opening the Xbox Accessories application and playing with the adjustable settings you find there. After you’ve selected the “Configure” option, you’re free to rearrange the buttons in any manner you like and think fits your style best, because it’s very important to be able to handle your controller in the most comfortable of ways.

Broadcast Play Sessions



This option is especially useful for the aspiring streamers or YouTubers out there who want to show the entire world their prowess in playing video games. All you need to do is download the Twitch application, sign in and select the “Broadcast” option, then it will be automatically snapped to the right side of your screen and you can name it and tweak its settings. It’s good to know that such a feature is available on the Xbox One because it really makes many gamers’ life easier.

Add an External Hard Drive



In terms of usefulness, this option really tops it all. Adding an external hard drive to your Xbox One is one of the best things you can do with your console, because once you’ve ran out of the native 500GB space you’ll no longer have to delete the games or videos you’ve got in your collection. By simply connecting an external storage device to one of the USB ports available, you’ll be gaining a lot of new space to install the newest gaming titles on.

Share Games with your Friends



If you set your Xbox One as your “home” Xbox, all the other accounts that are linked to the system gain access to your games, even when you are not logged in. In this way, individual users are able to set up their own save files and earn personal achievements without affecting the game progression of the other members that use the same console. In the same way, if a friend is willing to set their “home” as your house, then both of you will have access to each other’s games for ever.

Use your Xbox One on a Win 10 PC



Once you’ve setup your Xbox One on your home network you are able to access it from any PC that runs Windows 10, so if you find yourself sitting at your desk and feeling the need to play some games that you have on your console, you can access it in a very simple way. You just have to open up the app in Windows and your Xbox One will be instantly turned on, allowing you to access your game library and choose whatever you’d like to play.

Play Cross-Platform



The dream scenario where you can play video games with your friends even if they are using a different system has finally come true. Now you can enjoy an online match with your mates thanks to the cross-platform feature that allows you to get together with PC users. Important titles like Gears of War 4, Killer Instinct, and Rocket League all let you play cooperatively or competitively against your friends, which is downright extraordinary!

Film Yourself in Green Screen videos



Upload Studio is the official video editor offered by Xbox One and even though it’s a free software, it’s surprisingly resourceful and has a lot of cool features to offer. Besides the usual ones that let you edit your gameplay clips into videos, this editor also has a powerful Kinect feature, namely it lets you record yourself as if you had a green screen setup. This is an extraordinary perk, taking into consideration the fact that most of us don’t have a designated green screen setup in our homes.",2017-06-24 11:00:42

This topic came up due to the forced split-screen in A Way Out (Even when playing online), which requires more processing power.

In an interview with Engadget, the director of A Way Out, Josef Fares, said that the PS4 isn’t as powerful as people think it is, and that it’s holding back game development.

These comments have some console gamers upset to the point of wanting to boycott this game and the previous title he directed, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. That seems a bit extreme. If you’re not interested in the game, that’s one thing. If you were interested until he compared the PS4 to a 5 year old PC, you might want to reconsider.

It’s an odd comment to make, either way. The PS4 came out in 2013 and it’s 2017 now so the console itself is nearly 5 years old. Also, the average PC gamer isn’t playing on a bleeding edge system and a mid range PC from a few years ago isn’t going to be worlds different from a current generation console in terms of what they can play.. It does stand to reason that developers aren’t going to go balls to the walls to max out high-end gaming PCs with their games when most people won’t be able to play those games, but to attribute a lack of innovation to the hardware limits on consoles seems strange as well.",2017-06-24 02:00:13

But take a closer look at the picture. You'll be shocked when you see it!

They make a huge mess and are a total waste of deliciousness, but cake smashes are unarguably always adorable. That’s why when this mom of multiples decided to do one for her daughters’ first birthdays, she wanted to make it extra special.

UK mom Lara Mason recently posted photos on Facebook showing off her awesome cake smash photoshoot starring her twin daughters, Lyla and Lily. Yep, you read that correctly. Her daughters are twins, not quadruplets.

Now, it’s totally cool if you’re a little confused. We were too. But take a closer look at the picture and you’ll notice the two babies in the middle aren’t babies at all—they’re cakes.

In addition to being a mom, Mason also owns her own bakery where she makes fun customized cakes like the ones you’ve seen on the Food Network and TLC. With her daughters’ birthdays approaching, she decided to go big and make cake versions of her baby girls. “Not a lot of other people do this crazy thing that I do so I thought to myself… Why not?!” she wrote in her Facebook post. “I mean, what other kids get to say that their mum made them life-size cakes of themselves for their 1st birthday!?” Take a look at the video she posted along side her photos:

The twins with their Cake twins! Posted by Lara Mason Cake Art on Thursday, February 15, 2018

Now, we’ve seen a lot of those cake shows, so we know that making cake people look even somewhat realistic is a super tall order. And because they were her own children, Mason made sure to put extra special care into making these cake figures. “The cakes have taken a fair few hours—I’d say about 100 to 120 hours over the last few weeks,” Mason told the Motherload. “It’s the most critical I have ever been while making ‘cake people’ because I feel like I did such a good job making them so cute in the first place!”

Props to you, Lara Mason. You had a vision and you went for it. We just have one question: Did you and your family eat the cake babies? Because we’re thinking that might be pretty weird.

231,No. #stopclickbait,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hand-sanitizer-explodes-hot-car/,"Editor’s note: Fire experts warn that a plastic bottle containing any liquid — including, but not limited to, hand sanitizer — left in a car and exposed to direct sunlight can potentially focus sunlight into a beam hot enough to start a fire. The following article deals specifically with the specific claim that hand sanitizer will “spontaneously combust” if left in a hot car.

In April 2020, a series of photographs started to circulate on WhatsApp and Telegram that supposedly showed the aftermath of a car fire caused by an unattended bottle of hand sanitizer.

These posts, many of which were written in Portuguese, urged people to be cautious about leaving hand sanitizer in their cars because, they claimed, it can spontaneously combust.

A month or so after these posts went viral in Brazil, a similar rumor started to circulate on English-language pages. In addition to being spread by anonymous social media users, these warnings also made their way onto the pages of a real fire departments. The Western Lakes Fire District of Wisconsin (WLFD) in Wisconsin, for instance, shared the following post to its Facebook page on May 21:

Soon after, a number of news outlets picked up on this story and ran articles about how a fire department was warning people not to leave hand sanitizer in their cars. Although WLFD truly did post the above-displayed warning, the department later removed the post for stirring confusion.

For starters, the picture has not been officially linked to a fire caused by a bottle of hand sanitizer exploding into flame. A number of experts have also weighed in to say that while hand sanitizer does contain alcohol and is flammable, it would require a tremendous amount of heat for spontaneous combustion. Although this sort of fire may be technically possible (more on that later), we’ve yet to see any official reports about a car fire starting this way. Lastly, the WLFD did state that a fire could be started via “magnification of light through the bottle,” but this is true for any plastic bottle and has little to do with its contents.

WLFD deleted its original hand sanitizer warning and replaced it with the following message:

Our goal in the WLFD is to provide timely, accurate, and educational information while responding to the needs of our customers. It’s become clear that a recent post about hand sanitizer was taken in many different directions from our original goal. We want to take the opportunity to clear up some misunderstandings and assure our position is understood. While we never made the claim that the photo utilized was from our district or from an exploding container of hand sanitizer, it has become clear that that inference and speculation made is seem as though it was. It was to illustrate a door fire resulting from contact with open flame which was the center of our post. Our message was intended to center on preventing fire or injury from the use of hand sanitizer. It also regarded the past history of issues stemming from clear bottles being stored in vehicles. These bottles typically store bottled water or as of late; hand sanitizer. While infrequent, there have been cases in the recent past were reflecting light placed through a clear bottle was able to focus onto a combustible surface and cause a fire. This has primarily been through water bottles but since hand sanitizer is often stored in the same vessel we wanted to pass it along for your safety. The principle is identical and obviously an additional issue would occur if it happened in the presence of an alcohol based product. The open flame comment was to remind people that when hand sanitizer is wet on any surface it will ignite when exposed to flame. With the recent increase in utilization of this product we wanted to remind our customers that it’s important not to allow this to occur. Many people have been sequestered in their homes and with an upcoming holiday accompanied with nice weather we knew grilling, fire pits, and other enjoyments would be in place. While we never referenced grilling in one’s vehicle, we did center on smoking and wanted to assure that the correlation was made illustrating that is also an open flame. We didn’t want anyone injured exercising good hygiene practices and then unintentionally coming in contact with open flame. Video representation of this happening is included for our fans to watch. We simply want our customers to be happy healthy and well and most importantly enjoy the time they have together with family and friends. Our message quickly came became misconstrued and we wanted to assure that we made it right. We apologize for any confusion and wish you an enjoyable holiday weekend.

Judging from the amount of mail Snopes received, many people were still confused about what dangers may lurk in bottles of hand sanitizer. So let’s take a closer look at the questions this viral post sparked.

Is Hand Sanitizer Flammable?

Many hand sanitizers contain alcohol, and these alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) are flammable. The Federal Aviation Administration wrote in a 2010 report:

As expected, hand sanitizer is flammable and can easily be ignited with a common grill lighter when poured into a pan. It tends to burn relatively cool, compared to fuel, plastic, or cellulose fires with peak flame temperatures between 500° and 1000°F. The observed temperatures above the flame were higher for the liquid hand sanitizer compared to the gel.

Hand sanitizers also give off vapors, and these vapors are also flammable.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes:

ABHS contains ethyl alcohol, which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor, and is considered a flammable liquid. Although the incidence of fires related to ABHS is very low, it is vital that ABHS is stored safely and that bulk dispensers are installed and maintained correctly.

Can Hand Sanitizer Spontaneously Combust?

One of the major fears that people had after encountering this rumor on social media was that their hand sanitizer was going to “spontaneously combust” if left too long in a hot car. We won’t say that this is impossible, but we will say that it is extremely unlikely.

According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), hand sanitizer would have to be exposed to extreme heats (over 700 degrees Fahrenheit) in order to spontaneously combust.

Spontaneous ignition, on the other hand, involves a substance self-heating to a point where it ignites, without the need for any outside ignition source like a flame. Hand sanitizer is not subject to self-heating and would require temperatures to reach over 700 degrees Fahrenheit to spontaneously ignite, according to Guy Colonna, director of Technical Services at NFPA.

Those sort of temperatures just aren’t going to be seen inside of a parked car (so long as that car is parked on Earth). A 2018 study published in the journal Temperature found that the average temperature in a parked car on a 95-degree day was about 116 degrees. Specific parts of the car, such as the dashboard, climbed closer to 160 degrees, but that is still far from the 700 degrees needed for spontaneous combustion.

The NFPA continued:

“Spontaneous ignition would be an ignition source independent of a flame or a spark, [and] it requires a material that is reactive to do what’s called self-heat,” Colonna says in a new video interview on the topic (above). “Internally, it undergoes a reaction and changes its properties, and when changing its properties, it releases lots of heat energy. Hand sanitizer, the alcohol [in it], is a material not inclined to do that. … The ignition temperature of the alcohols are going to be something in excess of 700 degrees Fahrenheit.” In other words, while hand sanitizer gives off ignitable vapors at roughly room temperature or above, that vapor-air mixture still needs to be exposed to very high temperatures to ignite. A flame can do it. A hot car can’t.

Can a Bottle of Hand Sanitizer Focus Sunlight into a Strong Enough Heat Source to Start a Fire?

This claim has more to do with the magnification properties of plastic bottles than it does with the contents of said bottles. In fact, in 2017, a similar warning was circulated on social media that said leaving a water bottle in your car on a hot day could result in a fire.

Live Science wrote:

Leaving a water bottle sitting in your car sounds benign enough. But on a hot, summer day, the plastic can act as a lens, focusing light into a high-energy beam that’s intense enough to burn material like car-seat upholstery. […] “The water bottle is acting like a lens that’s focusing the light coming through the window,” Odile Madden, a materials scientist at the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles, told Live Science. Light consists of numerous photons, which are subatomic particles that travel in a straight line, Madden said. Eyeglass and microscope lenses direct the photons so they converge on a point. “You can use that to see something better, get it in focus. Or, you can focus a lot of light onto a very small point and concentrate all that energy, and that can cause melting and burning,” Madden explained.

Although it is technically possible for a fire to start in this manner, again, it is very unlikely. The sun, the bottle, and a flammable source would all have to be in perfect alignment on a rather hot day to ignite a fire.

In June 2020, Illinois’ Waukegan Fire Department reported that a small bottle of hand sanitizer had started a car fire. The organization later amended their statement to clarify that the fire was started in the manner described above — a plastic bottle focusing direct sunlight into beam hot enough to start a fire — so its cause was unrelated to the substance in the bottle.

All Smoke and No Flame?

The claim that hand sanitizer was causing car fires first gained traction in Brazil in April 2020 via social media posts on WhatsApp. This spurred the country’s Corpo de Bombeiros de Campo Grande (Campo Grande Fire Department) to issue a warning about the potential dangers of leaving hand sanitizer in a hot car. However, the fire department admitted that it had yet to see any fires caused in such a manner. Likewise, we have yet to uncover any confirmed reports about hand sanitizer causing a fire while left in a parked car on a hot day.

However, many hand sanitizers are still flammable and do pose some risks. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should not be used near open flames, and people storing large amounts of hand sanitizer should adhere to the National Fire Protection Association’s Flammable and Combustible Liquids code.

Although keeping a small bottle of hand sanitizer in your car won’t result in spontaneous combustion, cautious drivers may want to store their hand sanitizer (and any other liquids kept in plastic bottles) out of direct sunlight in their glove boxes or center consoles.",2020-05-22 19:03:32

234,...and there it is. ,http://www.boredpanda.com/perfect-kingfisher-dive-photo-wildlife-photography-alan-mcfadyen/,"Alan McFadyen, who has been an avid wildlife photographer since 2009, just captured a perfectly timed photo that he has spent six years trying to get. By his count, it took him 4,200 hours and 720,000 photos to get a perfect shot of a Kingfisher diving straight into the water without a single splash.

“The photo I was going for of the perfect dive, flawlessly straight, with no splash required not only me to be in the right place and get a fortunate shot but also for the bird itself to get it perfect,” McFadyen told The Herald Scotland. “I would often go and take 600 pictures in a session, and not a single one of them be any good. However, looking back on the thousands and thousands of photos I have taken to get this one image, it makes me realize just how much work I have done to get it.”

The common kingfisher is mostly known for his very bright plumage, that is quite atypical for birds living in colder climates. The bird usually lives near bodies of water and catches their prey by diving.

McFadyen, who also runs a wildlife photography side business, was inspired to love nature and wildlife by his grandfather. “I remember my grandfather taking me to see the kingfisher nest, and I remember being completely blown away by how magnificent the birds are. So when I took up photography, I returned to this same spot to photograph the kingfishers.”

“I never really stopped to think about how long it was taking along the way as I enjoyed doing it but now I look back on it I’m really proud of the picture and the work I put in.”

According to Joanna, giving your home a good deep clean isn't just about sprucing up: The best thing you can do is identify things you don't need anymore and throw them away for good.

""I can't stress this enough—your whole family will feel the benefits of rooms and spaces that can breathe, so before you even start the cleaning, get five trash bags and start filling them with items your family has outgrown or no longer needs,"" wrote Joanna. ""If you don't love it, toss it.""

And how often do you find yourself doing the same now? This is a weird phenomenon, because you'd associate forgetfulness with unfamiliarity — and that's definitely not something you could accuse mothers of.

But misnaming isn't a result of poor memory, frazzled mom syndrome, the two people looking alike, the similarity of the names that are confused and misused, or even because they're straight up not that important to you.

This content is imported from Giphy. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

Sorry, Ron Swanson. You're way off base here.

Misnaming is actually a sign of love. Calling someone you're close to by the name of someone else you're close to is actually a sign that you care for them dearly, according to an investigation published in the journalMemory & Cognition.

The researchers (all current or former members of the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University) conducted five studies and spoke with over 1,700 participants to examine the so-called ""misnaming phenomenon"" among familiar individuals. They reached their conclusion after observing that misnaming typically happens ""within a social group."" With moms, this means that they typically call their child by their sibling's name – not the name of a random kid down the block who sorta looks like them, or someone they saw on TV.

This is thanks to the way our minds store people's names and information about them, according to the report. The brain uses a ""semantic network"" (essentially, a filing system) where similar or related information is stored ""next to"" each other. So when your brain is looking for your firstborn Tommy's name so you can holler at him to put away his laundry, it might accidentally pull the wrong ""file"" from the ""family folder"" and out comes your other son Joey's name.

Of course, this phenomenon isn't exclusive to parents. The researchers even cite one of the most infamous pop culture examples of misnaming – Ross saying Rachel instead of Emily during his wedding vows in Friends.

So don't worry, your #mombrain is failing you if you can't keep your kids' or friends' names straight. ""It's a normal cognitive glitch,"" researcher Samantha Deffler assured NPR during a January interview about the study. Deffler, too, reported that her own mother used to mess up her siblings' names – with even the family dog's name thrown in. Gotta love those fur babies.

When you open a fashion brand's catalog or shop for a new dress online, you probably assume that the models wearing the clothes don't look like that in real life. Photoshop is everywhere in fashion (and sometimes it's rather egregious), but did you know that the images you see in furniture catalogs might also not be what they seem?

Recently, IKEA revealed that 75% of the photos in its catalog are actually CGI, meaning they've been produced not on a set with real furniture, but at a desk on a computer.

At first hearing this, we couldn't believe all those cozy, well-designed rooms didn't really exist. But IKEA says that producing their catalog digitally is more efficient and eco-friendly, as they don't have to build sets and transport furniture that would ultimately be discarded.

""The most expensive and complicated things we have to create and shoot are kitchens,"" Martin Enthed, an IKEA IT manager, told CG Society. ""From both an environmental and time point of view, we don't want to have to ship in all those white-goods from everywhere, shoot them and then ship them all back again. And unfortunately, kitchens are one of those rooms that differ very much depending on where you are in the world. A kitchen in the US will look very different to a kitchen in Japan, for example, or in Germany. So you need lots of different layouts in order to localise the kitchen area in brochures.""

But wary consumers need not get up in arms. Enthed also stresses that he knows it's important for shoppers to know exactly what they're getting when they buy furniture, so his team takes painstaking steps to mimic the real-life product as best they can.

240,PCOS (Polycycstic Ovarian Syndrome). There is no one symptom which is a direct indication of it. #stopclickbait,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-facts,"Usually the script is simple when you’re sick: You feel crummy. You go to the doctor. A test reveals the issue at hand. But that’s not the sitch with all health conditions. Case in point: polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

While PCOS is classically associated with irregular cycles or missed periods, it’s also easy to miss: Maybe you blame your crazy cycle on other factors. Or, because PCOS is categorized by a slew of signs and symptoms (and isn’t diagnosed by one test), it might even go unnoticed. In fact, less than 50 percent of women with PCOS know they have it, according the PCOS Foundation. But it’s actually a fairly common ovulation issue. Between five and 10 percent of menstruating young women have it, says Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine. Here’s what you need to know about the disorder:

There’s a Group of Symptoms

Just like there's no one test to diagnose PCOS, there’s no one symptom that signifies its presence. Irregular or absent periods can be a sign. Acne, excessive hair (a.k.a. hirsutism, which is when you develop hair in so-called male pattern areas), infertility, and weight gain are also all linked with PCOS, says Mamta Mamik, M.D., an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive science at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. So are metabolic issues like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and even diabetes.

If any of this sounds familiar, check in with your gynecologist, suggests Minkin. Many times, docs will order blood tests to look for wonky levels of sex hormones, like too much testosterone, she says. Your ovaries and adrenal glands make testosterone normally, but if you have PCOS, you make increased amounts. You might also have abnormal glucose levels, she says.

...But Cysts Aren’t Everything

Despite its name, not all women with PCOS have cysts on their ovaries, says Mamik. If you do have cysts, they’re often described as a string of pearls—and if they burst, it can be super-painful. The cysts are sometimes a result of a woman's eggs not being released over time, and can be ID'd through an ultrasound.

It’s a Weighty Matter

PCOS may be genetic, says Mamik. Some research suggests if your mom has it, there’s a 50 percent chance you could, too. But the condition is also associated with being overweight, says Minkin. “One of the conundrums is whether or not you develop PCOS and then gain weight or gain weight and then develop PCOS,” she says. “Probably, both can happen.” If you do have PCOS and are overweight, a weight loss plan (good nutrition and an exercise program) is vital, says Minkin. “Weight loss really helps to normalize the abnormalities,” she says.

Treatment Options Vary

Here’s the good news: “In general, the treatment is quite straightforward,” says Minkin. Beyond addressing any underlying conditions like blood sugar abnormalities or diabetes, your course of action generally depends on where you are in life. If you’re not trying to get pregnant, the easiest remedy is usually the Pill. Oral contraception takes control of your ovaries, forcing them to stop making excess testosterone and controls your periods, says Minkin.

See a baby in the near future? While PCOS can be linked with trouble conceiving, it doesn't mean you’ll never be able to get knocked up, says Mamik. A gynecologist can start you on a medication called Clomid, which gets you ovulating. “Success rates are quite high,” says Minkin. Ultimately, everyone is different, and your ob-gyn can help you come up with the best plan for you based on your medical history and condition.

241,"The ages which end a decade - 29, 39, 49, with 39 being the largest offending age. #stopclickbait",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-are-people-more-likely-to-cheat-at-age-29_us_57a9f9e6e4b0ba7ed23d87a7,"WANDER WOMEN COLLECTIVE via Getty Images There is some research to suggest that, in general, people behave differently when they approach a new decade in their age.

The idea that the person you love is betraying your trust and engaging in intimate rendezvous with someone else is emotionally devastating. It’s only natural to look for patterns and warning signs to avoid being cheated on.

Now, a new report suggests that people are twice as likely to cheat at the “danger age” of 39, and are also more likely to have affairs during the last years of other decades — for example, at age 29 or 49 — than at other times. The findings come from research done by the U.K.-based website IllicitEncounters.com, and were first reported by The Sun.

Do other studies of infidelity back up this claim?

There is some research to suggest that, in general, people behave differently when they approach a new decade in their age. In 2014, researchers Adam L. Alter and Hal E. Hershfield at New York University and the University of California, Los Angeles, respectively, performed six studies to investigate the behaviors of adults during their “9-ending ages” (ages 29, 39, 49, etc.), including their propensity for extramarital affairs. The researchers obtained data from an online dating site similar to Illicit Encounters, where users are already in supposedly monogamous relationships. [I Don’t: 5 Myths About Marriage]

Alter and Hershfield calculated the total number of male users on the site (8,077,820) and compared that to the number of 9-ender male users (952,176). They found there were 18 percent more 9-enders registered than there would be if the site’s users represented a completely random sample of ages.

Across the six studies, Alter and Hershfield also found that 9-enders reported being particularly preoccupied with aging, and were more likely to wonder whether their lives were meaningful.

This could lead to a rise in behaviors that “suggest a search for, or a crisis of meaning,” such as an affair, the researchers said.

In general, infidelity is difficult to study because it’s challenging for researchers to find willing participants and to gather accurate reports, and cheating itself is defined inconsistently across relationships, said Christin Munsch, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut, who was not affiliated with the Illicit Encounters research but does study infidelity.

The Illicit Encounters’ research may not be unbiased: the company is financially backing the study, methods were not vetted by outside experts, and it was not peer-reviewed.

Munsch said that the findings of the Illicit Encounters study could just suggest that people looking to have affairs might not be honest about their age in their profiles. [How Do I Love Thee? Experts Count 8 Ways]

However, in their research, Alter and Hershfield looked at how people on dating sites might approach lying about their age. They asked users to imagine they were trying to fool a potential date into believing they were as young as possible while remaining within the bounds of plausibility. Their data suggested that the most frequent responses were ages ending in 5.

While these aren’t definitive findings, they suggest that a lying 30-year-old is more likely to say they’re 25 than 29.

In her own research, Munsch looked at data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), an anonymous, nationally representative survey of people born between 1980 and 1984 that was conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor. She compared people’s marital status with their responses to questions about whether they had multiple sex partners in the past year, and whether they had had sex with a stranger. Anyone who was married and answered yes to these questions was coded as unfaithful.

She found that for both men and women, being economically dependent (making less money than your spouse) was correlated to increased rates of cheating.

“The less money you make relative to your spouse, the more likely you are to cheat. We compare ourselves: you don’t want to see yourself coming out on the losing end,” Munsch told Live Science.

In 2012, Munsch reviewed the literature for trends surrounding infidelity. With regards to age, she found that as people get older they are more likely to cheat, and that may be because there are simply more opportunities to be unfaithful.

Munsch said that for men, being economically dependent may be worse because they may feel expected by society to be breadwinners. Cheating can be a way for men to simultaneously bolster their masculinity and get back at their breadwinner wives. [Busted! 6 Gender Myths in the Bedroom & Beyond]

According to Munsch, the recipe for avoiding an affair is pretty simple.

“From a sociological perspective, one of the biggest predictors of infidelity is opportunity. If I’m trying to lose weight, I don’t keep cookies in the house. The same principle applies here. If you’re looking for a ‘magic bullet,’ don’t be in the situation” where cheating could happen.

And although it’s tempting try to analyze data to predict who will cheat, putting the results in perspective is important, she said. For example, her research showed that the likelihood of infidelity jumps from around 5 percent for men whose wives make equal financial contributions to 15 percent for men who are economically dependent on their wives.

“That’s three times more likely. But 85 percent of men [who are dependent on their wives] aren’t cheating,” she said.

Ultimately, many variables factor into infidelity. Munsch said that there are certain psychological traits that are correlated to cheating, such as extreme risk-taking behavior or low morality, and that people’s environment also plays a role. If a person with certain traits gets placed in a situation of high opportunity, that can be a good indicator that infidelity will take place.

But by the same token, a person with all the necessary predispositions can be put in an ideal circumstance to cheat and still not do it.

Munsch said that the “9-ending ages” theory is “certainly plausible,” but that predicting any complex human behaviorremains an inexact science.

242,Atopic dermatitis is a form of eczema which affects babies and can cause complications later in life such as sleep problems and allergies. Moisturizing babies with Vaseline would (likely) solve the problem. #stopclickbait,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vaseline-cheap-eczema-prevention_us_584afad3e4b04c8e2bafb25b,"On the surface, eczema may seem like an ailment that is more annoying than debilitating. But for the more than 20 percent of kids who struggle with it, the effects can be more severe ― and costly (really costly) for their parents.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common form of eczema, and tends to develop in infants. It can be either lifelong and chronic or go away on its own over time, and is linked to hay fever, asthma, allergies, sleep problems and weight problems. Data suggests families caring for a child with this type of eczema spend as much as 35 percent of their discretionary income on care each month. Estimates put the total cost of eczema care in the U.S. at up to $3.8 billion per year.

Now, new research suggests that a solution under $10 might be able to help prevent the condition from developing in the first place. The fix? Moisturizing newborns with petroleum jelly until they are six months old.

“We could really save a lot of newborns ― and save families ― a lot of suffering,” researcher Dr. Steve Xu, a resident physician in the department of dermatology at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, told The Huffington Post.

“It’s also a pretty good deal in terms of cost,” he said.

Xu and his team built on a 2014 study of 124 babies, in which researchers from Oregon Health & Science University found that parents cut their newborns’ risk of atopic dermatitis in half when they moisturized them daily (or at least 5 times a week, everywhere but the scalp) for their first six months of life. The parents in the study used either an over-the-counter drugstore ointment, moisturizing cream or sunflower seed oil, all of which provided a similar benefit in terms of preventing eczema.

In a follow up analysis of the research, Xu and his colleagues looked at cost and determined that using a daily moisturizer for a baby’s first six months was cheap ― way cheaper than the costs of dealing with eczema if it develops later on.

A six-month supply of Vaseline petroleum jelly was just $7.30, the cheapest of all the moisturizers in the analysis. And the total cost for the most expensive moisturizer, Vaniply ointment, was $173.39 for a six-month supply.

“We added the economic argument why prophylactic moisturizing is a really really great idea,” Xu said.

There are still a lot of unanswered questions about eczema

Moisturizers are a big part of the way eczema is treated, but until now they haven’t necessarily been used to prevent the problem. The evidence is still unclear as to how they actually help thwart the condition ― in a big part because the evidence is still unclear about what exactly causes atopic dermatitis in the first place ― and why individuals who have it are so likely to go on to develop allergies, hay fever and asthma.

The researchers suspect using moisturizers during infancy helps correct outer-layer skin defects in babies who will go on to develop eczema. Those defects are thought to play a role in how the condition actually develops, along with hereditary and environmental factors, too.

Whether or not preventing eczema would also prevent the allergies, hay fever and asthma that come along with it is yet another unsolved question. But there’s a growing body of data that suggests that atopic dermatitis does in fact makes individuals more susceptible these comorbidities, which some doctors refer to as the “atopic march.”

Vaseline petroleum jelly is one of the moisturizers recommended for the treatment of eczema by the National Eczema Association, though not as a prophylactic treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends petroleum jelly as one of the top choice moisturizers for treating (not necessarily preventing) eczema, including atopic dermatitis, because it’s among the most moisturizing.

Plus, it’s safe, Xu said. Petroleum jelly is fragrance-free and doesn’t have preservatives or additives that could potentially cause irritation or other allergies, he added. That said, some people may still avoid it for political or environmental reasons: Petroleum jelly is actually a byproduct of the oil refining process.

Sunflower seed oil was the second cheapest moisturizer in the study, costing $18.25 for six months of using it daily on a newborn, and may be a solid choice for those who want to avoid petroleum jelly.

Not all infants need a daily moisturizer

Ready to slather your infant with Vaseline tonight? Not without talking to your pediatrician first, Xu said.

It’s important to note that the initial study only included babies who were already considered high-risk of developing atopic dermatitis: They each had a parent or sibling who had at some point been diagnosed with eczema, asthma or hay fever.

Larger studies with longer follow-up are still needed ― and are currently ongoing ― to confirm that the method continues to prevent atopic dermatitis in babies who were moisturized beyond the first six months of their lives. But at this point, the data is encouraging, since nearly half of all individuals who develop eczema do so in the first year of their lives, Xu said.

So far, the research only suggests that using a daily moisturizer on newborns could be a good idea for babies at high risk. The risk of trying this intervention is low, even if it ultimately doesn’t prevent atopic dermatitis.

“Gentle, bland moisturizers have very little to no risk of harm to newborns,” Xu said, adding it’s definitely reasonable for parents with infants who are at high risk of developing atopic dermatitis to ask their pediatricians about using a moisturizer as a preventative measure.

243,The clothes go through a cycle: 1 - Goodwill Store. 2 - Goodwill outlet. 3 - Auction. 4 - Textile Recycler. #stopclickbait,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-does-goodwill-do-with-your-clothes_us_57e06b96e4b0071a6e092352,"Education Images via Getty Images

Giving away used clothes may sound simple: You drop them off at a donation center, and then they’re sold to somebody who can re-use them. Right?

Not quite. In reality, donated clothing often takes a much longer journey before meeting its ultimate fate. In the end, it may get re-sold. But it also may end up in the trash, joining the approximately 12.8 million tons of American textile waste that was sent to landfills during 2013. And that benefits no one.

Goodwill is one of the biggest U.S. landing points for donated clothes: Stores in New York and New Jersey alone collected more than 85.7 million pounds of textile donations last year, Jose Medellin, director of communications for Goodwill NY/NJ, told HuffPost. And his Goodwill region is just one of 164 regional Goodwill organizations across the U.S. and Canada.

As you’re probably starting to realize, it takes a ton of effort to guide your clothes from the Goodwill donation bin to their final resting place. Knowing how Goodwill works can help you make smarter decisions when deciding if another jeans purchase is really worth it for you, for the donations staff and for the environment.

Step 1: The Goodwill retail store

Goodwill operates more than 3,200 individual stores, Kyle Stewart, director of donated goods retail, told HuffPost. When you donate a bag of clothing at a store, workers most likely parse through it to determine what can be sold and what can’t: Wet or mildew-y clothes are eliminated, but everything else is fair game.

Ray Tellez, the vice president of retail operations for Goodwill Southern California, said stores in his region track how long each piece of clothing has been on the retail floor. If an item doesn’t sell within four weeks, it’s sent onward in the process.

Step 2: A Goodwill outlet

At these stores, “the goal is to liquidate,” he told HuffPost. “We want to try and keep as much out of the landfill as possible.”

Each regional Goodwill organization may go about this process slightly differently. You can contact your regional Goodwill headquarters to learn more.

Step 3: Auction

Whatever isn’t sold in outlets moves on to Goodwill auctions, live events where attendees bid on bins of donated items without knowing precisely what’s inside. An auction bin might sell for as low as $35, which is a stellar value, according to Tellez.

Step 4: Textile Recyclers

Then comes the big move: If clothes weren’t able to sell in those first three stages of the process, Goodwill sends them to textile recycling organizations, Stewart said.

S.M.A.R.T., for example, is a trade association whose independent member businesses work to recycle textiles. On average, 45 percent of clothing that makes it to S.M.A.R.T. is either re-sold into the U.S. used clothing industry or sent overseas into markets with more demand, spokesperson Kathy Walsh told HuffPost.

But this isn’t necessarily a good thing. Obviously, re-selling clothes into the U.S. secondhand market just encourages them to make the cycle all over again. And sending clothes overseas can majorly hinder the textile industries in developing countries, robbing locals of jobs and income.

Beyond that, 30 percent of donated clothes at S.M.A.R.T. get cut into rags for industrial use, and 20 percent is processed into a soft fiber filling for furniture, home insulation, car sound-proofing and more.

But what about landfills?

If S.M.A.R.T. recyclers find clothes that are wet, moldy or contaminated, they send them to landfills, Walsh said. The amount they send is small ― just five percent of all donations ― but it all adds up to the ridiculous amount of clothing waste in landfills nationwide.

According to Walsh, nearly 95 percent of all clothing waste could be reused and recycled. We just aren’t disposing of it properly.

For starters, you should never, ever throw your clothes in the garbage, Medellin says. Instead, take them to a Goodwill or other donation center. If they’re wet, moldy or otherwise hazardous, then contact your city’s sanitation department and ask how best to dispose of them.

Of course, the easiest way to prevent clothing waste is to avoid buying clothes you don’t need. Keep a clean closet, and a cleaner planet will be waiting for you later.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this post stated that Americans sent 12 million pounds of textile waste to landfills in 2013. In fact, the number is much higher, at approximately 12.8 million tons.

Anyone that has worn a button-front shirt has likely noticed that the buttons are different, depending on whether it’s a men or women’s shirt. Chances are you haven’t given it much thought, but as it turns out, there’s actually a pretty interesting story that explains why.

Today co-hosts Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie got to the bottom of things during the show’s “What’s Trending” segment Thursday. As it turns out, the different styles date all the way back to when buttons were invented, around the 13th century.

“Only wealthy women could afford to have buttons on their shirts, and if you were wealthy, you also had ladies maids. So having the buttons on the other side made sense, because it was someone else buttoning your clothes.”

If like myself you’re forever forgetting friends and families birthdays then we’ve got a hot tip for you, make a note of September 16.

Why? Well according to Harvard University September 16 is the most common birthday in the world, so if you’ve got that in the diary chances are you’ll be remembering someone’s birthday.

Advert 10

In fact according to FamousBirthdays.com you’ll be celebrating the birth of Nick Jonas, BB King, Amy Poehler and Flor Rida amongst many, many others. Who knows it may also be a friend’s birthday?

To work this out scientists made a graph, called a heat map, which corresponded to the number of births on any given day with light and dark squares.

The graph then shows how birthdays rank against each other, with darker sections being more common and lighter being rarer.

Advert 10

The reason for this is that unsurprisingly birth rates in the summer and autumn tend to be more popular for births, while people seem to conceive children in the winter, presumably to keep warm.

Meanwhile a separate study from back in 2013 which examined 6,500 sperm samples found that male fertility increases in the winter and spring months which again leads to a higher summer birth rate.

Interestingly birthday’s become quite rare from the Christmas time until January 1. Of course February 29 is rare as well because it only comes around every 4 years.

246,"Dishes can break easily, and the sinks show a lot of dirt and scratches. #stopclickbait",http://www.countryliving.com/home-design/a40747/farmhouse-sinks-problems/,"Every country homeowner knows that no kitchen is complete without a farmhouse sink. They're both rustic and elegant, they provide plenty of room for washing dishes, and they're a Joanna Gaines must-have. But before you run off to install one, take note that they do come with a few complications.

Brittany Bailey, a North Carolina homeowner and the DIY guru behind the blog Pretty Handy Girl, is here to share the biggest problems she's experienced with her farmhouse sink, and her valid points are all factors to consider before getting one of your own. Here are both the problems (and the solutions!) you should know about.

1. You should expect some broken dishware. While accidents are bound to happen in any kitchen, you should anticipate a few more broken dishes than usual if you have a farmhouse sink, especially if it's made from cast iron, according to Brittany. They're designed to be extra durable and tough, which means they aren't very forgiving if you drop a glass or plate. The best solution for this is to invest in higher quality, ""break-resist"" dishes and glasses to avoid as many accidents as possible—or to simply be more cautious with your favorite pieces.

2. White sinks show much more dirt. While other sinks tend to mask grime and wear-and-tear, a white farmhouse sink is going to show it all. Be prepared to clean it more often, and opt for baking soda, which should make it look new again.

3. Scratches will be more noticeable too. If you love cooking with cast iron pans, then you should be even more cautious about this possible problem, Brittany writes. Over time, she's figured out the best way to clean up these scratch marks, which she shares onher blog. You can also opt for a sink grid to keep pots, pans, and other dirty items away from the bottom of your sink.

247,Toast the oats in butter before hand. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a39877/how-make-oatmeal-taste-better-toast-butter/,"No one wakes up in the morning craving oatmeal. You deal with the pile of mush when you're trying to be healthy. Breakfast doesn't have to be this sad. One quick and easy step will seriously change the way you think about oats.

Toast the oats in butter! It's a trick I picked up from the cookbook Whole Grain Mornings . While Megan, the author, has oatmeal down to a science, you don't need a recipe.

Melt a tab of butter in a small saucepan, then throw in the oats. The magic ratio is one tablespoon butter to one cup oats—steel cut or old-fashioned. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the oats smell nutty and roasted. Once you hit that point, set the oats aside and proceed as normal. Bring the milk or water (or a mixture of both) to a simmer, add the oats and cook to your liking.

The world of difference one tablespoon of butter makes is incredible. It makes oatmeal actually taste rich and decadent. You won't even need brown sugar or sweetener! It's amazing on its own.

Try it with these super-delish oatmeal recipes:

248,Clothes & Tide Pods. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/shopping/a38784/dollar-store-manager/,"There seems to be an endless amount of curiosity surrounding dollar stores. And we get it—dollar stores are full of tremendous discounts you can't find anywhere else and helpful organization items (and yes, also some toxic products that scarred the bejeebers out of us!). But honestly, we've always wanted to know more. Like how is it possible to sell all those items so cheaply? And is that bargain-priced food actually safe to eat?

Well thanks to Brandon, a somewhat-secretive Dollar General manager and his recent Reddit post—where he did an ""ask me anything"" Q&A—we now know even more about the popular chains. Here's what we found most interesting about his insider information:

1. Dollar stores don't sell items that are faulty or broken—they're discounted for a different reason. ""I assume like any retailer the product is so cheap because it's bought in massive bulk quantities (DG has around 20,000 stores to supply),"" Brandon said. ""To be honest, most of the products that aren't food are made in China, so you can probably guess why it's cheap.""

2. But there's one precaution he recommends when buying food: ""It's always a good habit to check expiration dates in any store,"" he said, ""but you should be A-OK if the store team rotates the food.""

3. Yes, the stores are cheap, but the company is not. ""Normal starting pay for managers is 34-40k and is negotiable to some degree,"" Brandon explained. ""I'm in that range. I know another manager that's been with Dollar General for 15 years and gets paid 80k. Your pay depends on the size of the store you manage, location, and time with the company. You also get bonuses but I split those with my crew.""

4. And the company seems pretty strict. In fact, you can get fired on the spot for something seemingly harmless. When asked if he ever lost his keys, he replied, ""If you lose your keys you get fired instantly, so thankfully no.""

5. The unofficial biggest seller may (or may not) surprise you. ""The biggest steady seller for a single item would have to be cigarettes,"" he said, ""around 600 packs a week sold at my store.""

6. And the most shoplifted items are...odd. ""The two most shoplifted items is a tie between clothes and Tide Pods,"" the manager said. ""People were just slicing open the Tide Pod Pouches and dumping them into a bag. But I've seen a lot of stupid things get stolen like two packs [of] hot cocoa mix out of a box, a few trash bags out of a box, a few Ziploc bags out of a box that were only a dollar to begin with...tons more.""

7. Laundry products are considered the best deals, according to his customers. ""I get told laundry products. Beer is cheap too, same with phone chargers,"" he said when asked what the best dollar store deals are. ""We have iPhone 5 and 6 chargers for $15, while the stores down the street sell them for $30-40. Most of are our products are cheaper than other big box stores apparently (been told this by customers). Greeting cards are a deal. Most are 50¢-$1. If you go to a place like Hallmark they're about five bucks for the same ones.""

8. And other dollar stores aren't the main source of competition. ""Walmart markets are the competition and ever since four of them sprang up around my city, my district hasn't been breaking last year's sales,"" he explained.

249,Spray the top with vegetable oil and then cover it in plastic wrap. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a41502/this-is-how-you-can-stop-wasting-guacamole/,"I was 21 the first time I tried the glorious green dip that is guacamole. And it was only then that I realized I had not been living for those first 21 years of life. I was simply existing. There is no need to debate, discuss, or dispute whether or not guacamole is God's gift to us mere Earthlings.

Anyway, like all great things in the world, the sanctity of guacamole comes at a cost. The stuff lasts only about 2 minutes in the refrigerator until it turns into a mushy brown vat of slime.

But, there is a cure, and you probably already have everything you need to make it work. The next time you make guac, just spray the top with some vegetable oil, coconut oil, or olive oil spray, then cover it in plastic wrap. It should stay green for up to 24 hours, according to PureWow.

Naturally, we had to know how this works—especially before greasing up our guac. Turns out, the spray creates an oxygen barrier around the mashed avocado, which eliminates any oxidation from occurring (the process that makes it turn brown). You could try this trick on sliced avocados too—perfect if you're only using half for a stuffed avocado or avo toast and want to save the other half for later.

This hack's a game changer—though, if you eat the entire bowl of guac in one sitting, you really never have to worry about this problem.

It turns out that these structures aren't just offensive to the eyes.

Unsightly public architecture isn't always simply a product of bad taste — it can also serve as a means of social control and aims to repel local homeless populations, Atlas Obscura reported.

What makes architecture ""hostile""?

Known as hostile, defensive, or disciplinary architecture, these structures are strategically designed to deter homeless people and other groups perceived as undesirable from sleeping or loitering within eyesight of local residents.

""This style of architecture, which makes use of spikes, barricades, protrusions and checkpoints to prevent society’s unwanted from inhabiting public spaces, is not new,"" reporter Allegra Kirkland wrote on Alternet in 2015. ""But its forms are proliferating, and it can now be found in urban centers across the globe, from Tokyo to Copenhagen.""

This is what it looks like.

In 2014, a luxury apartment building in London installed “anti-homeless” spikes in a nearby alcove.

""People living in the flats, which sell for upwards of £800,000, said the metal studs were installed two weeks ago after a number of homeless people were seen sleeping there,"" the Telegraph reported in June 2014.

The spikes led to major backlash on social media, and they were ultimately removed.

Hostile architecture isn't always easy to spot.

Hostile architecture also pops up in more subtle forms — like public benches.

Often, defensive architecture is said to be installed for security purposes, but our definitions of safe and secure housing are colored by the stigma and criminalization of homelessness. ""This style of design cannot be untethered from broader anti-vagrancy efforts, particularly in the United States,"" Alternet reported.

""We see these measures all the time within our urban environments, whether in London or Tokyo, but we fail to process their true intent,"" writer Alex Andreou wrote on the Guardian. ""I hardly noticed them before I became homeless in 2009.""

""It was only then that I started scanning my surroundings with the distinct purpose of finding shelter and the city’s barbed cruelty became clear,"" he continued.

Andreou described what happened when he discovered an old wooden bench had been replaced with a more hostile design:

""An old, wooden bench, made concave and smooth by thousands of buttocks, underneath a sycamore with foliage so thick that only the most persistent rain could penetrate it. Sheltered and warm, perched as it was against a wall behind which a generator of some sort radiated heat, this was prime property. Then, one morning, it was gone. In its place stood a convex metal perch, with three solid armrests. I felt such loss that day.""

Not all hostile architecture is ugly, either. It can even come in the form of a pretty plant, placed somewhere homeless people might otherwise sleep or rest.

""Hostile design comes in even more innocuous, and sometimes even lovely forms,"" Atlas Obscura pointed out. ""Take the humble potted plant. What could be hostile about a leafy ficus in a pretty pot? Nothing—until you consider where it's placed.""

Hostile architecture attempts to conceal poverty and homelessness, which are already criminalized in many U.S. cities.

There are already many laws that criminalize homelessness in the U.S., as Alternet activism editor Alyssa Figueroa pointed out in a February 2015 piece. These laws restrict homeless individuals from activities like resting, begging, sharing food, and urinating in public.

""Hostile architecture facilitates the work of law enforcement by making it physically impossible for the homeless to inhabit public spaces,"" Kirkland observed on Alternet. ""Neither approach actually addresses the root causes of homelessness, but instead shoves it out of sight.""

The possibility of spazzing out after reading this is very likely, but it’s super important so here goes: There’s a really scary reason you should avoid charging your phone in public. Not only can your charging habits kill your phone battery, but they also place you at risk of becoming the next victim of hacking, specifically if you connect your phone to a compromised charging port exposes your personal info to hackers, Cosmo reports.

According to CNN, this particular form of technological thievery is referred to as “juice jacking,” and basically works the same way as when you use a USB cord to download images from your phone to your computer. Unfortunately, there’s no way to tell if a public port has been hacked, so the best way to avoid exposing all of your pertinent info (including emails, text messages and contacts) is to stop charging your phones in public.

Or you could completely snap and destroy your cell phone because, srsly, how frustrating is this?!

So making sure your phone is fully charged before you leave the house is a huge hassle, and honestly feels like an impossible feat, but since there are selfies and Snapchats to be shared, going the extra step to protect yourself is totally worth it.

But there’s one thing that Too Faced delivered on that Kylie left out — and people are pissed. Here’s why: While Too Faced’s iteration famously smells of actual peaches, Kylie’s does not.

261,They *might* increase their membership costs $5-$10. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/life/a41225/costco-membership-price-hike/,"Buying in bulk can reap all kinds of rewards, like not having to buy paper towels for two months, or saving big on that 48-ounce box of crackers for your wine and cheese night. But if you're a member of Costco, you might have to prepare to shell out extra cash for those benefits.

The megastore is apparently planning to charge more for its memberships. Analysts at UBS bank expect the hike to be as much as 10 percent. That means the basic Gold Star Membership annual fee would jump up $5, from $55 a year to $60, and the Executive Membership would increase from $110 to $120.

Costco hasn't officially confirmed that this is happening, but the company's chief financial officer Richard Galanti said during a conference call last month that the time is probably right for a price increase, Consmerist reports. This could be in part to help the chain expand, as it has 30 new stores slated to open this year, about half of which will be the U.S.

If you are thinking about dropping your membership now, remember that you can still (sort of) shop there without one.

262,"It's made of silicone, so it doesn't absorb (or waste) as much product as a regular makeup sponge. It's also easier to clean. #stopclickbait",http://www.thisisinsider.com/what-is-the-silisponge-beauty-blender-2016-12,"The INSIDER Summary:

• There's a new silicone makeup sponge.

• It's called the Silisponge.

• People are excited about it because it's easy to clean and doesn't require as much product.

• It's currently sold out.



Every week when I'm cleaning my makeup sponge, I look down and think there has to be an easier way to do this.

Well, now there is.

Molly Cosmetics has recreated the classic beauty sponge in a big way. They made it out of silicone. Stay with me here, because it's actually pretty awesome. The best part is that you won't break the bank trying it out. The Silisponge is super affordable, but only if you can get your hands on one.

Makeup sponges are nothing new — until now, that is. In case you haven't seen the latest beauty innovation, let me break it down for you. According to the company's Instagram, the Silisponge works the same way that your typical makeup sponge would. It applies foundation, blush or bronzer to the skin. The only difference is that it saves you a whole lot of product while it does it. Because it's silicone, no makeup soaks into the sponge. It's also a heck of a lot easier to clean.

And as if all of that wasn't already enough. The Silisponge is also super affordable as well. As of now, the sixth restock has already sold out, but the products are selling $9.90 for one or $14.90 for two. That's pretty darn affordable, if you ask me. It comes as no surprise that the products are constantly selling out at this price.

Not to mention you'll be able to use these forever. Since it's so easy to clean and you don't have to worry about makeup being trapped inside, odds are you'll only have to buy one your entire beauty career. On top of saving money on foundation, this product seems to be an all-around money-saver.

SiliSponge blending on my 39 y.o. skin.... 😉 #silisponge #clearsponge #blending #beautyblender #mollycosmetics A video posted by M O L L Y C O S M E T I C S (@mollycosmetics) on Nov 26, 2016 at 10:56pm PST Nov 26, 2016 at 10:56pm PST

The only problem with the beauty tool is trying to get your hands on one. It's currently sold out of their sixth restock, which is pretty darn amazing, if you ask me. Molly Cosmetics shows no sign of slowing down on production though, so odds are there will be plenty more restocks to come.

I don't know about you, but I'm dying to try this out! If you want to be one of the first ones to snag the seventh restock, you can sign up for emails on the company's site. That's probably your best bet to getting this wonder product!",2017-01-20 10:19:50
263,It's meant to keep hot food warm. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a41351/heres-what-that-drawer-underneath-your-oven-is-actually-for/,"If you're like us, you probably use that big drawer underneath your stove to hoard cookie sheets, muffin tins, and bulky skillets.

But regardless of what you put in it, we bet you aren't using that space for its intended purpose: a warming drawer.

Yep, that's right. It sounds crazy that appliance manufacturers expect us to let such a large potential storage space sit empty, but on some oven models, it's designed to be a spot to keep your food warm.

If you're skeptical, just dig up your oven's owner's manual. You may find a description like this: ""The warming drawer is designed to keep hot foods at serving temperature. Always start with hot food. Cold or room-temperature foods cannot be heated, warmed, or cooked in the warming drawer.""

This news may or may not come as a surprise to you, but if you think you'd miss the extra storage space, we have a solution. Continue storing your extra pots and pans in the drawer—and then just empty it to keep dinner warm when your guests are running late. Win-win!

264,Lactaid. ,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/best-eggnog_us_5852a245e4b016e9c118a1e8,"Mizina via Getty Images

Alton Brown best described eggnog when he remarked that it is almost identical to ice cream. It is technically just a stirred custard made of milk and egg, after all.

No one really knows why eggnog has become the iconic holiday drink. Most believe we have 18th century American colonials to thank ― the most famous supporter being George Washington, whose recipe for a very boozy homemade nog is still used today. The origins of nog are murky, though culinary historians can agree that it is related to posset, an early British medieval drink made of warm milk and ale.

One thing we do know that you have to drink some over the holidays. Adventurous folks might make a batch from scratch ― we applaud you ― but most eggnog imbibers will just pick up a carton at the grocery store. There are more than enough options out there, which made us realize: we have no idea who makes the best eggnog.

We quickly remedied that with a taste test. Eight discerning eggnog lovers tasted blindly tasted 10 different nogs in a quest to find the best store-bought brand. We tried classic versions, one fancy local version ― as a control ― and all kinds of milk alternative nogs. The most-loved eggnog, the winner of the taste test, came as a shock to us all.

Below are the results. Each nog was rated on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest score. (As always with HuffPost taste tests, we were in no way sponsored by any of the brands below.)",2017-01-08 11:21:01

While most of us like a side of pancakes with our eggs, what we should have been eating all along is some pancakes in our eggs. Or, more specifically, pancake batter mixed in with our eggs before they’re cooked up into omelets. This is what IHOP does with their omelets, and it’s why their recipe turns out so fluffy.

The folks at Extra Crispy have recreated IHOP’s omelet recipe in the video above. Pancake batter not only adds fluff to omelets, it adds heft too ― plus, a touch of sweetness.

Don’t be fooled, this recipe is no delicate, custardy French omelet. It will never be used as the test of a great chef. But, it’s tasty. And it’s something we could all use come Saturday morning.",2017-01-06 09:18:00

By Jeff Forte

Change always happens one thing at a time.

Even when I knew this was true, it was still hard for me to do because it seemed like so much was wrong with my marriage that none of the common marriage advice could fix it.

I was walking on eggshells around my wife, trying to avoid another disagreement. They were happening far too often. It seemed like we couldn’t see eye to eye on anything, and both of us were getting more stressed out day by day.

I knew I wanted to live happily ever after, I just didn’t know how to make it happen.

I also knew for sure that our marriage wasn’t going to survive much more of this. It seemed like there were so many aspects of our marriage that needed to be fixed, and I didn’t know where to start.

Advertisement

Then a thought occurred to me ... I could at least do one thing.

But which one thing? Where would I start?

When I thought about everything that was wrong in my marriage I realized that none of it was going to change unless my wife and I could talk to each other without arguing.

How was that going to happen?

Advertisement

I realized that the only way we would even want to talk with one another would be if we felt closer to each other.

So I decided that what I needed to do was to work on improving the feelings of closeness between us.

That was it!

All I did every day was to work on bringing us closer together. I focused on affection, connection, and feelings of togetherness.

You could do that too. It worked wonders for me.

That’s the one thing, and the only thing, that gave all of our other issues a chance to be resolved. By putting everything else that wasn’t working in our relationship on hold, we both had a chance to breathe.

When I put everything outside of feeling connected to each other on hold, it took the pressure off of us. And the stress went away.

If I hadn’t done that, and instead had continued to try to address all of our problems at once, we might have divorced.

I know personally that love isn’t always easy.

It can be hard when you are feeling bitter or resentful. It can be difficult when you feel unloved by your partner. It can even be painful if your feelings of affection get rejected.

Advertisement

But you could also do one thing.

You could focus on the feelings of togetherness, creating a better connection, and demonstrating affection for each other. You could do any of those things.

People also need to know how to resolve their conflicts and improve intimacy and communication. We are either growing in love with our partner — or losing love. We are either feeling more deeply connected or less. And those are all things you can do something about.

Will you?

Everyone needs to know how to bring love back into their lives. If you are interested in getting Jeff's thoughts on how to repair your marriage, reach out to him here.

Nicole, 32, doesn’t have one-night stands. She has half-night stands. After sex, she heads back home and wakes up in her own bed.

Her hookup buddy doesn’t mind, because he, too, prefers half-night stands.

“We enjoy our time together but when it’s over, it’s over,” Nicole, who works as a writer and project manager in Dallas, Texas, told The Huffington Post. “We both have demanding careers and insanely early mornings. Starting the day in my own bed ― where I can race to my computer at 6 a.m., if necessary ― is just easier for everyone involved.”

Half-night stands are becoming more and more common. They’re essentially an abbreviated version of the one-night stand ― instead of staying the night, one person makes their exit after sex.

“If you don’t want anything more than sex, what’s the point of staying overnight with a stranger?” Bay Area sex therapist Celeste Hirschman told HuffPost. “It’s just easier to go home so you can sleep in your own comfortable bed, wake up, and start your day fresh.”

According to Tammy Nelson, a psychologist and author of The New Monogamy, the half-night stand trend suggests women are simply asserting more sexual agency.

Advertisement

“Women call the shots now,” she told HuffPost. “They choose to go to bed with a man or choose to leave after the sex and go home to their own place. And if they choose to stay, they make that choice. It really is a new time of sexual freedom for women.”

“We live in a ‘swipe’ culture where it's easy to hook up quick and move onto the next encounter.""” - Max DuBowy, a millennial in Portland, Oregon

Of course, no-strings-attached sex is nothing new. But this is no-strings attached sex without the awkward morning after. And naturally, it’s not only women who are hooking up and forgoing small talk the next morning.

Max DuBowy, a 26-year-old gay writer and life coach in Portland, Oregon, leaves early, too, by and large without regrets.

“I think there are two reasons millennials like myself are choosing to cut and run after hooking up,” DuBowy explained to HuffPost. “First, we live in a ‘swipe’ culture where it’s easy to hook up quick and move onto the next encounter. Sex is sort of like ice cream, in that it comes in all kinds of flavors; Some evenings vanilla ice cream tastes good, but other nights, you’re really craving rocky road.”

Advertisement

Plus, DuBowy also believes millennials are smart enough to compartmentalize sex and love.

“Sex is simply an activity. Love is intimate and deeper,” he said. “It’s easier to move on after getting it on since love usually isn’t part of the experience until you’re in a committed relationship.”

But half-night stands are often to the detriment of meaningful human connection.

“When I only wanted to get my jollies off, I felt satisfied and content after a half-night stand,” DuBowy said. “But if I wanted to use sex to get my mind off feeling lonely, I felt lonelier after the hookup.”

“Be sure to tell the person you’re going home with that you can’t spend the night before you actually get to their home.”” - Seth Meyers, a psychologist in Los Angeles

And of course, sometimes there are weird, conflicted feelings after a half-night stand. To text or not to text the next day? Was this one night of passion and nothing more?

As 27-year-old writer Brenda Mejia has discovered firsthand, half-night stands become a lot more complicated when feelings are involved.

“It’s definitely something that can cut both ways,” said Mejia, who blogs about travel and sports at Traveleira.com. “People want their own privacy but you’re still intimating passion and still feel a sense of attachment during that time.”

That’s why people who prefer half-night stands should be transparent with their sexual partners, said Seth Meyers, a psychologist and author of Dr. Seth’s Love Prescription: Overcome Relationship Repetition Syndrome and Find the Love You Deserve.

“Be sure to tell the person you’re going home with that you can’t spend the night before you actually get to their home,” he said. “Or that you have an early morning so you’d prefer they not stay over.”

If they have a heads up “and it feels like the two of you made the decision together, there shouldn’t be awkwardness when it comes time to leave,” Meyers said.",2017-01-04 08:13:00
268,"It’s myoglobin, the protein that delivers oxygen to an animal’s muscles. This protein turns red when meat is cut, or exposed to air. ",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-the-blood-in-steak_us_57fc0219e4b0e655eab6eb36,"While many people love a good rare steak, others (ahem, Donald Trump) have a fear ― or at least concerns ― about eating meat that looks “bloody.” But before you turn down that juicy rare steak, it’s worth taking a moment to learn about why it isn’t going to hurt you.

As it turns out, that “blood” in your steak isn’t blood at all.

Advertisement

It’s myoglobin, the protein that delivers oxygen to an animal’s muscles. This protein turns red when meat is cut, or exposed to air. Heating the protein turns it a darker color. Rare meat isn’t “bloody,” it is just cooked to a lower temperature.

There’s a reason some meats are darker than others.

Myoglobin delivers oxygen to muscle tissues. Animals with more active muscle tissues, as well as older animals, both have meat with more myoglobin, Jeffrey Savell, a distinguished professor of Meat Science at Texas A&M University, told HuffPost.

That’s why veal, which is the meat from a baby calf, is much lighter in color than steak from a full-grown cow ― its muscles haven’t been activated as much as the older cows. It’s also why darker meat is found on turkey legs (where there’s more active muscle tissue) and lighter meat is found in the breasts.

The freshest meat is actually purple.

A fresh-cut slab of cow’s meat is actually purplish in color, Savell says. Exposure to oxygen during the packing process turns it the cherry-red tone we’ve come to associate with freshness.

“This pigment is of major importance, since it represents the bright red color desired by purchasers,” reads “Lawrie’s Meat Science,” one of the tentpole books for students and professionals in the meat industry. Some producers have even gone so far as to treat their meat with carbon dioxide gas in order to lock in this red color far past its normal lifespan.

But brown does NOT mean it’s bad.

Advertisement

After a few days in a grocery store display case, myoglobin molecules naturally oxidize and the meat eventually turns brown, Savell says. It may look less appealing, but it isn’t any less safe to eat.

“Brown meat doesn’t mean it’s bad,” Savell said. “But [grocery stores] will discount it, mark it down. If you buy brown meat, just be sure to cook it right away, because it’s likely already been out there for three or four days.”

Bloomberg via Getty Images

A meat’s color can tell you how it was cooked.

Meat changes color depending on its internal temperature at the time of cooking. According to “Lawrie’s Meat Science,” red meat that reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit during cooking will have a bright red interior, while red meat cooked to 140 to 158 degrees will be pink. Anything hotter than that should turn the meat grayish-brown.

Keep in mind, however, that the U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture recommends cooking steak to an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit and letting it rest for three minutes to kill nasty bacteria that could make you sick.

So if it’s not blood, what’s all that juice?

If you’re cooking fresh meat to rare, then you can expect a lot of red myoglobin to be present. Account for the water that naturally occurs in muscle tissues, and you’ve got a bright-red juice that may look similar to blood, but isn’t at all.

“Meat is about 70 percent water,” Sevell says. “So you have water, and myoglobin, and other pigments that leak out. That’s where this juice comes from. I can assure you it’s not blood.”",2017-01-03 07:12:00

",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/infidelity-sign_us_57c075e1e4b04193420ef97d,"It may seem like there are a hundred complicated reasons why infidelity becomes an issue in so many marriages, but according to preacher and author DeVon Franklin, one big reason is actually quite simple. And it begins, he says, before a wedding even takes place.

As DeVon explains during a conversation with Oprah about relationships, sex and celibacy on “SuperSoul Sunday,” men, in particular, have been conditioned to give in to their sex drive. The result, DeVon says in the interview and in his book, “The Wait,” is typically recklessness and chaos.

“As men, we’re raised in a culture where that type of behavior is almost encouraged and rewarded,” he says. “Sometimes, we find validation as men in that type of behavior, but it’s the same behavior that suffocates and kills us.”

DeVon ― who together with his wife, Meagan Good, chose to remain celibate until their 2012 marriage ― also says that one’s sexual behaviors before marriage are the same behaviors that will exist within the marriage as well.

“If I had no discipline in sex before marriage, I will have no discipline in sex after marriage,” DeVon states simply. “And we wonder why most marriages end and why infidelity is so high.”

Too often, he adds, people assume (or hope) that the words “I do” are some sort of magic spell.

“It’s not like [when] you get married and you say, ‘I do,’ everything I practiced is out the window,” DeVon points out. “No. What you have practiced, what habits you have, they’re still there.”

A pilot has revealed why they dim the cabin lights when taking off and landing – and it’s got nothing to do with making it more dramatic for the passengers.

Yes, it turns out there’s actually a very good reason you can’t read your book during landing and it’s all to do with safety according to one pilot, The Daily Mail reports.

Advert 10

According to Chris Cooke, who flies with a major domestic airline, the procedure is a precautionary measure designed to allow passengers’ eyes to adjust to darkness quickly.

Adrian Pingstone

The human eye takes about ten minutes to adjust to darkness so by dimming the lights valuable time is saved in an emergency.

The idea being that if something goes wrong during the plane’s descent and an emergency evacuation is suddenly necessary it’s vital that people actually be able to see.

Advert 10

He explains:

Imagine being in an unfamiliar bright room filled with obstacles when someone turns off the lights and asks you to exit quickly. Pixabay

Dimming the lights also makes the emergency path-lighting and signs easier to see and helps passengers maintain ‘a basic sense of orientation’.

Chris also went on to add this is the same reason why passengers are asked to leave blinds up during landing as unobstructed windows can bring in natural light if during an emergency the lights suddenly cut out.

The goal is 150 minutes over 7 days. This new study finds that 1 year after starting (and sticking to!) an aerobic exercise regimen, postmenopausal women who worked out twice as much—300 minutes a week—lost more weight and twice as much body fat, plus they dropped more inches from their waists.

The study, published in JAMA Oncology, followed 384 women between the ages of 50 and 74, who at the start of the study were mostly inactive. Their BMIs ranged between 22 and 40. The women were assigned to two groups: One group followed official guidelines by working out 5 days a week, 30 minutes per session, for a total of 150 minutes; the other group exercised 5 days for 60 minutes at a time to reach 300 minutes a week. Any aerobic activity was allowed, as long as it was vigorous—enough for the women to break a sweat, but still be able to carry on a conversation.

[block:bean=sub-offer-betterbody-block]

After 1 year, the women who exercised longer lost nearly twice as much total body fat and more total body weight (3.3% lost versus 2.5%), compared with the women who followed the 150-minute program. Exercising longer also led to lower BMI, less abdominal fat, and slimmer waists—nearly 2.5 inches lost versus less than 2 inches—and all of this was accomplished while the women continued to follow their normal diets.

Doubling the loss in body fat is especially exciting, says study author Christine Friedenreich, PhD, scientific leader of cancer epidemiology and prevention research at Alberta Health Services in Canada. Body fat is a known risk factor for breast cancer and other chronic diseases for this group of women; previous studies have shown that lowering body fat also helps prevent endometrial and colon cancers, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.

""This study provides definitive data on exercising longer to decrease fat levels,"" Friedenreich says. ""Yes, 150 minutes of exercise per week is beneficial, but 300 minutes is better.""

It adds a creamy flavour and helps prevent the bread from burning. ,http://www.simplemost.com/use-instead-butter-make-grilled-cheese-absolutely-heavenly-2016-2/,"No matter how old you get, you’ll never outgrow your love of a grilled cheese sandwich. Because really, there’s nothing better than when bread toasted to perfection and combines with melted cheese, is there? I didn’t think so.

If you thought you couldn’t love grilled cheese more than you already do, get ready to be amazed. This trick for making the perfect grilled cheese sandwich will bring you an entirely newfound appreciation for the food.

So, here’s the thing: Instead of spreading butter on the bread right before dropping it into the skillet, you’re going to spread a layer of mayonnaise.

Not only will this add a little creamy flavor, it will also help your bread toast just the way you like it, without burning. Because we’ve all burned a grilled cheese or two in our day, right? Well, not anymore.

According to PureWow, using mayonnaise will ensure your bread is golden brown because mayonnaise won’t burn as easily as butter. It’s the oil and egg in the condiment that allows for the brown coloring and all of that added flavor.

And Hellman’s must agree. They released a commercial to promote using their mayo to craft the perfect grilled cheese.

Just pull out the mayonnaise and heat up the skillet, the most delicious sandwich of your life is coming right up!

Or, you could skip pulling out the skillet and try something new. Have you heard about people making grilled cheese in their air fryer? It can be done, and some people swear by it.

One of our writers tried several different methods for making grilled cheese with her air fryer — but the traditional way, with butter rather than mayo on the outside of the bread. She came away from the experience with a clear winner: the method that involved using the air fryer’s crisping basket.

276,The boy stood up to sing along to Hakuna Matata. No one said anything to him. ,https://themighty.com/2016/10/going-to-an-autism-friendly-performance-of-the-lion-king-on-broadway/,"Growing up, I was a huge fan of “The Lion King.” Now as an adult, I still love watching the film with my younger cousins and mentees. Then recently, I heard that an autism-friendly performance of “The Lion King” was happening on Broadway! I bought tickets right away and was ready for the nostalgia to begin.

Thanks to the Theatre Development Fund and the Autism Theatre Initiative, every season they have several of these autism-friendly performances for our families to enjoy.

The day of the performance came and I was ecstatic. As the performance began, all the families seemed to be thoroughly enjoying themselves. Right before the end of the first act, the actors were performing the classic song “Hakuna Matata” when I noticed a young boy stand up out of his chair and began to sing along.

There this boy was, flapping his arms and singing, and I was thinking the worst was about to happen. I instantly became concerned for the boy. That any minute, there would be a stranger making a comment in his direction.

But what happened next left me speechless…

Absolutely nothing.

No judgment. No criticism. Just a boy singing “Hakuna Matata” with a big smile on his face.

As the song concluded after the first act ended, and the lights came back on, I noticed a woman next to the boy with tears still running down her eyes. A smile just as big as the boy’s was on her face.

The audience understood that the boy was having an amazing time at the theater.

These are the types of moments that take my breath away.

This was a moment where there was no judgment from anyone around them, just people enjoying something together as a family.

When I was growing up on the autism spectrum, I often struggled with challenges in the theater due to my sensory issues. But even though the loud noises tended to bother me at times, one of my key interests was in theater. I was able to enjoy countless moments of pure joy with my family, and so was this mom with her son.

I cannot thank the Theatre Development Fund and the Autism Theatre Initiative for continuing to make these moments possible for our community. We need more people to lead by their example in their local communities to make all forms of entertainment possible for our loved ones in an autism-friendly setting.

The performance that day was incredible, but for me it was the audience that stole the show. Thank you to our community for making that moment possible.

280,"This article alleges that the cure is to create a paste out of honey, coconut oil, and flour and strap it down to your chest. ",http://shareably.net/honey-wrap-cough-remedy/,"Teen went from being completely healthy to being told she was going to die within two weeks

No one likes the taste of cough syrup in their mouth and having a nasty cough that won’t go away has to be one of the most uncomfortable states of being possible. Coughing, of course, is due not only to irritation in your throat due to allergens, but it is also due to a buildup of mucous in your bronchial tubes which can further lead to bronchitis, chronic cough, and dry heaving in the lungs.

What if I told you that there was a natural alternative to calming these symptoms and that it would cost absolutely nothing to your health to give it a go?! The idea is to create a paste out of honey, coconut oil, and flour. After that, simply strap it to your chest overnight (if you’re an adult) to begin all it to aid in soothing your symptoms!

It is called a “Honey Wrap.”

What exactly is wrong with cough syrup and pharmaceutical options? Codeine and dextromethorphan

Codeine sulfate is what is called an opioid analgesic (a pain reliever) that has a whole slew of common side effects such as: drowsiness, light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, and the list goes on. Of course these can be amplified when taken with other medications which also induce sleep as is common when trying to tackle multiple symptoms such as mucus in the lungs, sinus pressure, and allergy symptoms such as stuffy, runny nose etc.

Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant that is commonly used in over-the counter drugs. This particular drug is used to suppress the signals to your brain that would tell it to spasm your lungs in attempt to purge it from irritants as well as the signals that would come from your throat that would tell your brain to make a powerful cough from your lungs to push the mucus caught in your throat out.

So what can a Honey Wrap do for you? The specifics

The first ingredient of interest in my opinion wouldn’t be honey, but the coconut oil! Coconut oil is high in lauric acid, therefore it is thought to dissolve the lipid coating (lipid means the “fatty” layer which the virus used as protection) around some viruses and thus makes them more susceptible to attack by the immune system!

The partner in crime, honey, has often been used orally to temporarily relieve common cold symptoms such as sore, itchy throat and coughing fits. In this case we are attempting to go straight to the source of the issue, the mucus in your lungs, by applying the mixture topically and allowing it to be absorbed into your system.

Recipe: Honey Wrap (adapted from a recipe by besthealthyguide)

Supplies/Ingredients

Raw organic honey

Coconut oil

Flour

Napkin

Adhesive medical tape

Directions:

Mix a teaspoon of flour with some honey, and then add some warmed coconut oil. Apply to a napkin, and place in the center of your chest with some adhesive medical tape. This all-natural compress can be applied to an adult overnight, or to a child for only 2-3 hours. You should notice some results after the first treatment, but as with all natural treatments time is your friend, and it’s perfectly safe to do multiple treatments over a week.

Give this method a try! Being an all-natural treatment that uses relatively little of the products in question you can be assured of safety and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, if it isn’t for you, you are now aware of some safety information in regards to common cough-related pharmaceuticals!

",https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/this-is-the-worst-lunch-to-eat-in-the-office-according-to-a-new-survey,"Finding an appropriate office lunch is a minefield. The kind of minefield that risks a mortifying, all-office ""Reminder NOT to heat curry in the microwave"" email if executed incorrectly. Obvious no-nos are egg mayonnaise, sloppy burritos, and anything involving fish, but then what about a harmless tuna salad? And if you sit opposite the office veggie, are BLT sandwiches allowed?

A new study conducted by interior landscaping firm Ambius (because, erm, nothing enhances an interior space like anxiously munching coworkers) delves deeper into the precarious world of eating al desko. Surveying 1,000 UK office workers, the firm found that two thirds eat lunch at their desks most days of the week.

And what are these one-handed typers stuffing in their mouths and trying not to spill over their keyboards? Hopefully nothing with too pungent an aroma: Ambius also found that over half of those surveyed branded colleagues who eat smelly food in the office as ""anti-social.""

The most anti-social of these foods were mackerel, sardines, cheese, and eggs. There goes tomorrow's niçoise salad, then.

The survey found that the least offensive lunches were those of tempting buttered toast, pastries, and bacon sandwiches. Commenting on the findings, Gareth Cowmeadow of Ambius said: ""Some people may not realize how much of an effect their lunch choices could have on coworkers who sit near them.""

But what might be even worse than oblivious, pickled onion-chomping coworkers, however, is that Ambius also found that two out of five of office workers simply do not have enough time to take a proper lunch break.",2016-12-16 07:53:33

After two years of dating, they decided to head to the court house and skip the big wedding. But the one tradition Quinn didn't want to miss? Buying his fiancée engagement and wedding rings.

Even though Ariel says they scrape and scrape just to pay the bills and put food in their bellies, Quinn saved up just enough money to buy two matching rings for $130. Since they made Ariel happy, you'd think that would be all that matters. But in a Facebook post that has since gone viral, Ariel shares how outside influences almost ruined their special moment.

""While we were purchasing my rings however, another lady that was working there came over to help the lady selling them to us,"" Ariel says. ""She said, 'Y'all can you believe that some men get these as engagement rings? How pathetic.'"" Ariel says she saw her now-husband's face fall and responded with the classiest response ever: ""It isn't the ring that matters, it is the love that goes into buying one that is.""

In fact, Ariel says she would have married him even if he gave her a 25 cent ring from a gum ball machine. To her, it wasn't about the rings she wore on her finger, but the love and happiness he brought to her life. Clearly, this story has struck a cord with people during the expensive holiday season, as her post has been shared more than 45,000 times.

""He was afraid that the love I have for him would pale, because he couldn't afford the wedding set I wanted,"" Ariel says. ""But here I am though, court house-married, $130 ring set, the love of my life by my side, and happier than I could ever imagine.""

After nine months of exhaustive research in the realms of art, fashion, architecture, travel and more, color experts have determined that the color we’ll see everywhere next year is ... green.

Or Greenery, to be more specific. Say hello to what experts call the “zesty yellow-green” tone of 2017:

Pantone

After what many would call one of the most disastrous years in modern history, this “reassuring” color will “provide us with the hope we collectively yearn for,” according to a Pantone press release.

And no, the color was not chosen in response to the election results. The New York Times reports that Pantone experts noticed a proliferation of green before the election ended, originally pegging it as a symbol of new beginnings under our presumed first female president.

Politics aside, Pantone recommends working Greenery into your home, whether it’s with a Greenery-colored couch:

No matter how you choose to incorporate Greenery into your life next year (or not), just remember that this color is here for YOU.

There’s only one way to know if your partner is cheating: Nope, it’s not by thumbing through their text messages and emails. To really get down to the truth, you have to ask your spouse directly.

“Instead of becoming a detective and snooping through their phone, consider talking about it,” Elisa Dombrowski, a marriage and family therapist in Orange County, California, told The Huffington Post. “Let them know you can handle the truth and that you believe you can work through anything, as long as there’s honesty.”

Below, Dombrowski and other marriage therapists offer more advice for broaching the delicate subject.

You deserve to know if your partner is faithful. If you have a suspicion that something is amiss in your relationship, don’t ignore the warning signs, Dombrowski said.

“Some people worry that confronting their partner will force the break up of their relationship,” she said. “They hope it will go away on its own but it’s often this lack of communication that creates distance in the relationship from the beginning, making it easier for an affair to take place.”

Ultimately, you should trust your intuition and broach the subject delicately, she said.

Advertisement

“Too often, we condition ourselves to ignore that tiny voice inside that says something doesn’t feel quite right,” Dombrowski added.

Don’t lower yourself to snooping through email or text messages, especially if you’re hopeful your relationship can withstand any possible betrayal, said Stephanie Mintz, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles, California.

“Resist the temptation to snoop,” she told HuffPost. “This would be a total breach of trust and privacy on your part and would make rebuilding that trust much more difficult. Although you may suspect your partner or spouse has already broken the trust, you don’t want to add fuel to the fire.”

Timing is critical when discussing a subject this sensitive, Mintz said. You’ll both need to be in the right frame of mind, so to that end, don’t bring it up at 12 a.m. on a Monday, when you’re both exhausted. (Indeed, studies have shown that the brain’s emotional centers are more reactive when we’re sleep deprived.)

“You don’t want this to be rushed and you don’t want to do it before work, when children are around or with an activity to go to shortly after,” Mintz said. “Wait for an evening after each of you has had some time to unwind from work or a weekend where you don’t have plans for later on in the day.”

This is bound to be an uncomfortable conversation. You may want to begin the talk by acknowledging how uneasy it makes you, said Todd Creager, a marriage therapist in Orange County, California and the author of The Little Black Book On Infidelity.

“Let your partner know that you have some uneasy feelings and need him or her to help you sort through them,” he said. “Then go ahead and let your partner know what you are suspicious of or what caused your uneasiness.”

Your spouse still may get angry and defensive ― especially if your suspicions are true ― “but you’re cutting down the chances of defensiveness by focusing on yourself and not your partner,” Creager said.

Let your partner know that when you feel uneasy or have an intuition, you owe it to yourself to check it out, Creager said.

“By bringing it up, you are educating your partner that you have integrity,” he said. “Let him or her know that you are owed the truth if nothing else. You deserve to know what is truly going on so that you can make a good decision for yourself.”

It can be isolating and painful to deal with infidelity. Depending on the answer you receive from your partner, you might consider seeking individual or couples therapy afterward, Dombrowski said.",2016-12-09 08:52:02

United will become the first big U.S. airline to limit low-fare customers to one carry-on bag that fits under a seat.

The announcement on Tuesday could frustrate flyers who already feel burdened with airline travel restrictions and fees.

Advertisement

United, the No. 3 U.S. airline by passengers carried, said customers who bought its cheapest fares would not be assigned seats until the day of departure, meaning people on the same ticket may be split apart.

United will also prohibit these travelers from carrying on bags that can only fit in overhead bins, and they will not accrue miles toward elite status.

The company expects the moves to add $4.8 billion to its annual operating income by 2020, although the figure does not include rising wages.

Fare initiatives such as “basic economy” will account for $1 billion of this, as more customers pay to check bags or select higher fares that give them two “free” carry-ons.

United’s announcement follows Delta Air Lines’ decision to sell cheap tickets that prohibit itinerary changes and seat selection.

“This action clearly shows how airline consolidation is eliminating choice,” Charlie Leocha, chairman of consumer advocacy group Travelers United, said in an email. “Simply stated, this is an example of airline consolidation gone too far, with choice and transparency being wrung out of the system.”

Klaus Lahnstein via Getty Images

Delta and United hope to lure customers with cheap fares and upsell them once they reveal the conditions of the ticket. It’s a practice they are using to compete with low-cost carriers Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines, which charge for add-ons including carry-on bags.

“Customers have told us that they want more choice and Basic Economy delivers just that,” Julia Haywood, United’s chief commercial officer, said in a news release.

The boarding process will also be faster because fewer customers will be searching for overhead bin space, United said.

Chicago-based United said it would begin selling the no-frills fares in the first quarter of 2017 for travel starting in the second quarter. Prices will be comparable to low fares it now charges for the economy cabin, but with more restrictions.

The initiative is part of United’s long-promised plan to rival Delta, which is more profitable and cancels fewer flights.",2016-12-08 08:50:34

That's where Anna Rothschild of PBS' digital series, Gross Science comes in. As Rothschild explains, chemicals that help the uterus contract and shed its lining each month also sometimes travel over to the bowels, forcing them to do the same. Hence, poop.

In addition, levels of a hormone called progesterone, which tends to be constipating, drop when the body is menstruating. As a result, poops tend to flow more freely.

293,Only if it hurts. #stopclickbait,http://www.prevention.com/fitness/should-you-worry-if-your-knees-crack,"In most cases, if your knees crack but don't hurt, then the noise is just crepitus—gas bubbles bursting, says Tony Gentilcore, CSCS, cofounder of Cressey Sports Performance in Massachusetts. Sure, crepitus sounds scary, but those gases—oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide—are just part of synovial fluid, a natural joint lubricant. So relax, you're fine.

Another harmless knee noisemaker: Your tendons may be clicking back into place after shifting slightly out of their original position.

What isn't normal is popping accompanied by pain.

""Some people push their knees too far forward while squatting, and that puts a lot of undue stress on their joints,"" Gentilcore says. Over time, this causes cartilage to wear down and lose its smoothness, resulting in an audible noise when your bones grind against each other as you bend.

Worst case? You'll tear your meniscus.

(For even more ways to improve your squat, check out The Secrets to the Perfect Squat.)

If your knees hurt, it's probably best to have them checked out by a doctor. You may be told to take a few weeks off from working out to let any swelling die down.

When you return to lifting, check your form with the wall squat test: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and toes touching a wall. Then squat. If your knees hit the wall, try again, this time keeping your hips back and shins vertical. Do it right and you'll be rewarded with silence.

(Cochineal insects, to be exact) #stopclickbait",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/red-food-dye-cochineal-bugs_us_56fafd25e4b083f5c605f3dd,"Red food dye has always given our beloved red velvet cupcakes their rich, festive color. But that aesthetic pleasure comes with a pretty nasty secret.

Much of the red coloring we use in food is actually made of crushed bugs. Yep, creepy, crawly bugs.

Cochineal insects, as they're known, are scale insects that, in their pre-crushed state, look like this:

Lal via Getty Images Bugs today, red velvet cupcakes tomorrow.

Cochineal insects can be found on prickly pear cacti in the North American deserts, where they spends most of their lives sucking away on the plants’ sap. They produce a bitter, crimson-colored pigment called carminic acid, which they store in their guts and use to ward off predators.

To make red dye, manufacturers dry the cochineals and grind them into a powder. The powder turns a bright red when mixed with water.

It may sound gross, but humans have been brightening up life with the crushed guts of cochineals for centuries.

The Mixtec Indians of pre-Hispanic Mexico even farmed and domesticated the bugs, using the dye to color their clothing and show off their social status. By the 1900s, Americans began using cochineal dye to color a variety of foods, including sausages, pies, dried shrimp, candy and jams.

But when word got out that the crushed-bug dye was in Starbucks' beloved Strawberries and Creme Frappuccinos in 2012, people started to freak.

Starbucks ditched the dye completely, but cochineal dye is still widely used in the food industry -- just check the labels on colored Jell-O packages, candies and yogurts for the words carmine, carminic acid or cochineal extract.

And while cochineal dye definitely has an ick-factor, the alternatives are synthetic, including one dye that is made from coal tar sludge, according to Bob Alderink of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.

""Cochineal dye has been around for centuries. It is a natural, renewable resource,"" Alderink explains in a video. ""And in my opinion, it's just plain cool.""

295,A blender. ,http://www.countryliving.com/home-design/a40286/the-only-kitchen-appliance-you-really-need/,"In any kitchen—whether apartment-size tiny or suburban-level enormous—there are bound to be some superfluous tools that you can get rid of. Until a few weeks ago, even our friends at Delish didn't understand the complete potential of the whisk and that it could replace six utensils in your drawer. And now we're here to tell you about the one and only countertop appliance you really, truly need to buy: a high-power blender.

I realize I might upset a lot of you with this one, but before you fire off your arguments for your beloved toaster oven or precious slow cooker, you need to hear me out. A super-charged blender can do so much more than you realize—so much more than stir together a post-workout smoothie.

It's so useful that even the New York Times lists it as the only essential kitchen tool beyond a list of basic knifes, spoons, pots, and pans. In many aspects it replaces other appliances, but most importantly it completes jobs you couldn't accomplish without one. Let's be real: you can't hand-cut ice or hand-grind pesto quite the same way the blades on one of these babies could. With other appliances, you can get the job done by other means (looking at you, toaster oven, slow cooker, stand mixers, rice cooker, juicer).

A souped-up blender can get all of these tasks done in a breeze: juice without a juicer; make pesto, peanut butter, hummus, and other spreads; blend and boil soups; whip up smoothies; crush ice; mix dry and wet ingredients like a stand mixer; prepare baby food; simmer sauces; the list goes on. You just have to make sure you're investing in a top-notch model like the Vitamix or the Blendtec to get the most bang for your buck—and to toss all your other cabinet-dominating appliances for good.

New Balance wants “to make more shoes in the United States, not less,” global PR manager Mary Lawton told HuffPost in a statement. “New Balance publicly supported the trade positions of Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump prior to election day that focused on American manufacturing job creation and we continue to support them today.”

We understand the instinct. Poultry sometimes feels like it could use a little wash ― it can have a somewhat slimy quality to it. But whatever you do this Thanksgiving, absolutely DO NOT wash your bird.

According to the USDA, rinsing your turkey will not get rid of unwanted bacteria ― that is virtually impossible. Actually, washing it can increase the chance of spreading bacteria. This is because water that splashes from the bird onto countertops or other surfaces spreads the bacteria and creates a real possibility for cross contamination.

“The risk of cross-contamination through washing poultry is far greater than shoving it in the oven without washing it, which makes the risk almost zero,” Fergus Clydesdale, head of the food science department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, told The New York Times.",2016-11-20 13:45:00
298,"Donating goods to large national or international companies costs more to ship, and often goods don't meet health standards. However, if you donate to local food banks, it's totally fine and you should do so. ",http://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a40514/why-you-shouldnt-donate-canned-goods-to-charity/,"The holiday season is a time of goodwill and giving, and for many families that means rounding up canned foods, creating care packages, or knitting scarves for those in need. But if you're not careful, your well-meaning actions could be entirely in vain.

That's because a deluge of dry goods during the Christmas season creates more work for volunteers, who are tasked with sorting through warehouses full of groceries, blankets, and clothing. ""The direct donation of goods, especially in the wake of a disaster, can truly cause more harm than good...[creating] a second crisis of sorts,"" writes Abby Glassenberg, the blogger behind While She Naps and wife of a charity fundraiser.

In fact, there are numerous reasons many organizations prefer monetary over physical donations, according to blogger Edward McIntyre:

Shipping and storing donations costs more than buying new items.

Many donated items don't meet the health and safety standards for redistribution.

Larger organizations like the Red Cross don't need them because they have pre-existing arrangements for food, shelter, and clothing.

Perhaps most importantly, the collective buying power of a large nonprofit can stretch your dollar beyond anything you'd be able to buy or make on your own, writes McIntyre.

If you really want to make a difference, your best bet is writing a check to a trustworthy organization that you've vetted through Charity Navigator. This sentiment is especially true in the aftermath of a natural disaster, when those affected may not have the means to store foods. (If they've been displaced from their homes, a one-way bus ticket to a relative's house is going to help more than a boatload of canned beans.)

The one exception to this rule is local food banks, which often request non-perishable items like canned soups, peanut butter, and cereals. Find one in your community at Feeding America, but be sure to confirm that it accepts food donations from individuals, as many do not.

For people who are short on cash but flush with time and/or crafting skills, Glassenberg suggests selling your crafts to raise money for your designated charity, either at a fundraising event or via online marketplace like Etsy. Just be sure to clearly state what percentage of your proceeds go to charity, and keep enough of the earnings to recoup the costs of materials and supplies.

Volunteering is another great option, and bringing the whole family along gives children the opportunity to experience the spirit of giving.

299,Bangs. ,http://www.prevention.com/beauty/haircut-makes-you-look-years-younger,"Photo by Sharon Kennedy/Getty Images

In case you needed proof that bangs do, as hairstylists always promise, make you look younger, how's this: At 17 years older than the legal drinking limit, I was carded the other night at a wine store! For the first time in Dionysus-knows-when. (Lose up to 25 pounds in 2 months—and look more radiant than ever—with the new Younger In 8 Weeks plan!)

This isn't the first such bangs-take-off-years incident I've experienced: Several years ago, right after a haircut involving bangs, I went out for pizza with my friend Jolene—who had also gotten bangs, because, you know, that's what girls do when they're not having pillow fights—and the waiter asked if we wanted a drink: ""Like a root beer or sumthin'?"" he chirped. Uh huh.

But here's the secret: Not just any old fringe will do. The keys to young-looking bangs, according to hairstylist Matt Fugate of the Sally Hershberger Downtown salon (who snipped my bangs a few weeks ago), are as follows:

1. They should be thick. Wispy pieces can make hair look thin. And anthropologically speaking, thick, lush hair is a sign of youth and fertility. You know, if looking fertile is your thing.

2. They shouldn't be totally blunt. ""I love my razor,"" says Fugate, who uses it to ever so slightly vary the lengths of the ends.

3. They should hit between the eyebrows and tops of your eyes. Super-short bangs can be cute, but they have a retro feel…which, visually, can = old.

300,"Physically she felt the effects of working out, but mentally her concentration went down. ",http://www.wellandgood.com/good-sweat/cubii-at-desk-elliptical-review/slide/3/,"Y ou have a never-ending to-do list at work, a friend who keeps trying to book you for a catch-up dinner, and that pile of laundry overflowing from your hamper that needs to be done tonight—and you really want to squeeze in a workout before the new episode of ou have a never-ending to-do list at work, a friend who keeps trying to book you for a catch-up dinner, and that pile of laundry overflowing from your hamper that needs to be done tonight—and you really want to squeeze in a workout before the new episode of The Voice. Sound familiar?

One possible solution: an at-work workout. Yes, you can lift and squeeze those Kombucha bottles over your head when your boss isn't looking, but in terms of seamlessly toning while sending an email to a colleague about a new proposal, you'll need something that ""blends in.""

Which is why, when I received an email about Cubii—the small, portable, at-desk elliptical—I was instantly intrigued. ""Burn up to 100-150 calories per hour,"" they promised, all while sitting at my desk and writing about the latest in printed leggings and super-hydrating smoothies? Um, where do I sign up?!

Cubii is advertised as the ultimate portable, quiet (so no side-eyeing from your coworkers), and ergonomic (which means your knees don't bang into the bottom of your desk every time you pedal) desk-side exercise equipment. With a price tag that hovers in the mid-three digits—at $347, it's the equivalent of a multi-month gym membership)—I couldn't just take their word for it.

Related Stories

So, I decided to take the Cubii challenge. Here's what happened.

After a fairly easily assembly—a screwdriver is provided—I hit one minor speed bump: Although they wisely provide stoppers for under-the-wheels of your chair, the wheels of my chair were too big and I was sliding backwards. After a quick chair-swap for a standard four-post chair from the conference room, I was off!

The Cubii allows eight different levels of resistance and I instinctively turned mine to a level seven—one too many Barry's Bootcamp classes has taught me I can always go a bit harder. Anything lower than that just felt a bit too low-resistance for me—and besides, I was trying to get a genuine burn in. While I wasn't sweating as if I were on a full-size elliptical, I quickly discovered that if I engaged my core and sat up straight, I definitely felt the workout tingle.

While I wasn't sweating as if I were on a full-size elliptical, I quickly discovered that if I engaged my core and sat up straight, I definitely felt the workout tingle.

Thanks to the free Cubii app, I learned that at a level seven, I could burn a whopping four calories per minute and my heart rate would go to what they called ""moderate exercise""—I'd call it a slightly-less-than-brisk walk. In other words, it wasn't exactly replacing my SoulCycle habit, but at least it was doing something. I aimed for about 30-60 minutes of activity per day, which added up to about an extra 1,000 calories a week that I wouldn't have burned otherwise. (Unless my super-fast typing skills add up to that much? TBD.)

But while my physical movement felt great, my mind took a glacial hit. I suddenly had trouble paying attention to the article at-hand, and was focusing more on how many RPMs (rotations-per-minute) I was doing rather than what Lea Michele and Gigi Hadid were doing.

Turns out, I'm not alone in this. ""I personally think that at-desk exercise equipment is a bit of a scam,"" Noam Tamir, a personal trainer and owner of TS Fitness in New York City, told me. (Cue sad trombone.) ""If you're actually working around the clock, sitting at a desk, and having absolutely no time to work out, then it can be beneficial. But if you're already working out outside of the office or can make time away from your desk to walk, jog, or even take the stairs, then there's no need for the bulky—and often expensive—equipment.""

Plus there's the whole multitasking thing. ""I'm a firm believe in doing one thing at a time,"" Tamir adds. ""If you're at work, then you should work, and if you're focusing enough, you should be able finish a bit earlier in order to work out outside of the office. If you're distracting yourself with less-than-effective exercise equipment, not only are you most likely slowing down your workflow, but you're working less muscle than you would somewhere else.""

""If you're already working out outside of the office, then there's no need for the bulky—and often expensive—equipment.""

Tamir's solution is simple: Get up and move every 30-40 minutes. He says that if you focus your mind during work hours, getting up once an hour to stretch your legs won't slow you down, but it will do enough to keep your blood flowing and muscles loose—and then you can get your serious sweat on pre- or post-cube.

My recommendation: Whipping up your next Big Idea while pedaling away might be a challenge, but if you're seriously time-challenged, it's a decent option for a not-so-ideal situation. I found the Cubii's rhythmic motion well-suited for routine or methodical work, like answering email and clerical tasks (hello, Excel). And one thing's for certain: the ergonomic claims don't lie. At 5'8"", I have slightly longer-than-average legs and my knees never once hit my desk.

Or, you know, maybe just take the stairs at lunch?

Emma Morano, 116, of Verbania, Italy, was born in 1899 and will turn 117 on Nov. 29. The supercentenarian claimed the title of world’s oldest person in May after the death of the former titleholder, Susannah Mushatt Jones.

Speaking to Agence France-Presse in her home, Morano revealed what she eats in a typical day.

“I eat two eggs a day and that’s it,” she said. “I eat cookies.”

But it’s not in the eggs themselves, perhaps, that the secret lies, but in their preparation ― or in her case, lack thereof. Morano has said she’s eaten two eggs raw for decades since a doctor told her it would help her anemia. (The cookies sound much more appetizing.)

Other than that, the oldest woman says she’s lived a long life thanks to not being “dominated” by anyone and to staying single since she divorced in her late 30s.

Step 1: Lightly tap your brush onto your cream or powder blush, then suck in your cheeks a bit, so you can see their hollows. Your blush should be applied right above that area. ""That's your cheekbone, where you would naturally flush if you went for a jog or spent a day at the beach,"" Radow explains.

Step 2: With light, quick strokes, brush the blush along your cheekbone, starting at the apple and blending it back toward your ear (the pigment should fade as you go, so it's not a stripe).

Step 3: Take a damp makeup sponge with a bit of cream or liquid foundation on it, tapping and blending the product over your blush. ""This will make your blush look natural, like the flush is coming from beneath your skin, and will soften shades that are super pigmented,"" Radow says.

It's a historic single-family house that's on the market in Hercules, California for $1. Yes, you saw that correctly and, no, it shouldn't be followed by ""thousand"" or ""million."" But even so, no one wants to buy it.

Why? Well, back in 2010, the town of Hercules bought the house, known as Historic Home Number 54 and called ""Queen Anne"" for it's Victorian style, for a buck with plans to renovate and preserve it. Then they cut the home in half to move it to the city's corporation yard and get to work. However, they eventually decided they couldn't devote the money or resources needed to finish the project and put it back on the market.

Today, whoever buys this home will have to move it off of the city's property and use their own money to restore it — which includes, you know, putting the two halves back together. On the list of repairs also includes a new roof, windows, electrical, paint, and plaster. ""If we can preserve it, even if it's not in our own community, that would be the preferred option,"" Hercules Planning Director, Holly Smyth, told Realtor.

If no one buys the home, she says it will have to be demolished — which would be such a shame, because look how cute the home used to be as recently as in 2005.

Fingers crossed someone snatches it up, then blogs about the experience so we can live vicariously through them.

There are no hard and fast rules for what you should or shouldn't be sharing. Anybody who claims there is—like ""only post once a day"" or ""only post pictures in artfully edited batches of no more than five""—is full of it.

But that said, if your ultimate goal on Facebook is to stay connected with old and new friends, you might wonder what causes some people, maybe even actual friends from the real world, to mysteriously dump you.

Is it something you said? Or more specifically, wrote?

MORE: The Better Man Project: 2,476 tips to keep you happy and healthy for life

Christopher Sibona, PhD, a researcher at the University of Colorado Denver, has studied why people unfriend their Facebook friends. The most common reasons:

1) Polarizing posts about politics and religion.

2) Inappropriate posts with sexist and/or racist remarks.

3) Banal topics.

The first two should be no-brainers. But number 3? That one is a little trickier. What exactly counts as ""banal""?

Can you ever really be sure? After all, what one person finds fresh and original, somebody else could dismiss as trite and hackneyed. Can you ever win if you're trying to please everyone?

Actually, trying to please everyone is often what gets us into trouble. Michael Stefanone, PhD, a communications professor at the University of Buffalo, says that many Facebook users make bad social media decisions because of something called the Multiple Audience Problem.

""When we post on social media, our audiences are super-diverse, especially compared to when we hang out with people offline,"" he says. ""Online, my audience includes colleagues, old girlfriends, potential girlfriends, casual and close friends, parents, and even grandparents.""

Each of these subgroups has different expectations of your behavior, Stefanone says. And when you try to please everybody—or don't consider their particular beliefs or values—you're going to end up pissing off at least some of them.

MORE: 5 Things You Should Never Say To Her

However, there are some status updates that we can all agree are just terrible, and you should stop posting them immediately.

Here are three of the most egregious—and dare we say, banal—status updates to avoid at all costs.

1. Anything Purposively Vague

These posts tend to be short and don't share any details that give even a hint of a context.

Updates like ""It's been one of those days"" or ""Mind blown"" or ""I can't even"" or ""Please pray for me.""

It's like you're dropping hints, and you want your friends to ask questions to get it out of you.

""We're all busy,"" says Stefanone. ""I don't have time to take this bait and ask you for more information.""

Rest assured, ""bait"" is exactly how your readers are interpreting a post like this.

""People do not like being manipulated, especially if they are drawn in without even a topic,"" says Karen North, PhD, a professor of digital social media at the USC Annenberg School.

2. The Humble Brag

Consider a status update like this: ""Got accepted into both Harvard AND Princeton, and now I have to decide between them. What a morning!""

Or this: ""Bumped into John Krasinski at the coffee shop, and we ended up talking for so long, I was totally late for work!""

North calls this a ""transparent attempt to fish for compliments.""

It is not, she says, the same as saying, ""Oh, my God, I can't believe what happened to me"" in person.

""It is clear that the writer has taken the time to log in, often post a picture, and then act as if he or she was surprised by the announcement of good fortune,"" she says.

3. The Unfriending Warning

If you're going to unfriend somebody on Facebook—either because of something they've specifically done to offend you, or as a general cleaning house (eliminating all the people you don't actually know)—then just go ahead and do it. There's no need for an announcement.

""In the real world, the vast majority of friendships fade without an active declaration of 'you are no longer my friend,'"" says Sibona.

Online unfriending is fine, but when you make threats in advance, ""Not only can this be perceived as poor manners and rude, but with online communities, it is even worse since people really do not have the opportunity to resolve whatever problems led to the threat,"" says North.

No two people are exactly alike, so it’s really impossible for any of us to feel completely known or understood by one another.

Robert Munsch’s Love You Forever book was published once upon a 1986, but its legacy lives on even today.

As a kindergartner, I remember sitting cross-legged and staring doe-eyed at my teacher, Mrs. Duff, as she read that Love You Forever book to us over and over during story time. You’d think it would eventually get old, but our whole class sat in a circle just as mesmerized by the tale each time it was read as though it was the first time our ears heard those memorable words that made our eyes well up with tears. You’ve probably heard at least one of the love you forever book quotes, such as:

I’ll love you forever,

I’ll like you for always,

As long as I’m living my baby you’ll be.

What’s the Love You Forever book basically about?

If you haven’t read the Love You Forever book, in summary, the story chronicles the life of a mother and son as the boy grows up. Through the sleepless nights as an infant to his ‘terrible two’s‘ and his pre-teen years where mom wanted to “sell him to the zoo,” she still loved him fearlessly and unconditionally, always ending the night with the same song as she rocked her boy to bed…

I’ll love you forever,

I’ll like you for always,

As long as I’m living my baby you’ll be.

As the boy grows older and leaves home to start his own family, his mother occasionally sneaks into his bedroom to rock her grown man with her customary lullaby. (In hindsight, as an adult, that part sounds a tad creepier than it did when I was five, but the moral of the story is still undeniably sweet.)

Eventually in the love you forever book, his mom grows old and very sick and she calls her son over to sing the song to him, but she could only make it halfway through. Knowing that she wouldn’t be able to hold on much longer, he began rocking her in his arms, singing the lullaby full of love that had carried him through his largely defiant life. Afterward, he went home saddened but found new hope in rocking his own baby girl to sleep with the same heartfelt words that would forever carry on his mother’s legacy.

What’s the Love You Forever book really about?

Though the message in this story and the song seems pretty clear, it’s probably not about what you think. It is actually inspired by the author’s two stillborn babies…thus the “my baby you’ll be” part.

Munsch shared this statement on his website:

I made that up after my wife and I had two babies born dead. The song was my song to my dead babies. For a long time I had it in my head and I couldn’t even sing it because every time I tried to sing it I cried. It was very strange having a song in my head that I couldn’t sing. For a long time it was just a song, but one day, while telling stories at a big theatre at the University of Guelph, it occurred to me that I might be able to make a story around the song. Out popped Love You Forever, pretty much the way it is in the book.

Wow. It’s amazing that this explanation coming out 30 years later can totally alter the meaning of this book. Yet in a sense, it’s all the same—perhaps that’s why this timeless tale has lived on.

On the face of it, the story seems to be about a mom who who will never stop loving her son as big as he grows or as long as he lives, but really, it’s the same for stillborn babies and miscarriages. Just because they were taken to heaven early, doesn’t mean their parents’ love died along with their flesh. In the same way, they will be loved forever, long after they’re gone.

So for the big boys, the baby girls and the little angels in heaven, this tune will remain forever true:

I’ll love you forever,

I’ll like you for always,

As long as I’m living my baby you’ll be.

Now, those are 18 beautiful words worth remembering for always. ❤",2016-11-07 06:47:41

310,They put sunblock on their eyes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/space/some-people-didnt-quite-understand-what-watch-safely-meant-during-the-eclipse/,"The Great American Eclipse was a wonderful, perhaps once-in-a-lifetime, opportunity to see the gorgeous cosmic ballet in action. It also seemed to provoke plenty of people up and down the country to do something rather stupid: look at the Sun during the eclipse without any protective glasses on at all.

Although the most famous person to ignore the advice of essentially every scientist and journalist on the planet was the President of the United States, spikes in Google searches for terms like “I looked at the Sun” and “eclipse headache” reveal that he wasn’t alone in this endeavor.

Somehow, though, things get stranger still. As reported by WCYB, a local news station in Virginia, some people were apparently putting sunscreen in their eyes so that they could “safely” look at the eclipse.

Nurse Practioner Trish Patterson told WCYB’s sister station, KRCR, that although she hasn’t seen any patients coming in with eclipse-related ocular damage, she has seen a few people come in after dousing their peep holes in a product that is quite clearly just meant to adorn the skin.

As you might have guessed, sunscreen in the eye doesn’t have the same effect as a lens specifically designed to filter out most wavelengths of light. Too little sunscreen and it’ll burn a little as it oozes around the white sclera of your eyeball. Too much, and you just wouldn’t be able to see anything anyway.

Either way, it’d cause you to cry a lot, which only seems appropriate during an eclipse if you’re overcome with emotion.

You can see where these unfortunate few hospital patients were coming from when they decided to squeeze some SPF 20 unguent into their eyes, but this course of action was about as useful and as sensible as using nail varnish on your tongue, or injecting shampoo into your nostrils. Do not do these things.

Maybe eclipses just bring out the oddest behaviors in people. Plenty thought it was a sign of the apocalypse, if Google Trends is anything to go by. One radio host suggested that the highly predictable astronomical event was actually the work of the Prince of Darkness.

311,The risk from artificial intelligence. ,http://www.iflscience.com/technology/elon-musk-warns-theres-something-we-should-be-more-worried-about-than-north-korea/,"Elon Musk recently tweeted that we may be more at risk from artificial intelligence (AI) than the current nuclear threat by North Korea.

Clearly concerned with the increasing advancement in technology, Musk took to Twitter to voice his fears and deliver a warning to developers, and possible regulators of the industry.

""If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea,"" he wrote.

This comes at a time of increasing tension between North Korea and the USA, in which the threat of nuclear weapons is becoming more and more real with each day. Despite this, Musk believes our greatest threat lies currently in the virtually unregulated AI industry, and as such is now calling for improvements to be made.

-

He followed on from his previous tweet by stating ""everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too.""

Admittedly, AI technology is developing rapidly. OpenAI, a company led by Musk, recently succeeded in reaching a huge milestone in AI progress – an AI bot consistently beat professional human opponents in 1v1 scenarios in the popular video game Dota. This is particularly impressive, as the bot learned how to win solely by repeatedly playing against itself over a period of three months. With minimal human coaching, it was able to learn complex mechanics, alongside exploiting its opponent’s mistakes and adapting to random play styles – achievements far more advanced than the board games tested previously.

This occurred on August 12 at the Grand Finals of The International 7, the largest annual Dota tournament, with a staggering prize pool of nearly $25million and the victory of being watched by nearly 4.7million people.

Whether this game off was for entertainment purposes, or to show the power and speed of progression of current AI technology, we're not sure, but the bot certainly made an impression.

Whilst the warning appears worrying, don’t start running to find a cave to live in just yet, it isn’t the first time Musk has predicted danger from AIs. In 2014, he tweeted:

-

Clearly he hasn’t changed his mind since then, and is still fighting to get across the importance of the issue.

Perhaps with this demonstration, and the rate at which AIs are growing in intelligence, it really is time to begin regulating the industry and collaborating between developers to understand AIs better. After all, if they are actually more dangerous than nukes, we’re going to need all the help we can get.",2017-08-15 14:01:03

313,Kitchen sponge. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/kitchen-sponges-hoard-more-bacteria-than-anywhere-else-in-the-house/,"If you're curious where most of the bacteria lurks in your house, wonder no longer. Kitchen sponges are now the undisputed leaders of bacteria stockpiling.

The research, published in Scientific Reports, looked at the microbial diversity of building environments. Unsurprisingly, they found that a kitchen sponge is a good place for bacteria – after all, it tends to remain rich in water and come into contact with food – but most of us don't know just how much bacteria. Sponges show a local density of 54 billion bacterial cells per cubic centimeter. That is equivalent to the number of bacteria estimated to be in human feces.

“Despite common misconception, it was demonstrated that kitchen environments host more microbes than toilets,” the researchers wrote in the study. “This was mainly due to the contribution of kitchen sponges which were proven to represent the biggest reservoirs of active bacteria in the whole house”

Not only are sponges full of bacteria, they also spread bacteria all around the kitchen when we clean with them. While this might seem utterly disgusting, it’s important to realize that bacteria are everywhere. We have just as many bacterial cells in our body as we have human cells, for example. The focus needs to be on how many dangerous bacteria the sponges harbor.

For this reason, the team produced the first comprehensive analysis of the bacterial microbiome of sponges. They discovered that the most abundant type of bacteria belongs to the Moraxellaceae family, averaging 36 percent across the sample. Moraxellaceae represents the typical human skin bacteria, so we bring them to the sponge, where they multiply and can become potentially dangerous. Most of the bacteria they found was not dangerous, although some were.

""What surprised us was that five of the ten [types] which we most commonly found, belong to the so-called risk group 2 (RG2),"" said lead researcher, microbiologist Markus Egert in a statement, ""which means they are potential pathogens.""

The main three were Acinetobacter johnsonii, Moraxella osloensis, and Chryseobacterium hominis.

The study also looked at how to avoid an overbundance of this bacteria. “Sanitation by boiling or microwave treatment has been shown to significantly reduce the bacterial load of kitchen sponges and can, therefore, be regarded as a reasonable hygiene measure. However, our data showed that regularly sanitized sponges (as indicated by their users) did not contain less bacteria than uncleaned ones.”

The cleaning procedures actually changed the microbiome – and not exactly for the better. Moraxellaceae and Chryseobacterium hominis appeared to increase in number, as they are more resistant than competing bacteria. This suggests that prolonged sanitation of kitchen sponges might have counterproductive effects. The researchers think that to reduce risk, the best option is to replace the sponges regularly.",2017-08-02 08:46:47
314,"Wind and associated pressure waves would flatten everything, including you. #StopClickbait",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/3/15903154/asteroid-death-one-chart,"The chances of dying via an asteroid impact are very, very small.

Asteroids that pose an existential threat to life on Earth only strike once every 500,000 years or more. Even the 140-meter-wide asteroids that could destroy cities and regions rain down death once every 10,000 years. (Though, to note: One of this approximate size just sailed past the Earth, coming within 45,000 miles of our planet, to the surprise of scientists who didn’t see it coming.)

The risk of being even injured from a 20-meter object — like the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 and hurt nearly 1,500 people — is tiny.

But, okay: WHAT IF? If a huge asteroid were to smash into Earth, what would happen to us? We all know Hollywood’s take: Either we’ll be engulfed by a huge fireball or swallowed by a massive tsunami.

The journal Geophysical Research Letters in 2017 published an analysis of the likely source of casualties from an asteroid impact. In it, the scientists ran a computer model where they simulated the impact of 50,000 asteroids — from the very tiny to 400-meter monsters — all over the globe. They estimated how each of the asteroids would create chaos (i.e., if they hit in water, they’d perhaps create a tsunami, if they hit land, they would generate debris and a shockwave), and estimated the causalities of each of the impacts based on the population density in the area.

In sum, here’s what they found: If you’re going to die via an asteroid, it will be the wind and shockwave that gets you.

Surprisingly ""effects such as cratering, seismic shaking and ejecta deposition [i.e., ejected debris] provide only a minor contribution to overall loss,"" the study concluded. If Asteroid 2019 OK — the name of the one that just made a near-miss of the Earth — collided with our planet, most people in the impact area (poor souls) would have died due to wind.

Why wind? It’s because if a large-enough asteroid explodes in the air before hitting the Earth (and generating tsunamis, craters, and fire-filled torrents of death), the resulting shockwave could blast winds powerful enough to flatten cities. The pressure from the blast could rupture internal organs. Bottom line: An asteroid doesn’t have to reach the ground intact to cause chaos. In their analysis, 60 percent of all asteroid deaths were caused by wind and pressure.

The chart above shows that as the asteroids get larger, your chances of dying of anything other than wind increase, but the wind would still the No. 1 cause of death.

Tsunamis aren’t as much of a factor, relatively speaking, because in many areas, the geography of the shoreline would dampen their destructive reach, New Scientist explains in its report on the study. Also: Wind is a factor in every asteroid collision, and tsunamis are only implicated in impacts over water.

So, should this graphic keep you up at night? No.

Talking about the risk of asteroid impact is tricky. We’re not likely to see a huge destructive asteroid in our lifetimes. Those threaten future generations. “You have to think about the risk in terms of it’s not a risk to a person or a city, but a risk to humanity,” said Eric Christensen, who hunts asteroids for NASA at the Catalina Sky Survey.

Small asteroid strikes are much more likely. But for one to land near you would be an incredible stroke of bad luck.

“One of the most remarkable things about the Chelyabinsk impactor for me was that it happened over a populated area,” Christensen says. “Ninety-eight percent of the planet is unpopulated or very sparsely populated.”

And that’s why NASA’s tracking these baddies now. The more we keep an eye on them, the more we can devise engineering solutions to push a deadly asteroid off a collision course. The Center for Near Earth Object Studies at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory has logged around 18,000 asteroids that come close to Earth’s orbital neighborhood. And there are thousands more to find.

315,"The article doesn't actually say it outright, but it is suggesting every 1-2 weeks. .",http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/how-often-you-should-wash-your-bed-sheets-according-to-a-microbiologist-and-what-happens-when-you-dont/,"We spend more than a third of our lives in bed — but that place can quickly blossom into a ""botanical park"" of bacteria and fungus, according to New York University microbiologist Philip Tierno.

If left for too long, the microscopic life within the wrinkles and folds of our bed sheets can even make us sick, Tierno told Business Insider.

To stem the invisible tide, he said, sheets should be washed once a week.

Humans naturally produce roughly 26 gallons of sweat in bed every year. When it's hot and humid outside, this moisture becomes what scientists call an ""ideal fungal culture medium.""

In a recent study that assessed the level of fungal contamination in bedding, researchers found that a test sample of feather and synthetic pillows that were 1 1/2 to 20 years old contained as many as 16 species of fungus each.

And it's not just your own microbial life you're sleeping with. In addition to the fungi and bacteria that come from your sweat, sputum, skin cells, and vaginal and anal excretions, you also share your bed with foreign microbes. These include animal dander, pollen, soil, lint, dust mite debris and feces, and finishing agents from whatever your sheets are made from, to name a few.

Tierno says all that gunk becomes ""significant"" in as little as a week. And unclean bedding still exposes you to materials that can trigger the sniffing and sneezing, since the microbes are so close to your mouth and nose that you're almost forced to breathe them in.

""Even if you don't have allergies per se, you can have an allergic response,"" Tierno said.

Another reason your sheets get dirty quickly has little to do with your behavior or sweat patterns — the issue is simply gravity.

""Just like Rome over time was buried with the debris that falls from gravity, gravity is what brings all that material into your mattress,"" Tierno said.

One to two weeks of this buildup is enough to leave anyone with a scratchy throat — especially those with significant allergies or asthma. (One in six Americans has allergies.)

""If you touched dog poo in the street, you'd want to wash your hands,"" Tierno said. ""Consider that analogous to your bedding. If you saw what was there — but of course you don't see it — after a while you have to say to yourself, 'Do I want to sleep in that?'""

That’s what’s illustrated (in graphic detail) in the video at the top of this story.

I’m not trying to provoke panic about watching the solar eclipse. Hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions — of people across the United States are going to walk outside Aug. 21, look up, and see something truly spectacular. That’s something I look forward to.

Advertisement

But because I’m curious (and quite a few people have asked), I thought it would be interesting to talk about what would happen if you tried to look at the sun during the eclipse. And don’t tell me it doesn’t happen and people know better. That’s not true.

According to an expert answer on the University of California at Santa Barbara ScienceLine, ” … doctors collect information after events like the 1999 solar eclipse, when people who stared directly at the sun for several minutes went to see their doctor. In one study, about half had permanent damage.”

Story continues below advertisement

An assessment after the same eclipse in Britain found fewer cases than they had feared, but 14 people still managed to damage their eyes by staring at the eclipse.

There’s even a tale that Isaac Newton stared at the sun with one eye (for the sake of science, of course), and afterward he could only see reds and blues. I have no idea if that is fiction or fact, but it sure makes a good story.

Want to watch the eclipse safely? Here’s how it will go …

… if you’re in the path of totality:

It will start as a partial eclipse as the moon begins to cover the sun. Keep your glasses on at this point.

When the sun is totally blocked by the moon, you can take your glasses off! Enjoy. It’s beautiful.

Story continues below advertisement

Once sunlight starts to appear again, as the moon departs, put your glasses back on and enjoy the partial eclipse.

… if you’re not in the path of totality:

You’ll only be seeing a partial eclipse. There will be harmful sun rays for the duration of the event. Keep your eclipse glasses on through the whole thing.

Yes, you will go blind if you manage to endure the pain and stare at the sun for long enough. The pain from the visible part of the light spectrum could be extreme, but ultraviolet light — which we can’t see — can also damage the eye. It literally gives your eye a sunburn.

The reason a few people always end up going blind during an eclipse is that in the partial phase, the visible light is reduced enough that it’s no longer painful or uncomfortable to look at and so people assume it’s safe. But depending on the sky conditions, it only takes about a minute and a half for your eyes to be permanently damaged, and the damage is cumulative, meaning you don’t have to stare at the sun without looking away for it to be harmful — you may just be taking quick glances, but it’s still damaging your eye.

If your eyes are damaged, your vision will at least be blurry and you may see dark or yellow spots. If it’s significant damage, you may not be able to see out of the center of your eye — only your peripheral vision.

Other things you should be aware of: Some drugs dilate your pupils, which will decrease the amount of time it will take to burn the eye. People taking these drugs should always take care to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Also, looking through a camera lens or a telescope will not protect your eyes. The latter is blatantly obvious in the video. Unless it has a filter on it that is made specifically for blocking out the harmful rays, you should not look through any lenses.",2017-07-02 11:00:28
317,Far less than 0.01% increase in cancer risk (for the average flyer). ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/air-travel-exposes-you-to-radiation-how-much-health-risk-comes-with-it/all/,"This past April, business traveler Tom Stuker became the world’s most frequent flyer, logging 18,000,000 miles of air travel on United Airlines over the last 14 years.

That’s a lot of time up in the air. If Stuker’s traveling behaviors are typical of other business flyers, he may have eaten 6,500 inflight meals, drunk 5,250 alcoholic beverages, watched thousands of inflight movies and made around 10,000 visits to airplane toilets.

He would also have accumulated a radiation dose equivalent to about 1,000 chest x-rays. But what kind of health risk does all that radiation actually pose?

Cosmic rays coming at you

You might guess that a frequent flyer’s radiation dose is coming from the airport security checkpoints, with their whole-body scanners and baggage x-ray machines, but you’d be wrong. The radiation doses to passengers from these security procedures are trivial.

The major source of radiation exposure from air travel comes from the flight itself. This is because at high altitude the air gets thinner. The farther you go from the Earth’s surface, the fewer molecules of gas there are per volume of space. Thinner air thus means fewer molecules to deflect incoming cosmic rays – radiation from outer space. With less atmospheric shielding, there is more exposure to radiation.

The most extreme situation is for astronauts who travel entirely outside of the Earth’s atmosphere and enjoy none of its protective shielding. Consequently, they receive high radiation doses. In fact, it is the accumulation of radiation dose that is the limiting factor for the maximum length of manned space flights. Too long in space and astronauts risk cataracts, cancer and potential heart ailments when they get back home.

Indeed, it’s the radiation dose problem that is a major spoiler for Elon Musk’s goal of inhabiting Mars. An extended stay on Mars, with its extremely thin atmosphere, would be lethal due to the high radiation doses, notwithstanding Matt Damon’s successful Mars colonization in the movie “The Martian.”

Radiation risks of ultra frequent flying

What would be Stuker’s cumulative radiation dose and what are his health risks?

It depends entirely on how much time he has spent in the air. Assuming an average flight speed (550 mph), Stuker’s 18,000,000 miles would translate into 32,727 hours (3.7 years) of flight time. The radiation dose rate at typical commercial airline flight altitude (35,000 feet) is about 0.003 millisieverts per hour. (As I explain in my book “Strange Glow: The Story of Radiation,” a millisievert or mSv is a unit of radiation dose that can be used to estimate cancer risk.) By multiplying the dose rate by the hours of flight time, we can see that Stuker has earned himself about 100 mSv of radiation dose, in addition to a lot of free airline tickets. But what does that mean for his health?

The primary health threat at this dose level is an increased risk of some type of cancer later in life. Studies of atomic bomb victims, nuclear workers and medical radiation patients have allowed scientists to estimate the cancer risk for any particular radiation dose.

All else being equal and assuming that low doses have risk levels proportionate to high doses, then an overall cancer risk rate of 0.005 percent per mSv is a reasonable and commonly used estimate. Thus, Stuker’s 100-mSv dose would increase his lifetime risk of contracting a potentially fatal cancer by about 0.5 percent.

Contextualizing the risk

The question then becomes whether that’s a high level of risk. Your own feeling might depend on how you see your background cancer risk.

Most people underestimate their personal risk of dying from cancer. Although the exact number is debatable, it’s fair to say that about 25 percent of men ultimately contract a potentially fatal cancer. Stuker’s 0.5 percent cancer risk from radiation should be added to his baseline risk – so it would go from 25 percent to 25.5 percent. A cancer risk increase of that size is too small to actually measure in any scientific way, so it must remain a theoretical increase in risk.

A 0.5 percent increase in risk is the same as one chance in 200 of getting cancer. In other words, if 200 male travelers logged 18,000,000 miles of air travel, like Stuker did, we might expect just one of them to contract a cancer thanks to his flight time. The other 199 travelers would suffer no health effects. So the chances that Stuker is the specific 18-million-mile traveler who would be so unlucky is quite small.

Stuker was logging more air hours per year (greater than 2,000) than most pilots typically log (under 1,000). So these airline workers would have risk levels proportionately lower than Stuker’s. But what about you?

If you want to know your personal cancer risk from flying, estimate all of your commercial airline miles over the years. Assuming that the values and parameters for speed, radiation dose and risk stated above for Stuker are also true for you, dividing your total miles by 3,700,000,000 will give your approximate odds of getting cancer from your flying time.

For example, let’s pretend that you have a mathematically convenient 370,000 total flying miles. That would mean 370,000 miles divided by 3,700,000,000, which comes out to be 1/10,000 odds of contracting cancer (or a 0.01 percent increase in risk). Most people do not fly 370,000 miles (equal to 150 flights from Los Angeles to New York) within their lifetimes. So for the average flyer, the increased risk is far less than 0.01 percent.

To make your exercise complete, make a list of all the benefits that you’ve derived from your air travel over your lifetime (job opportunities, vacation travel, family visits and so on) and go back and look at your increased cancer risk again. If you think your benefits have been meager compared to your elevated cancer risk, maybe its time to rethink flying. But for many people today, flying is a necessity of life, and the small elevated cancer risk is worth the price.

318,Yes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/is-it-ok-to-run-in-heat-of-30-or-more/,"Most of Britain is experiencing a heatwave, with temperatures reaching up to 32℃. The public health watchdog for England has issued an amber health warning, advising people to take care in the hotter weather. But what does it mean for runners? Is it ever too hot to go for a run?

With the recent high temperatures in parts of the UK soaring above 30℃, people may find themselves questioning the safety of running in the heat. Running in hotter temperatures though is not uncommon, with many runners competing in warmer climates such as Kenya, Ethiopia and Japan, where temperatures average 25℃.

But while running in the heat may be considered a risk to some people – such as children, the elderly and pregnant women – as long as precautions are taken, running in temperatures as high as 30-35℃ is fine.

A number of running events take place in extreme heat (over 35℃), such as Badwater, the 135-mile ultra-marathon that takes place in Death Valley, California, where temperatures can sore to over 50℃. There is also the annual Marathon des Sables, a five-day run across the Sahara Desert in Morocco, where temperatures can reach 50℃. This 156-mile run is considered the toughest foot race on Earth. Our experience at Kingston University with people running and training in our heat chamber for events such as the Marathon des Sables and Badwater, demonstrates that with enough preparation, hydration and being sensible about how hard you run, it is possible to run safely in high temperatures. But it is important to note, that these races do take a lot of preparation and acclimatisation and running in such temperatures is certainly not recommended without thorough training.",2017-06-25 10:08:00

According to Dr. Ralph Holsworth, an osteopathic family medicine physician and director of clinical and scientific research for Essentia Water, hangovers do unfortunately worsen with age.

Dr. Holsworth attributes that to three main reasons.

Your body is more likely to become inflamed when you're older.

As you get older, your body goes into what Dr. Holsworth refers to as a ""pro-inflammatory state."" What he means by that is your body is more likely to become inflamed.

Inflammation is what happens to your body when it's trying to fight off an infection or heal itself in some way. When you drink, your body identifies the alcohol you consume as a chemical toxin, which then causes inflammation throughout the body.

Although inflammation is technically a good thing because it means you're healing, it's not a comfortable state for your body to be in. It often causes pain and swelling, and is partly to blame for your hangover symptoms. And because your body is more likely to become inflamed the older you get, the discomfort you feel due to a hangover will only increase with age.

You drink less water the older you get.

According to Dr. Holsworth, your body's ""thirst drive,"" or its cues to drink water, decrease with age. Alcohol already dehydrates you — which then causes you to feel like death the next day — so if you start out a night of drinking without being properly hydrated, your hangover symptoms are only going to be worse the next day.

Your body becomes less efficient at detoxifying as you get older.

Your body identifies alcohol as a toxin. So processing the alcohol you drink involves a complex method of detoxification. The liver is crucial in this process, and according to Dr. Holsworth, liver function decreases with age.

That means that when you're older, your liver just doesn't work as efficiently as it used to. Because of that, it becomes harder for your body to process alcohol.",2017-06-15 08:19:22

Flamingos are basically the models of the animal kingdom. They’re tall, slim, a fabulous color, and know how to strike a pose.

Now, scientists think they have unraveled the mysteries of why and how the feathery pink wonders assume this iconic position: It turns out flamingos can conserve more energy standing on one leg than two.

Researchers from the US discovered that flamingos’ legs have a mechanism that fixes into place when their legs are straight, meaning they don’t actually expend any muscular activity once they're in place.

Professor Young-Hui Chang of Georgia Institute of Technology and Dr Lena H Ting of Emory University, Atlanta, suspected that the birds’ legs might feature a characteristic that meant their joints could lock into place, but when they studied two donated cadavers from Birmingham Zoo, they couldn't find anything.

However, when Chang picked the bird up by its leg and held it upright, the leg fixed into place, became rigid and held.

“That was the ‘Aha!’ moment when we knew we were on to something special,” Chang told Discover. “If a dead flamingo could do it, then it is probably available for live birds to do.”

Strangely, they found the dead flamingos could not hold the pose when they tried to stand them up on two legs, which led them to suspect it takes more effort for the birds’ muscles to use two legs than just one.

They then studied the balance behaviors of eight live juvenile flamingos from Zoo Atlanta by placing them on a force-plate, basically fancy bathroom scales, and waiting for them to fall asleep. They discovered that when the flamingos were less active, they swayed less on one leg. In fact, when they fell asleep, their postural sway was seven times lower than when they were active.

Their results, published in the journal Biology letters, suggest that the flamingos rely on a passive mechanism for support, not an active one that uses muscular effort.

This seems counterintuitive because as humans we typically think standing on one leg and remaining balanced is rather difficult, requiring a lot of energy, control, and effort. However, as flamingos use their legs more for prolonged standing than running around, for them it is much more energy efficient.

Though the researchers say they need to do further tests to understand the mechanism better, their study could have many practical applications. It could explain why other birds, such as herons and storks, often do the same thing, as well as have an influence on the development of many-legged robots and prosthetic limbs in the future.

322,Vehicles will not protect you from the nuclear fallout. ,http://www.thisisinsider.com/survive-nuclear-attack-fallout-shelter-cars-2017-5?utm_content=buffere5967&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer,"Nuclear blasts create fallout, which can harm you with large doses of radiation.

Cars offer little protection from fallout.

A surer way to survive in the aftermath of a nuclear explosion is to go indoors, stay put, and listen to the radio.

The first thing you'd see if a nuclear bomb exploded nearby is a flood of light so bright, you may think the sun blew up.

Wincing from temporary blindness, you'd scan the horizon and see an orange fireball. The gurgling flames would rise and darken into purple-hued column of black smoke, which would turn in on itself. As a toadstool-like mushroom took shape, the deafening shock front of the blast would rip through the area — and possibly knock you off your feet.

Congratulations! In this hypothetical scenario, you've just survived a nuclear blast with an energy output of about 10 kilotons (20 million pounds) of TNT. That's roughly 66% of energy released by either atom bomb dropped on Japan in 1945.

This scenario may sound far-fetched, but more than 14,900 nuclear weapons exist in the world, and kiloton-class nukes (like the one we just described) are now proliferating in weapons stockpiles. In fact, a 10-kiloton-or-less nuclear detonation by a terrorist is the first of 15 disaster scenarios that the US government has planned for

No one could fault you for panicking after the sight and roar of a nuclear blast. But there is one thing you should never do, according to Brooke Buddemeier, a health physicist and radiation expert at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

""Don't get in your car,"" he tells Business Insider — don't try to drive, and don't assume that the glass and metal of a vehicle can protect you.

Why vehicles and nuclear survival don't mix

A nuclear blast vaporizes the paint off of a car. Public domain

Avoiding driving after a nuclear blast is wise because streets would probably be full of erratic drivers, accidents, and debris. But Buddemeier says there's another important reason to ditch the car: a fearsome after-effect of nuclear blasts called fallout.

Fallout is a complex mixture of fission products, or radioisotopes, that are created by splitting atoms. Many of the fission products decay rapidly and emit gamma radiation, an invisible yet highly energetic form of light. Exposure to too much of this radiation in a short time can damage the body's cells and its ability to fix itself — a condition called acute radiation sickness.

""It also affects the immune system and the your ability to fight infections,"" Buddemeier says.

Only very dense and thick materials, like many feet of dirt or inches of lead, can reliably stop the fallout.

""The fireball from a 10-kiloton explosion is so hot, it actually shoots up into the atmosphere at over 100 miles per hour,"" Buddemeier says. ""These fission products mix in with the dirt and debris that's drawn up into the atmosphere from the fireball.""

Trapped in sand, dirt, cement, metal, and anything else in the immediate blast area, the gamma-shooting fission products can fly more than five miles into the air. The larger pieces drop back down, while lighter particles can be carried by the wind before raining over distant areas.

""Close in to the [blast] site, they may be a bit larger than golf-ball-size, but really what we're talking about are things like salt- or sand-size particles,"" Buddemeier says. ""It's the penetrating gamma radiation coming off of those particles that's the hazard.""

Which brings us back to why a car is a terrible place to take shelter.

""Modern vehicles are made of glass and very light metals, and they offer almost no protection,"" he says. ""You're just going to sit on a road some place [and be exposed].""

Buddemeier says he's asked people what their knee-jerk response to a nuclear blast might be. It wasn't comforting.

""There was actually a lot of folks who had this notion — and it may be a Hollywood notion — of 'oh, jump in the car and try to skedaddle out of town if you see a mushroom cloud.'"" he says.

However, fallout is carried by high-altitude winds that are ""often booking along at 100 miles per hour,"" he says, and ""often not going in the same direction as the ground-level winds. So your ability to know where the fallout's gonna go, and outrun it, are… Well, it's very unlikely.""

What you should do instead of driving

The protection factor that various buildings, and locations within them, offer from the radioactive fallout of a nuclear blast. The higher the number, the greater the protection. Brooke Buddemeier/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

Your best shot at survival after a nuclear disaster is to get into some sort of ""robust structure"" as quickly as possible and stay there, Buddemeier says. He's a fan of the mantra ""go in, stay in, tune in"".

""Get inside ... and get to the center of that building. If you happen to have access to below-ground areas, getting below-ground is great,"" he says. ""Stay in: 12 to 24 hours.""

The reason to wait is that levels of gamma and other radiation fall off exponentially after a nuclear blast as ""hot"" radioisotopes decay into more stable atoms and pose less of a danger. This slowly shrinks the dangerous fallout zone — the area where high-altitude winds have dropped fission products. (Instead of staying put, however, a recent study also suggested that moving to a stronger shelter or basement may not be a bad idea if you first ducked into a flimsy one.)

The dangerous fallout zone (dark purple) shrinks quickly, while the much less dangerous hot zone (faint purple) grows for about 24 hours before shrinking back. Brooke Buddemeier/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

Finally, tune in.

""Try to use whatever communication tools you have,"" he says. He added that a hand-cranked radio is a good object to keep at work and home, since emergency providers, in addition to broadcasting instructions, will be tracking the fallout cloud and trying to broadcast where any safe corridors for escape are located.

There is only one exception to the ""no cars"" rule, says Buddemeier: If you're in a parking garage with your car, the concrete might act as a shield. In that case, you could stay there and listen to a radio inside your car.

If everyone followed these guidelines after nuclear blast, he says, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved.",2017-05-25 07:29:15
323,Strawberries. ,https://www.aol.com/article/lifestyle/2017/03/21/strawberries-pesticides/21904539/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00001392,"Just because it's fruit, doesn't mean it's healthy.

Every year, over 3 billion pounds of strawberries are produced by the United States, constituting a nearly 3 billion dollar business. California is responsible for producing over 90% of the strawberry crop in America, while Florida grows the second most amount. While experts believe the production and consumption of strawberries will continue to grow each year, many are warning of its dangers.

Once again, strawberries have topped the ""Dirty Dozen"" list -- they are hailed as the fruit ""most likely to be contaminated with pesticide residues even after they are picked, rinsed in the field and washed before eating"", according to the Environmental Working Group (EWG). Other produce listed includes spinach, nectarines, apples and potatoes.

How to store every single type of fruit:

The takeaways from the EWG are quite apparent.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture found that strawberries contained nearly 8 pesticides per sample. That's more than any other sample of produce, which contained 2.3 pesticides per sample, in comparison. Scientists found that nearly 30% of strawberries had residues of more than 10 pesticides, with the ""dirtiest"" linked to 21 different pesticides.

If that doesn't deter you enough to eat organic strawberries, scientists found traces of poisonous gas on strawberries as well. These included mostly Carbendazim and Bifenthrin, which was found on 33% of the strawberry samples. These harmful chemicals have been associated with a variety of health issues, including cancer, developmental and reproductive damage, and neurological problems.

In light of this report, nutritionists are advising their clients to ""shop smart"".

""I believe that this is an important source of information,"" said Corinne Bush to CNN. Consequently, the EWG says that buyers should look for organic produce.

""Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables is essential no matter how they're grown, but for the items with the heaviest pesticide loads, we urge shoppers to buy organic. If you can't buy organic, the Shopper's Guide will steer you to conventionally grown produce that is the lowest in pesticides,"" said EWG analyst Sonya Lunder.

324,Aerobic exercise done for at least 45 minutes at a time. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-the-single-best-type-of-exercise-for-your-brain-according-to-scientists,"Want an all-natural way to lift your mood, improve your memory, and protect your brain against age-related cognitive decline? Get moving.

A wealth of recent research, including two new studies published this spring, suggests that any type of exercise that raises your heart rate and gets you moving and sweating for a sustained period of time - known as aerobic exercise - has a significant, overwhelmingly beneficial impact on the brain.

""Aerobic exercise is the key for your head, just as it is for your heart,"" write the authors of a recent article in the Harvard Medical School blog, Mind and Mood.

While some of the benefits, like a lift in mood, can emerge as soon as a few minutes into a sweaty bike ride, others, like improved memory, might take several weeks to crop up.

That means that the best type of fitness for your mind is any aerobic exercise that you can do regularly and consistently for at least 45 minutes at a time.

Depending on which benefits you're looking for, you might try adding a brisk walk or a jog to your daily routine. A pilot study in people with severe depression found that just 30 minutes of treadmill walking for 10 consecutive days was ""sufficient to produce a clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in depression.""

Aerobic workouts can also help people who aren't suffering from clinical depression feel less stressed by helping to reduce levels of the body's natural stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, according to a recent study in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science.

If you're over 50, a study published last month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggests the best results come from combining aerobic and resistance exercise.

That could include anything from high-intensity interval training, like the 7-minute workout, to dynamic flow yoga, which intersperses strength-building poses like planks and push-ups with heart-pumping dance-like moves.

Another study published on May 3 provides some additional support to that research, finding that in adults aged 60-88, walking for 30 minutes four days a week for 12 weeks appeared to strengthen connectivity in a region of the brain where weakened connections have been linked with memory loss.

Researchers still aren't sure why this type of exercise appears to provide a boost to the brain, but studies suggest it has to do with increased blood flow, which provides our minds with fresh energy and oxygen.

And one recent study in older women who displayed potential symptoms of dementia found that aerobic exercise was linked with an increase in the size of the hippocampus, a brain area involved in learning and memory.

Joe Northey, the lead author of the British study and an exercise scientist at the University of Canberra, says his research suggests that anyone in good health over age 50 should do 45 minutes to an hour of aerobic exercise ""on as many days of the week as feasible"".

325,No.,http://www.pcgamer.com/are-wifi-signals-bad-for-my-health/,"Yes, we know that the idea of radio waves permeating through your residence does engender everything from concerns of inducing headaches, to increases in cancer, and even mind control. This is all enough for a select few to put on their tin foil hats, and move to Green Bank, West Virginia, the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) where all wireless transmissions are tightly controlled to facilitate scientific research. However, before we toss out our routers and pack our bags, let’s look at this a little more objectively.

The concerns go back over decade, and the potential disease was termed Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS). While not specific to wifi, individuals claimed vague symptoms to any source of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, and cellphone transmissions. The symptoms of EHS are all nonspecific, and included headaches, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, fatigue, tiredness and tingling. It should be realized that among medical professionals, this is currently not an accepted diagnosis, and currently has no treatment.

The very use of the term radiation brings up concern for health. However realize that WiFi is a non-ionizing radiation, as opposed to the ionizing radiation that is associated with nuclear plants, and X-rays. Furthermore, WiFi is closely regulated by the government, and devices have to comply to the low transmission standards of 100 milliwatts, which is why the range is quite limited.

Rather than sitting next to our wireless router, and waiting for a headache, we decided to peruse the medical literature for an answer to how real any potential health concerns from WiFi.

Research in this area gets done with “Sham WiFi,” where willing subjects are told they are being exposed to WiFi, which in some cases they are, and in other cases they are not. Researchers then look for a correlation to see if the symptoms of EHS can be associated with the actual WiFi exposure. Across multiple studies, including a review of thirty-one studies in this area published in Electromagnetics , there was no clear correlation found.

This leaves us wondering what is really going on here. It appears that this is a version of the “placebo effect,” with suggestible folks being convinced of the health detriments of wireless signals, but not confirmed by scientific research. Another study that came out this earlier this year suggests that media reports of potential symptoms from Wi-Fi may prime folks to develop these symptoms.

So, the bottom line on this is that there is no scientific evidence to support symptoms from WiFi. Therefore, cancel your travel plans to the NRQZ, put that tin foil hat back in the drawer, and keep using the wireless router.

326,"Trump: ""Send someone into space in 2019 instead of 2021 like you planned.""

NASA: ""No.""

",http://www.iflscience.com/space/nasa-wont-launch-humans-to-space-in-trumps-first-term/,"NASA has reaffirmed that it will not launch humans into space again until 2021, after the Trump administration asked them to look into bringing it forward to 2019.

The agency is currently developing its huge new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which will be used to one day launch astronauts to Mars.

In 2019, NASA is planning to launch the rocket for the first time with an unmanned Orion spacecraft on top, known as Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1), on a three-week mission around the Moon and back. A manned flight is scheduled to follow in 2021, called Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2).

However, the Trump administration had asked if NASA would consider putting a crew on the first flight – which would put it in Trump's first term. NASA looked into this, and has come back with a firm “no”.

“After evaluating cost, risk, and technical factors in a project of this magnitude, it is difficult to accommodate changes needed for a crewed EM-1 mission at this time,” NASA’s acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot, told employees in an email seen by The Verge.

In a press conference on Friday, Lightfoot said it would cost between $600 million and $900 million to put a two-person crew on EM-1. That’s because the spacecraft would need to be upgraded with life support systems, a launch abort system, and more.

“It really reaffirmed the baseline plan we had in place was the best way for us to go,” he said. “Leave EM-1 uncrewed.”

The Orion capsule will be used to launch and land astronauts. NASA

Trump had previously joked about the possibility of sending humans to Mars by 2024, so that it would take place in his potential second term (shudder). That has not really been taken seriously though, with the idea very much off the table.

“They have not asked us to go to Mars by 2024,” Lightfoot said in the press conference.

EM-1 has had a few problems so far, having been pushed back from 2018 to 2019 recently. And part of the rocket was damaged last week when it was accidentally dropped.

Once it does get up and running, though, the SLS will be the most powerful rocket in operation. And it will eventually eclipse the most powerful rocket of all time, the Saturn V.

This first launch is known as Block 1, and has a lifting capability of 70,000 kilograms (154,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit. Block 2, a bigger version of the SLS, will be able to carry 130,000 kilograms (287,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit.

Of course, this is not the only heavy-lift rocket in development. SpaceX is developing its Falcon Heavy rocket, which it intends to use to send humans around the Moon in 2018 and also for unmanned missions to Mars starting in 2020.

And SpaceX and Boeing will start launching astronauts to space, some for NASA, as early as next year.",2017-05-15 09:55:49

It was completely unnecessary and probably made it worse. A new study has found that simply applying vinegar to the sting, followed by heat, is the best solution regardless of what species has stung you, going against decades of first aid procedures.

The current protocols recommended for stings by the man o’ war jellyfish (Physalia physalis), and its closely related counterpart, the bluebottle (Physalia utriculus), involve washing the affected area with salt water before scraping away the tentacles and applying an ice pack, in order to lessen the impact of the sting. It turns out that this is just about the worst thing you could do.

The process of scraping away tentacles has been found to apply more pressure to the area, which increased the firing of stinging capsules, meaning more venom was injected. Washing in salt water was found to spread the sting over the skin, increasing the area of skin that is actually stung. Adding ice packs to the region just made the pain even worse, reports a new study published in the journal Toxins.

Instead, the researchers found that the general treatment recommended for all other jellyfish stings, namely dowsing the affected area in vinegar, was equally as effective for man o’ wars. Not only that, but the researchers claim that the addition of heat to the stung skin – around 45 minutes of 45°C water or a heat pad – effectively inactivated the venom that had already been injected.

It has long been thought that species of jellyfish belonging to Physalia, which are not technically jellyfish but actually a colony of zooids, require different treatment to the blanket first aid practices recommended for true jellies. Yet after looking at why doctors recommend salt water and ice, and other old wives tale remedies that have risen up, such as lemon juice, shaving foam, and the infamous pee, researchers from Hawaii and Ireland could find no real evidence to back the claims up.

“Without solid science to back up medical practices, we have ended up with conflicting official recommendations around the world, leading to confusion and, in many cases, practices that actually worsen stings or even cost lives,” explained Angel Yanagihara, the senior author of the paper. To test the effectiveness of various treatments, the researchers used sheep and human blood cells in agar.

The research was carried out using the same methods as an earlier study looking into box jellyfish, and will now use it again to test lion’s mane jellies, to see if the same treatment really does hold true over a wide range of species.",2017-05-11 12:31:21
329,Higher production of innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) due to lower levels of testosterone. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/why-women-are-more-likely-to-get-asthma-than-men/,"She may look suspiciously at the pollen-producing tree, but it's not just making her life a misery, it's engaging in sexual descrimination while it does it. Nicoleta Ionescu/Shutterstock

Last year, Melbourne, Australia, experienced an unprecedented “thunderstorm asthma” event. Some 10,000 people were rushed to the hospital, struggling to breathe, with at least nine deaths. No breakdown has been published, but if this resembled most other such events, two-thirds of those affected were women. Adult women are roughly twice as likely to suffer asthma as men, even though boys get it more frequently than girls. Now, a research institution based in the heart of Melbourne has laid the blame for this difference with testosterone.

The hormone testosterone gets blamed, or credited, with all sorts of differences between men and women, often falsely. However, Dr Cyril Seillet and colleagues at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute found it also plays an unexpected role in asthma.

In the Journal of Experimental Medicine, the researchers report that testosterone suppresses the production of innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Since ILC2s can react to pollen, dust mites, or cigarette smoke by producing inflammatory proteins that trigger asthma attacks, the reduction in these cells that men experience after puberty makes them less likely to suffer the attacks. “In males, you have less ILC2s in the lungs and this directly correlates with the reduced severity of asthma,"" Seillet said in a statement.

The discovery makes finding other ways to suppress ILC2s a natural line of research to tackle the rising rates of asthma. ""Current treatments for severe asthma, such as steroids, are very broad based and can have significant side effects,"" said co-author Professor Gabrielle Belz.

Seillet told IFLScience the researchers are looking for compounds that modulate ILC2s without the effects testosterone has on other tissues in the body. He said that a number of molecules already used for other purposes have potential, and testing is underway.

Naturally, ILC2s would not have survived in the body if their effects were entirely negative, and their reaction to dust mites gives a hint of their evolutionary function. Seillet told IFLScience they have an important role in protecting against parasite infections, as well as having an influence on obesity. Theoretically, it might be expected that men's lower ILC2 production would increase vulnerability to parasites, but Seillet said this has yet to be investigated.

Seillet added that ILC2s and testosterone are not the whole story when it comes to explaining asthma. “Asthma is multifactorial,” he told IFLScience. “It is triggered by environmental cues and influenced by genetic background.” However, Seillet and his colleagues investigated the difference observed between rates in men and women, for which testosterone's influence on ILC2s proved explanatory.",2017-05-11 10:00:00

The world's most popular password is the disappointingly easy-to-guess 123456, according to a massive analysis of 10 million leaked passwords.

Throughout 2016, we saw numerous major data breaches leaking people's login details online. Some were new — like the hack of adult dating site AdultFriendFinder — while others, like LinkedIn, were years-old, but the data only recently surfaced online.

In both cases, these breaches have provided researchers with an unparalleled look at the security habits of millions of people — and it's not pretty.

Security firm Keeper trawled through 10 million records that leaked in 2016, and found that a shocking 17% of people used the basic, insecure password 123456. (We heard about the analysis via The Register.)

In second place was the barely better 123456789, followed by the predictable qwerty. Then came 12345678, and in fifth place was the insecure 111111.

""Looking at the list of 2016’s most common passwords, we couldn’t stop shaking our heads,"" the researchers wrote in a blog post. ""Four of the top 10 passwords on the list — and seven of the top 15 — are six characters or shorter. This is stunning in light of the fact that, as we’ve reported, today’s brute-force cracking software and hardware can unscramble those passwords in seconds. Website operators that permit such flimsy protection are either reckless or lazy.""

What's more, Keeper says, recommendations about good security practices are just failing to get through to a lot of people.

""The list of most-frequently used passwords has changed little over the past few years,"" it writes. ""That means that user education has limits. While it’s important for users to be aware of risks, a sizable minority are never going to take the time or effort to protect themselves. IT administrators and website operators must do the job for them.""

Longer passwords can be harder to remember. But that's not an excuse to just use qwerty. Security experts recommend that people use a different, strong password for each service or website they have an account with, storing them with a password manager app if necessary. That way, if one service you used is breached, your accounts on others aren't compromised as well.

And you should also activate two-factor authentication whenever possible, so that even if your password is exposed, attackers still can't get into your account without access to your phone.

On a long enough timescale, everyone gets hacked. But by not using — and re-using — weak passwords, you can limit the damage.

Finally, here's the full list. If any of your passwords are on here, change them immediately.

332,"They are referred to as ""printer color blocks."" They identify which colors of ink are used in the package design. ",http://mentalfloss.com/article/51286/what-are-colored-circles-food-packages,"There's a lot of information crammed onto food packaging these days, and along with all of the helpful stuff (like nutritional data and ingredients), there's also the mysterious, multicolored row of circles or squares that serves a very important purpose ... for the printer.

Referred to as “printer's color blocks” or “process control patches,” this grid of color swatches indicates which hues of ink were used to produce the design on the package. The printer checks these colored circles or squares to determine whether a package conforms to the necessary color scheme for the product. In the case of any problems, the color blocks let both the human and computerized printers know if a deficiency (or surplus) of color caused the issue.

The color blocks are usually pictured as circles on most bagged products and squares on boxed goods, with the most common being black, cyan, magenta, and yellow, since they're the basis of most colors produced by printers. If the bulk of the package is printed in one or two other colors, they'll usually turn up in their own blocks (called “spot colors”), too. Bags of Cheetos, for example, will almost always have at least one orange block, but usually two or more in different hues.

If you don't see a set of color blocks on your bag of chips or box of cookies, you don't need to worry. The decision to include this element is an option, not a rule—though most large-scale, mass-produced products have some variation of color blocks on their packages. Some companies also crop off the color blocks during the packaging process.

Oh, and if you see the color blocks, you'll probably find a symbol that looks like the cross-hairs of a rifle scope somewhere on the package, too. These “register marks” (or “position marks”) are used to align all of the colors printed on the packaging—yet another helpful tool for the printer, but not really of any use to consumers.",2017-05-09 09:46:31
333,Yes. ,http://mentalfloss.com/article/500682/do-we-really-need-wash-our-hands,"Humans have a host of invisible companions: trillions of microbes, which live both inside of us and on us. Don't run to the shower just yet—keep in mind that some of these microbes may actually be your friends.

Contrary to popular belief, microbes don’t always cause disease. As Gross Science host Anna Rothschild explains in the video below, some healthy strains of skin bacteria may actually kill certain disease-causing bacteria, or train our immune systems to fight off future infections. Which makes us wonder, if some microbes are good for us, should we stop washing our hands?

The answer is “absolutely not.” Thanks to antibiotics, modern industrial living, and changes in diet, we’ve lost many of the beneficial microbes that may have become part of our immune systems during our early evolution. As such, this has opened us up to some of the less helpful ones, which can actually make us sick.

Since everyone gets a little dirty from time to time, scientists suggest practicing “targeted hygiene,” where we focus on our biggest germ targets. Since we use our hands to interact with people, animals, and nature, they are, understandably, pretty germy. So we should wash them often—and thoroughly—in order to prevent the spread of illness.

Because the jury is still out on which microbes are good or bad for us, it's best to err on the safe side by adopting this World Health Organization-endorsed six-step hand washing technique.",2017-05-08 08:45:00

The momma puppy is a chocolate lab, and was two years old when she gave birth to a 5-puppy litter. You'd expect five little normal lab puppies to come out.

Well, technically what happened. But one of the puppies still gave everyone a shock. Have you spotted it yet?

Nope, the resolution on your monitor isn't wrong. Her owners were shocked - being the only girl in the litter wasn't enough for this little one apparently!

That little pup is actually green! Now you know why everyone was so surprised.

After getting over the shock, her owners named her Fiona - like the princess/ogre from Shrek. So fitting! Here are some pictures of Fiona:

But why is her color green? Keep reading to find out what everyone is saying.

One theory as to why they're green comes from Time , who say that it may be because of an over-exposure to biliverdin, which is a green pigment in the placenta.

Thankfully, according to Life with Dogs , it's not a health concern at all. Kind of sad, but it fades after a few weeks. But Fiona will always be known as the green pup!

335,It's an invasive species called giant hogweed. Its sap causes horrible blisters. Snopes and other details in comments. ,http://realfarmacy.com/dont-touch-plant/,"They should teach this in school but unfortunately just like most important life skills it is up to us to educate our children and each other so make sure you SHARE this! The plant is called giant hogweed and the pretty white flowers can be quite alluring, but whatever you do make no mistake touching it!

Kids are especially in danger due to curiosity.

This might come as a surprise, but there are only about 10 plants in North America (not including fungi) that kids need to know to steer clear of. Currently, kids are too busy preparing for and taking tests, something nations excelling at education such as Finland don’t do (source), rather than learning practical knowledge such as how to identify poison oak or worse, hogweed!

So spread the word and teach your kids. Here’s what you should know:

Interestingly, the giant hogweed is part of the Carrot family and can grow up to 14 ft tall loaded with deadly toxic sap!

The results of merely brushing up against it are horrifying. If you accidentally break a stem or touch any of the sap you will begin to develop grotesque blisters! Due to the height of the stalk this is easy to accidentally do. Characteristics to watch out for include green stems with purple patches that are a bit hairy with white hairs.

According to Ask a Prepper:

If you come into contact with the plant’s sap you can expect severe blistering, possible blindness if it comes into contact with your eyes and possible third degree burns. These effects come from the type of chemicals that it contains. When these chemicals come in contact with human skin they dramatically increase the skin’s sensitivity to light.

This can cause blisters that are actually very painful and form within around 48 hours and can last from anywhere between a few months to six years. It can cause LONG TERM sensitivity to light if the sap gets in the eye.

Measures to Take if You or Your Child Comes in Contact With It

Obviously you want to avoid it in the first place but what if you happen to come in contact with giant hogweed?

Immediately wash the affected area with cold water. Make haste because the toxic reaction may begin within only 15 minutes and make sure you get out of the sun!

Apply a safe sunscreen on the effected area ASAP. It’s always good to have some of this excellent DIY recipe on hand just in case.

In the unfortunate event that the sap comes in contact with your eyes, immediately flush with water extensively. Then be sure to wear sunglasses for protection!

Recently some states made public warnings after these plants were spotted. The Blaze reported:

In recent weeks, New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation and the state of Massachusetts have issued detailed public warnings about the plant and the serious problems caused by coming in contact with it. These two states are not alone. In the northeastern region, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine are all reporting sightings of the plant. Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan are sending out warnings. Out west, Oregon and Washington have seen giant hogweed spreading.

How to Get Rid Of It

If you do spot it you have the option to report it to the EPA (US Environmental Protection Agency) hotline – 1-800-424-8802or your individual state agency as suggested. Officials warn not to remove the plant yourself or may risk spreading seeds.

""Hypoallergenic"" products are popular for their perceived skin benefits.

But the definition of ""hypoallergenic"" is not standardized or regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration.

The term can mean whatever manufacturers want it to mean.

And research shows some ""hypoallergenic"" products actually contain allergens.

People with skin allergies probably trust that ""hypoallergenic"" products will be free of ingredients that cause itchy, painful reactions. So they might be surprised to learn that the term ""hypoallergenic"" is essentially meaningless.

You don't have to take our word for it — take the US Food and Drug Administration's.

""There are no federal standards or definitions that govern the use of the term 'hypoallergenic,'"" the FDA writes on its website. ""The term means whatever a particular company wants it to mean.""

And it might not mean much.

In a 2015 study, for example, scientists tested 135 children's skin-care products labeled ""hypoallergenic"" and found that almost 90% contained at least one known skin allergen.

In an April 1978 issue of its ""FDA Consumer"" magazine, the agency explained that it did try to regulate the term during the 1970s. The agency wanted to allow the use of ""hypoallergenic"" only if human studies showed a product caused a significantly lower rate of allergic reactions compared to other products. But cosmetic companies fought the FDA in court and won. To this day, ""hypoallergenic"" is still unregulated, and manufacturers don't have to offer the FDA any proof to back up the claim.

This doesn't mean that all companies who use the term are trying to deceive you. Some might voluntarily put their products through a barrage of high-quality allergy testing, but it's hard to know that when you're browsing store shelves in search of a new product. In the drugstore, when you see the term on two different products, it could mean two totally different things.

The bottom line: Don't assume that ""hypoallergenic"" products will never cause an allergic reaction. If you see a company using the marketing term, you might want to check their website or contact customer service and see if they have additional information on their interpretation of its meaning.

337,“A right triangle has a hypotenuse equal to 10 and an altitude to the hypotenuse equal to 6. Find the area of the triangle.” ,http://www.iflscience.com/brain/microsoft-interview-question-crazily-difficult/,"If you're going for an interview at one of the world’s top tech companies, you need to know your stuff. Google’s now-banned interview questions have become the stuff of Internet folklore. But now, a former interviewee of Microsoft has revealed a question he was asked after applying for a job at the multi-billion dollar company. According to his story, their selection process is no more forgiving than Google's.

Prashant Bagdia posted on the website Quora the story of his friend who went for a job interview at Microsoft. For the last question, the interviewer asked: “A right triangle has a hypotenuse equal to 10 and an altitude to the hypotenuse equal to 6. Find the area of the triangle.”

Partly wondering why a software employer would be interested in a high school geometry question and partly wondering if this was a trick, the interviewee finally managed to piece together an answer he thought was correct, saying: “Sir, as area of any triangle is 0.5*base*height, the answer to this question would be 0.5 *10*6 which evaluates to 30!”

But his confident response was shut down by the interviewer. He was offered another chance to think about the question, but he stuck to his guns and was quickly told his answer was incorrect.

So why would they ask such a question? Well, rather deviously, a triangle with those measurements can’t exist.

As Prashant explains in his post , if the altitude is at a 45-degree angle and the hypotenuse is 10, then the largest the altitude can be is 5, as any higher altitude can’t exist in a right-angled triangle.

338,Altruism. ,http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/one-quality-in-men-might-be-even-more-attractive-than-good-looks-and-a-sense-of-humor/,"Most people would think that if it's not good looks that make a man most attractive to women, then it's definitely a sense of humor.

But studies consistently show that altruism is a top quality women are drawn to when they are looking for a relationship.

And a new study in the British Journal of Psychology found that altruistic men may have more sex, too.

The researchers asked unmarried Canadian adults how much they did good deeds like giving money to charity or helping someone get their car out of the snow. They then asked the participants how often they had sex and how many partners they've had.

Men who reported more altruistic acts had more sex — and more partners. For those who were in relationships, good-hearted men were more likely to have had more sex in the last 30 days, too.

In the second experiment of the study, the researchers had undergraduate students say whether they would like to donate money that they might receive for participating to charity. Those who said that they would also tended to have more casual sex, more sex in relationships, and more lifetime sex partners overall.

Another study, published in January 2016 in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, presented 202 women with different men to choose from. The different combinations of choices were either attractive or not, and they either did a good deed or didn't.

The women chose the selfish, attractive men for a one-night stand. But for a long-term relationship, they chose the altruistic man whether he was attractive or not.

A slightly older study, published in The Journal of Social Psychology in 2013, really drives this home. That study found that women valued altruism above other traits as a measure of whether a potential mate would make a good parent. The women also said that altruism was important for short-term relationships, but significantly more women said that the trait mattered for the long term.

Yet another study, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in July 2015, analyzed Germans' responses to a large annual survey.",2017-05-06 07:50:05
339,Planks. ,http://buff.ly/2pa07uj,"The INSIDER Summary:

Most people think sit-ups and crunches will give you a 6 pack.

Harvard doctors say that planks are far more effective.

Planks engage way more core muscles than crunches do.

If you think sit-ups are the quickest ticket to 6-pack abs, the physicians at Harvard Medical School have news for you: That classic exercise isn't as efficient as it seems.

Instead of crunches, they suggest doing planks, the exercise that involves holding yourself on your hands and toes in a pre-push-up position. The findings are detailed in a Harvard Medical School health report called ""Core Exercises.""

As opposed to sit-ups, which target only your abdominal muscles, planks recruit several groups of muscles along your sides, front, and back. If you want a strong core — especially the kind that would give you 6-pack-like definition across your abs — you need to challenge all of these muscles.

""Sit-ups or crunches strengthen just a few muscle groups,"" write the authors of the Harvard Healthbeat newsletter, which summarizes the report's key takeaways. ""Through dynamic patterns of movement, a good core workout helps strengthen the entire set of core muscles you use every day.""

Shutterstock

Conventional crunches may also be hard on different parts of your body, including your back, which gets pushed against the floor. Additionally, when you pull your body up into a sit-up position, you're working a group of muscles called the hip flexors which run from your thighs to the lumbar vertebrae in your lower back. When these muscles get too tight or become overly-strengthened, they can yank on your lower spine . This can cause pain or discomfort in your lower back.

And unlike ab-crunch machines, planks don't require a single piece of equipment, so you can do them anywhere.

Ready to give them a try?

The folks at Health.com recommend starting out by lying face-down with your legs extended and your elbows bent, directly under your shoulders, with your hands clasped. Your feet should be hip-width apart; your elbows should be shoulder-width apart. Next, tighten your abs and tuck your toes to elevate your body, keeping your forearms on the ground. Your body should be in a straight line from your head to your heels. To start, hold it for one minute.

As you get stronger, you can gradually build up to maintain the position for longer periods of time, and extend your arms to hold yourself up on your palms.

340,Contempt (a mix of anger and disgust). ,http://www.thisisinsider.com/behavior-thats-the-kiss-of-death-for-a-relationship-2016-1?utm_content=bufferdee4f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer,"The INSIDER Summary:

• Contempt is the most toxic behavior in a relationship.

• Researchers find it so powerful that they can use it — along with other negative behaviors — to predict divorce with 93% accuracy.





On the way home from work you have every intention of greeting your partner with a friendly ""Hi, how are you? How was your day?"" and listening attentively while he or she tells you all about it.

But the minute you open the door and drop your keys on the counter, you find yourself knee-deep in an argument about how he or she bought the wrong type of pepper.

Don't worry: It's perfectly normal to get into arguments like these with your significant other every once in a while, John Gottman, a psychologist at the University of Washington and founder of the Gottman Institute, told Business Insider.

It's what happens next that you need to watch out for, he says.

When you express your frustration over the pepper mix-up, do you listen while he explains that perhaps you didn't ever tell him what type of pepper you wanted? Do you think this over, and, when you realize that maybe he's right, do you apologize? Or do you adopt an attitude and think to yourself, ""What kind of an idiot doesn't know that bell peppers are for stir-fry and habaneros are for salsa?""

If you find yourself in the second situation, you're likely displaying contempt for your partner, and it could be putting your relationship in jeopardy.

Contempt, a virulent mix of anger and disgust, is far more toxic than simple frustration or negativity. It involves seeing your partner as beneath you, rather than as an equal.

Associated Press

Gottman and University of California at Berkeley psychologist Robert Levenson found this single behavior is so powerful that they can use it — along with the negative behaviors of criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling — to predict divorce with 93% accuracy

""Contempt,"" says Gottman, ""is the kiss of death.""

The striking 93% figure comes from a 14-year study of 79 couples living across the US Midwest (21 of whom divorced during the study period) published in 2002. Since then, decades of research into marriage and divorce have lent further support to the idea linking divorce with specific negative behaviors.

One recent study of 373 newlywed couples, for example, found that couples who yelled at each other, showed contempt for each other, or simply began to disengage from conflict within the first year of marriage were more likely to divorce, even as far as 16 years down the road.

Why are couples who exhibit this one behavior more likely to split up?

It comes down to a superiority complex.

Feeling smarter than, better than, or more sensitive than your significant other means you're not only less likely see his or her opinions as valid, but, more importantly, you're far less willing to try to put yourself in his or her shoes to try to see a situation from his or her perspective.

Picture a resonance chamber, suggests Gottman, with each person in the relationship a source of his or her own musical (or emotional) vibrations. If each partner is closed off to the other person's vibes (or emotions) and more interested in unleashing their own feelings of disgust and superiority, these negative vibrations will resound against one another, escalating a bad situation ""until something breaks,"" Gottman says.

If you've noticed yourself or your partner exhibiting this type of behavior, don't despair — it doesn't mean your relationship is doomed.

Being aware that you're doing something that could negatively affect your partner is the first step to actively combating it. If you can figure out how to avoid the behavior or replace it with a more positive one, you'll likely greatly improve the relationship — and increase your chances of staying together for longer.

Too much caffeine decreases the absorption of magnesium and B vitamins.

These deficiencies can result in a hormone imbalance.

You'll feel more energized by feeding your hormones properly than by guzzling caffeine.



Alisa Vitti is a functional nutritionist who runs a company called FLOLiving. She created an app called MyFLO to help women understand and naturally manage their periods. She's written a bestselling book called ""WomanCode."" She has a toddler at home. And she hasn't had a drop of caffeine in 20 years.

Vitti's philosophy for healthy living revolves around eating the right foods at the right times according to one's hormonal cycle and cutting out foods that set off hormonal dysfunction — like caffeine.

Coffee might give you a boost of energy now, but it slows you down in the long run. Caleb George/Unsplash

Hormone imbalance symptoms can include painful menstrual cramps, weight gain, trouble sleeping, constant fatigue, and mood swings. After Vitti was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) at the age of 20, she alleviated her symptoms naturally through changing her diet. Now, she wants to help others do the same.

According to Vitti, cutting out caffeine is a simple step that can make an enormous difference.

""Just nixing caffeine alone will stop you from depleting essential magnesium and B vitamin stores that are water soluble that caffeine forces you to flush out at higher concentration,"" she told INSIDER. ""Those two micronutrient deficiencies alone can kick off an entire hormonal imbalance and set you down the road of problems. If you just cut out the caffeine as one thing, you will feel dramatically better with your next cycle.""

Her FLOLiving program includes a caffeine step-down plan to wean addicts off of their daily fix.

""It should be a controlled substance, in my opinion,"" she said. ""It's very telling that there's a coffee shop on every corner — it's very addicting. Couple that with sugar and you're now stimulating two very powerful addiction centers in the body. It quickly runs people out of hormonal balance very easily.""

Instead of coffee, Vitti swears by other hot beverages like rooibos tea lattes that provide the same kind of ritual without the disruptive affects.

""You get more energized by feeding your hormones properly than you do by triaging your fatigue with caffeine,"" she said. ""The earlier you get off it, the better.""",2017-05-04 11:16:58

And so, when the time is right and they decide to start trying for a baby, they typically figure that they'll get pregnant right away.

But in reality, most couples don't conceive immediately after they start trying, according to Dr. Shruti Malik from Shady Grove Fertility in Virginia.

""Most couples will conceive in about six months or less,"" Malik told INSIDER. ""So it's interesting, because I have a lot of patients who spent a good portion of their adolescence trying to prevent pregnancy, and then later find out that it's more difficult than one would necessarily presume.""

The fertility expert explained that couples who have no history of infertility, and are having regular unprotected sex, have a 15% to 20% chance of conceiving per cycle.

""So if you were to consider all of those, if you have six cycles of doing that, most couples will conceive in that six-month window,"" Malik said.

However, if a couple has been having regular unprotected intercourse without getting pregnant for 12 months, it is recommended that they either seek a fertility consultation to get more information, or consider treatment for possible infertility.

""If she has not conceived in that window, there is a higher likelihood that there may be other factors that are contributing to that couple's difficulty in conceiving. And at that point in time, it warrants seeing a physician or fertility specialist,"" Malik explained.",2017-05-03 16:49:18

But at Yaya’s, a Thai restaurant in San Antonio, Texas, the owners have taken things one step further.

A Reddit user name Joshua_Glock first first posted Yaya’s Wi-Fi code this weekend, and since then, no one has successfully connected to the restaurant’s network. While businesses boasting clever Wi-Fi passcodes aren’t anything new (earlier this year, a Chinese restaurant made headlines after it made customers solve an equation to figure out its menu prices), the equation is proving impossible to solve, and subsequently driving Redditors to the brink of madness.

Over the course of the last four days, some 400 users have responded to Joshua_Glock’s plea for help. While many comments accused the restaurant of trolling its customers, some earnestly tried to either solve or find the flaw in the intricate equation.

“This looks a lot like a summation of a binomial probability density function. I strongly doubt the divider between N/m should even be there,” one user wrote. “Given the mistakes, it looks like something written by someone who doesn't understand what they're doing,” added another.

Sure, it’s possible that Yaya’s version Will Hunting made a simple mistake on the proverbial chalkboard. But what might be more probably is that a disgruntled employee got tired of being asked for the restaurant’s Wi-Fi password, Googled “impossible math equation,” and kicked back while waiting for the frenzy to ensue.

But as Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy explains in a recent Big Think video, the average person will probably find more success (and happiness) if they shoot for just down the block — at least at first.

The biggest mistake a lot of people make in setting goals for themselves, Cuddy says, is that they focus only on the outcome, not the process.

Cuddy is an expert on human behavior and the author of ""Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges."" She's conducted loads of research into tiny triggers that cause us to either take pride in our accomplishments or look back on our failings with regret and disappointment.

She's found that people often get down on themselves because of unrealistic or poorly planned goals.

""They're so big. They're so distant,"" Cuddy says of moonshots such as losing 40 pounds or getting a dream job. ""They require a million little steps in between, and each of those little steps is an opportunity to fail.""

The smarter approach is to learn to embrace the process.

On its face, that may seem counter-productive, like you're taking your eyes off the prize. But Cuddy emphasizes the power of using long-term thinking for short-term planning. You won't lose all the weight overnight, so your best option is to focus on making each day the best it can be. Chop up the big goal into a string of daily or weekly goals that are easier to accomplish.

""A lot of research is showing us that we do much better when we focus on incremental change, on little bits of improvement,"" Cuddy says.

That's how you go from a couch potato to a marathoner. You temporarily ignore the fact you need to run 26.2 miles several months from now, and focus only on running one mile today. And since that goal is much easier to achieve, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment once it's complete.

In turn, that creates the extra motivation you need to move onto a second and third run, and, ultimately, the race itself.

""Eventually, in aggregate, you get there,"" Cuddy says. ""You may not even realize it, until one day you turn around say 'Wow, this thing is much easier for me now than it was a year ago.'""",2017-05-02 17:35:31

346,60+ million years ago. ,https://www.seeker.com/a-chunk-of-india-and-eurasia-just-disappeared-2041404910.html,"Half of the mass of Eurasia and India is missing, new research finds, and may have been swallowed up by the Earth's mantle.

If so, that would be a surprise, as geoscientists thought that continental crust - the kind that makes up major landmasses - was too buoyant to dive down into the mantle, the pliable middle layer of the planet upon which the crust rides.

""It used to be thought that the mantle and the crust interacted only in a relatively minor way,"" study researcher David Rowley, a geoscientist at the University of Chicago, said in a statement. ""This work suggests that, at least in certain circumstances, that's not true."" [Photo Timeline: How the Earth Formed]

The mystery of the missing crust emerged as Rowley and his colleagues examined the slow-moving collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. These two rafts of continental crust have been bumping against each other for 60 million years, crumpling up to form the Himalayan mountains. The researchers combined multiple data sources to figure out the original size of the two continental plates before they started colliding.

These new calculations, published online Sept. 19 in the journal Nature Geoscience, revealed a strange imbalance. Even after accounting for the ruched bits of crust that climbed upward to form the Himalayas, the excess that squeezed out the sides to form southeast Asia, and the crust that eroded over 60 million years and ended up in the oceans, Rowley and his colleagues couldn't explain where half of the original mass of India and Eurasia went. [Earth's 8 Biggest Mysteries]

That led to an unprecedented conclusion.

""If we've accounted for all possible solutions at the surface, it means the remaining mass must have been recycled wholesale into the mantle,"" said study researcher Miquela Ingalls, a graduate student in geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago.

Unknown interactions

Continental crust isn't supposed to be able to sink in that way. Geoscientists have long known that dense oceanic crust can be ""recycled"" into the mantle - this is the geologic process that happens at subduction zones like the one off the coast of California. Oceanic crust slides under less dense continental crust like a conveyer belt and, under pressure, becomes ductile and gooey, mixing in with the mantle.

But because continental crust is so buoyant, researchers thought it acted more like a pool raft: Push it down, and it will just pop back up again.

The new research might cause researchers to re-evaluate that interaction and how it works. But the study also has the potential to explain some geochemical mysteries. For example, volcanic eruptions sometimes spew out elements like lead and uranium, which aren't very common in the mantle. These elements are pretty common in continental crust, however. If the India-Eurasia collision is representative, it might explain how these continental materials get recycled into the mantle and then erupt out again, Rowley said.

""The implication of our work is that, if we're seeing the India-Asia collision system as an ongoing process over Earth's history, there has been a continuous mixing of the continental crustal elements back into the mantle,"" he said.

A study has finally found the source of Antarctica's gruesome ""Blood Falls.""

It's been 106 years since Australian geologist Griffith Taylor discovered the vivid red falls flowing from the glacier named after him, onto the icy Lake Bonney.

It was originally thought to be caused by red algae, but it wasn't until 2003 that it was decided the red color came from oxidized iron and water most likely draining from a 5 million-year-old saltwater lake.

Now a study from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Colorado College confirms the glacier has not only a lake underneath it but also a water system that has been flowing for a million years.

The team used echolocation to track where the water flowed. The reason it has never frozen, they say, is a perpetual hydraulic system that sees the heat energy released by water freezing, in turn melting the surrounding ice.

348,No. ,http://www.inquisitr.com/3626660/is-peppa-pig-causing-autism-and-making-kids-lose-their-sense-of-empathy/,"Each Peppa Pig episode leaves kids laughing, but the charming pig is again under fire for being linked to autism and other long-term developmental issues. A new round of rumors have emerged that the well-loved show poses dangers to its young viewers.

The reports are based on a so-called 2012 research by epidemiologist Marc Wildemberg from Harvard University. Wildemberg claims that children who watch Peppa Pig for at least half an hour have 56 percent increased chances of having autism. While the alleged study already made headlines years ago, several media outlets have brought back the story.

Stories linking the British cartoon to developmental problems appear to be unfounded because according to some experts, searching for the epidemiologist on Google doesn't yield any credible information. It is possible that the reports were only fabricated in an attempt to discredit Peppa Pig.

It isn't the first time that Peppa Pig faced criticisms. In a previous interview with Courier Mail via Daily Mail, Dr. Karen Philip used Peppa Pig as an example of a cartoon that prevents kids from ""developing skills in empathy and reading other people's body language.""

She claims that children aged 4 to 5 get so used to watching the television that they fail to develop complete brain functions. Despite this, she reminds parents that the potentially harmful effects of television may be reversed if parents will allow their children to watch educational programs instead. Philip adds that something good can still come out from watching Peppa Pig.

""If parents interact with them during a show or if they want to watch, say Peppa Pig, and they're doing the singing and dancing and interacting, that's completely different.""

""Parents complain that their children copy Peppa's annoying behavior - behaving like a brat, burping and blowing raspberries all the time, and saying 'I don't want to play with you anymore' to their friends (just like Peppa does). That and they start jumping in muddy puddles all the time!""

Some believe that Peppa Pig contains sinister messages and portrays stereotypes. One example that parents cite is that Daddy Pig is the one who has an ""important job"" while Mommy Pig is the one who often goes around making tea. There are children who allegedly copy George's responses to food. When asked what they would love to have for breakfast, some kids would answer ""chocolate cake."" They would also say ""yuck"" when parents try to feed them vegetables.

On the other hand, Lifestyle One reports that many consider Peppa Pig to be educational. One mother, whose son has developmental delays, lauds the show.

""He now knows some things that we have never even mentioned to him, such as actions for Twinkle Twinkle Little Star… We have seen a massive improvement since he has been paying attention to the [show].""

Many insist that at the end of the day, it is the job of parents to limit their children's access to technology. There is no evidence yet that watching television indeed leads to autism, but studies advise that a child diagnosed as autistic must have limited access to the screen in order for him or her to have more meaningful pursuits. Cartoons, when carefully selected, can help children connect better with their peers.

349,"Tranexamic acid, a substance that helps blood clot more quickly. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/this-cheap-old-drug-can-save-thousands-of-new-mothers-from-bleeding-to-death,"A large international trial has showed that a cheap, readily available drug could save the lives of thousands of women each year who suffer from excessive bleeding after giving birth.

Even though childbirth is safer than ever, post-partum haemorrhage is still a major killer of new mums around the world, accounting for more than 100,000 deaths every year. But now the results are in on a drug that could help solve the problem.

A major study of 20,000 women in 21 countries has shown that a simple intravenous injection of tranexamic acid can prevent a third of the deaths caused by post-partum bleeding.

Tranexamic acid, which essentially helps blood clot more quickly, is not a new medicine. It was discovered by Japanese doctor Utako Okamoto back in the 1960s, when she was looking for something that could treat devastating bleeding after childbirth.

But at that time, she couldn't persuade any obstetricians to do a trial.

Now it is one of the medications available for women with heavy periods, and is used in different types of surgery to prevent excessive blood loss.

Large-scale trials have already shown that injections of tranexamic acid can prevent deaths from bleeding after accidents, and in 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) even added it to the list of essential medicines.

But until this latest trial, we still didn't have solid evidence on whether the drug would indeed be helpful for post-partum bleeding.

To test this hypothesis, in 2010 a research team led by scientists from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine embarked on a massive trial spanning six years and 21 countries on four continents.

Researchers randomly assigned women with clinically diagnosed post-birth bleeding to either receive a placebo or a tranexamic acid injection in addition to all the usual medical care their cases required.

The study was properly blinded - neither the patients nor the doctors administering the injection knew whether it contained the drug.

The researchers found that if tranexamic acid was injected within three hours after giving birth, it reduced deaths from post-birth bleeding by nearly one-third.

It also appears that it doesn't matter what the cause of the bleeding is, or even what type of birth the woman had - tranexamic acid is still effective, as long as it's given quickly.

These are some amazing results. If every woman who suffers life-threatening bleeding could receive this drug, it could save tens of thousands of lives every year.

Scientists are now looking at new ways to make the drug easy to administer. It's even possible that for women who are at higher risk, a tablet could be given before birth.

This is especially relevant in many African countries, where women often don't get timely treatment for pregnancy-related anemia.

""Half the women giving birth there start off with roughly half the red blood cells they should have,"" one of the researchers, Ian Roberts, told Donald G. McNeil at The New York Times.

""Doctors are forced to throw in everything they've got, because they know the woman can be dead in an hour.""

Currently, the WHO guidelines for the treatment of post-partum haemorrhage recommend injecting drugs that contract the uterus, such as oxytocin, in addition to massaging the uterus. The guidelines do mention tranexamic acid, but it's not a first-line treatment.

Now that we know its life-saving potential, those guidelines are ready for an update.

""Our results support the inclusion of tranexamic acid in WHO treatment guidelines for primary post-partum haemorrhage,"" the researchers write.

Tranexamic acid is available as a generic medication, and an injection can cost less than a dollar.

But researchers emphasise that in many low-income and middle-income countries, women die of post-partum bleeding at home, where nobody can quickly give them an intravenous injection.

Many of the patients in the trial whose deaths could not be prevented arrived at the hospital too late.

""We have to make sure tranexamic acid is available wherever a woman gives birth and is at risk,"" lead researcher Haleema Shakur told Sarah Boseley at The Guardian.

""We must make sure doctors and midwives are aware of the results of the study. And we need health ministers to make sure that the drug is available in their country and is on their shopping list of essential medicines.""

The trial was published in The Lancet.",2017-04-28 20:18:10

Local media have reported that a hickey (or chupetón) the teen received from his girlfriend caused a blood clot that in turn led to his fatal stroke.

Should you be worried about getting a blood clot from your next love bite?

No. You really should not. It’s not impossible that a hickey could cause a blood clot that leads to a stroke, but it’s incredibly unlikely, according to Charles Abrams, president of the American Society of Hematology and a hematologist at the University of Pennsylvania. It could happen if a person’s blood vessels are torn during the chomp. “But I think that would be pretty hard to do,” he says.

Blood clots can form both in veins, which carry blood to your heart, and in arteries, which are more muscular and carry blood away from it. Clots are more likely to form when blood flow is sluggish, and can be related to a variety of different conditions.

If a clot forms or becomes lodged in an artery, it can cut off blood flow to the heart or part of the brain, causing a heart attack or a stroke. This is typically caused by atherosclerosis—in which plaques of fat and cholesterol build up in the arteries, making them harder and narrower—rather than an injury.

It’s more common for injuries to cause blood clots to form in a vein. “I’m very surprised that a hickey could actually do this,” Abrams says. “It has to be real trauma in order to cause an arterial clot, probably much more significant than the trauma that it takes to form a clot in a vein.”

This is not the only report of a love bite apparently causing a blood clot and stroke. In 2010, the New Zealand Medical Journal described the case of a 44-year-old woman who experienced weakness in her arm several days after getting a hickey. She recovered after being treated with blood thinners. The physicians who wrote up her report described the incident as “an uncommon mode of blunt trauma” to the neck and carotid artery.

Blood clots in veins don’t typically cause strokes, but they can lead to deep vein thrombosis, aka the reason you should stretch your legs during a long flight. Clots that form in the deep veins of your legs, arms or torso can become lodged in the lungs, a dangerous situation called pulmonary embolism.

The odds of dying from a hickey-induced blood clot are vanishingly small. But venous blood clots kill more people than breast cancer, car crashes, and AIDS combined each year. “I’m struck by this hickey-associated clot, but I’m more concerned about the more common and real risk of having a clot in a vein,” Abrams says.",2017-04-28 17:14:22

If processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. Surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate.

“We propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system,” write graduate student Erica Schulte and Dr. Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan in PLOS ONE.

The authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as “loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so.” They back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist.

“Although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating,” the authors write.

To test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the Yale Food Addiction Scale, of which Gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors.",2017-04-09 16:28:02
352,It bypasses their brains and accumulates in their eyes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/something-weird-happens-give-cocaine-fish/,"Sometimes, in the name of science, you have to give cocaine to a fish. But when you do, be prepared for something a little strange to happen.

Researchers in Switzerland have recently discovered that when zebrafish are given the white stuff, it bypasses their brains and accumulates in their eyes. Though this might not sound like a world-changing revelation, it could actually have a major impact on the way that new medicines are studied in the future.

Despite the fact that zebrafish don’t have much in common with people, they are at least vertebrates, and therefore have a central nervous system that scientists can play around with and test all sorts of experimental drugs on. As such, they are often used as aquatic guinea pigs, particularly when researchers want to observe the effects of psychoactive substances that they don’t feel comfortable using on humans.

However, reporting their findings in the journal Toxicological Sciences, the study authors provide clear evidence that some drugs – in this case cocaine – do not have the same effect on zebrafish as they do on mammals. Indeed, cocaine primarily acts on the brain when taken by those of us who live on dry land, yet heads straight to the eyes in zebrafish. This means that any data obtained using fish may not in fact be relevant to humans, thereby ruling out the possibility of using certain marine species to study drugs.

To conduct their investigation, the team placed zebrafish larvae in tanks containing water contaminated with various amounts of cocaine, before using an imaging technique called Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry to observe where in their bodies the drug accumulated. Amazingly, they found that only a small amount ended up in the brain, although massive concentrations – sufficient to kill a person – built up in the eyes.

Though the researchers aren’t entirely sure why this is the case, they speculate that cocaine may have a chemical affinity for melanin, which is found in the eyes.

In contrast, when people take cocaine it acts on the brain, triggering the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, resulting in hyperactivity. Yet the drug has the exact opposite effect on zebrafish, causing them to become less active. The study authors suggest this is because it acts like an anaesthetic when it comes into contact with the skin, gills, and peripheral nervous system.

Study co-author Kristin Schirmer explained in a statement that “if we want to have a better knowledge of the effects of such chemicals on the ecosystem, we need a more detailed understanding of the processes of uptake through water – they’re quite different from when drugs are inhaled or injected.”",2017-04-08 23:17:08
353,Cancer. ,http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/health/cancer-mayo-survey-most-important-health-challenge/index.html,"Story highlights A new survey reveals what health care challenge concerns Americans the most Cancer surpasses obesity, Alzheimer's and infectious diseases as ""most important""

CNN —

What health condition concerns Americans the most? Cancer – more so than obesity, neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and even infectious diseases, such as Zika, Ebola and HIV/AIDS.

That’s just one of many findings about Americans’ opinions on health that emerged in the latest Mayo Clinic National Health Checkup survey results, released Tuesday.

The idea behind the survey was to simply “listen to our patients,” said Dr. John Wald, medical director for public affairs at the Mayo Clinic, who helped conduct the survey.

“This survey allows us to extend this same principle beyond the walls of our campuses to assess the current state of the American health consumer and to begin to define gaps and opportunities to better interact and educate these same consumers,” he said. “It is only through effective listening that you begin to define the best solutions.”

The survey was conducted July 28 through 31 and involved 1,008 adults nationwide.

The participants were asked questions via telephone about which health conditions they believed to be the “most important” health challenge in the country, how much progress modern medicine was making in treating those conditions, and which health care concerns would weigh into their decision for voting for a specific presidential candidate, among others.

The results revealed that a majority of the respondents – 37% – believed cancer to be the No. 1 most significant health care challenge in the country, followed by obesity as No. 2, neurological diseases as three, diabetes as four and heart disease as five. Infectious diseases were thought to be the least significant.

“Interestingly, only 3% viewed the Zika virus as a significant health care challenge,” Wald said.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but cancer comes in as a close second. About 84% of respondents said they would be interested in a vaccine to prevent cancer, if one existed.

More people living in the West (21%) than in the South (13%), Northeast (10%) or Midwest (8%) said they would not be interested in a cancer vaccine.

Most respondents – 38% – considered brain cancer to be the “scariest” type. About 20% of respondents said pancreatic was the most concerning type, 10% said lung, 8% said breast, 7% said prostate, 5% said colon, and 5% said skin.

“Cancer has always been a scary disease in American life, especially in the years when there was little one could do about it,” said Dr. Howard Markel, director of the University of Michigan Medical School’s Center for the History of Medicine, who was not involved in the new survey.

“Early in the 20th century well into the 1970s, people called it the ‘C-word’ and did not want to discuss it publicly. That has been changing in the past few decades, thanks to the host of wonderful advances in modern medicine, but serious cancer remains, well, serious. So I am not surprised,” he said of the survey results.

However, while respondents pointed to cancer as the most important health care challenge, 74% said that they believed some progress was being made to address it.

Most of the respondents – 83% – said some progress was being made in developing new treatments for heart disease, and fewer – 52% – said progress was being made with obesity.

Respondents also weighed in on their personal health in the survey. About 86% said they get headaches; 63% said their headaches are triggered by stress, 54% said by not eating and 41% said by not getting enough sleep.

About 72% of respondents defined a good night’s sleep as snoozing seven to eight hours, but nearly half – 49% – said they achieve that much shut-eye half the time or less, on average.

With the 2016 presidential election approaching in November, 95% of respondents said health care issues would weigh into their decision in voting for a specific candidate.

What influences their choice of a presidential candidate? About 79% said lowering health care costs, 78% said improving the quality of health care, 72% said improving access to health care, and 63% said increasing funding for medical research.

Although a survey of some 1,000 adults may not be representative of all Americans, asking questions about what concerns the country is important, said Philip Alcabes, professor of community health at Hunter College of the City University of New York, who was not involved in the new survey.

“Ideally, our health policy is based on both the evidence about what real threats to Americans’ health exist and also what Americans are truly most worried about. … So, it makes perfect sense to ask these questions,” Alcabes said.

“What’s interesting but not surprising about the Mayo Clinic survey is the intensity of concern about the delivery of health care services. The cost, quality of care, access to care,” he said. “I don’t know how representative this is, but those are concerns that we hear in so many forums and from so many sectors of society, so it’s not surprising that that’s what emerges from this survey also.”",2016-09-27 00:18:54
354,No. ,http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/doctor-are-we-over-vaccinating-small-children,"I’m not someone who writes about vaccinations. In fact, if I’m at a social event and two people begin to discuss argue about vaccinations, I quickly recall that I forgot something somewhere and excuse myself.

That said, one of my physician-friends recently shared an article from the Scientific Parent that touched on vaccinations.

In the piece, Dr. Alison Shuman, a California-based pediatrician, asks whether or not small children are being vaccinated “too much, too soon.” Shuman, Chair of Pediatrics at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, says that contrary to popular belief, children are actually being exposed to far fewer foreign agents than their parents and grandparents had as children.

We have refined and improved our vaccines so much that our children today are even safer than we were. So when you worry about exposing your children to so many “more” things, don’t worry, you aren’t! You are exposing them to fewer antigens than all of us got. If you are wondering how many antigens are in certain vaccines, the hepatitis B, diphtheria and tetanus vaccines each contain just one antigen.

Essentially, children are receiving more vaccinations but far fewer antigens in those vaccinations. Here's what she says:

When we were children (70s, 80s and early 90s) we were vaccinated against fewer things (which were nonetheless still deadly). Let’s take the CDC’s vaccine schedule from 1983 for example. There were seven diseases we were protected against including measles, mumps, rubella, (MMR), Diptheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) and polio. Because of how vaccines were made at the time, we were exposed to about 3,000 antigens by the time we were 12 months old and 12,000 by the time we were 4 if we got all of our vaccines.

Antigens are basically any foreign material designed to trigger or stimulate your immune system. In vaccinations, these “foreign invaders” are weakened so human immune systems can easily overcome them and learn how to defend itself from whatever virus or bacteria one is being immunized for.

According to Shuman and the below chart provided by Scientific Parent, advances in the field of medicine have allowed medical professionals to combat twice as many diseases with just a fraction of the antigens.

Will this end the debates on vaccinations? Of course not. Nor should it. Putting foreign agents into our children is serious stuff, and open, inquiring minds can help us better understand what we’re putting into their bodies and why we’re doing it.

I know many people out there are passionate about this issue and know much more about it than I do. So I ask: Did Shuman miss anything or get something wrong? Did she change your mind?

If, dear reader, you are now adorned with a doubt-infused frown, then you’ve probably clocked that this won’t be due to some apocalyptic shift in plate tectonics. Continental drift, however, does have a role to play in this geographic kerfuffle.

The Australian Plate is moving about 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) northwards every single year. This motion has accumulated over the decades to produce a significant discrepancy between local coordinates on maps and global coordinates in digital navigation systems used by satellites.

At present, this difference amounts to an error of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet). This is enough to cause a problem to anything in Australia that uses GPS-like systems, including smartphones and vehicles.

""If you want to start using driverless cars, accurate map information is fundamental,"" Dan Jaksa, a member of Geoscience Australia, told BBC News. “We have tractors in Australia starting to go around farms without a driver, and if the information about the farm doesn't line up with the coordinates coming out of the navigation system there will be problems.”

In order to stave off a grim future where autonomous tractors plough into helpless farm animals by mistake, the nation’s local coordinates will jump northwards at the start of next year. By 2020, the inexorable march of plate tectonics will catch up to the adjustment, and both the analogue and digital coordinate sets will match up for the first time since 1994, when the local coordinate system was last updated.

So as to stop this silliness happening again, a new as-of-yet unspecified system will be implemented in 2020 that will keep the two sets of coordinates matched in real-time. “Once we have a system that can deal with changes over time, then everybody in the world could be on that same system,” Jaksa added.

Australia was attached to Antarctica until around 85 million years ago, whereupon they began to initially rift apart. By 45 million years ago, 21 million years after the non-avian dinosaurs bit the dust, they had completely separated from each other. Although the Australian Plate initially fused with the Indian Plate, they have since become segregated, perhaps as little as 3 million years ago.

In 50 million years’ time, Australia will collide into the southeastern coast of China, eventually forming a brand new mountain range. It will be one of the earliest jigsaw pieces that will culminate in the formation of Pangaea Ultima, the next true supercontinent, 250 million years from now. By then, it’s likely that our coordinate technology would have moved on quite a bit.",2016-08-01 23:15:07

Researchers discovered less grey matter in the brains of men who regularly view pornography compared with those who don’t.

Experts say it’s the first evidence for a link between watching sexually explicit material and reductions in brain size – but the new study doesn’t prove that pornography causes changes to the brain.

They say an alternative explanation could be that men with a certain type of brain with overly-sensitive reward stimuli – known as the ‘striatum’ - could be more likely to use pornography.

Dr Simone Kühn from the Max Planck Institution in Berlin led the study. “Unfortunately we cannot answer this question based on the results of the present,” she said.

“It’s not clear, for example, whether watching porn leads to brain changes or whether people born with certain brain types watch more porn”.

Dr Kühn and colleagues from Berlin’s Charite University used 64 healthy men between the ages of 21 and 45 years and studied their porn-watching habits.

They matched their survey results with scans of the men’s brains and observed both the volume of the brain and the way they reacted to sexually explicit images.

The findings, published in the JAMA Psychiatry Journal, have been met with scepticism from some experts who say that watching pornography in moderation was probably not harmful.

Dr Gregory Tau from Columbia University said that porn-watching was “probably not terrible in moderation”.

“It is possible that there are individuals with a certain kind of brain that are more susceptible to these kinds of behaviours,” he said.

“Or, it’s possible it’s the excessive use (of porn) that’s perpetuating itself to causing brain changes. Or, it could be both.”

Dr Kühn has called for future studies to conduct deeper investigations into the effects of pornography on the brain over time.",2016-07-14 09:30:00

Hm.",http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-are-nipples-darker-than-the-rest-of-the-skin-a6808631.html,"Perhaps it’s not be up there with life’s most important questions – what is the meaning of it all, why are we here? – but don’t pretend you haven’t ever wondered why some parts of your body are different colours.

Why, for example, are our nipples and genitals different colours to the rest of us? And does this serve any purpose?

The answers appears to be no, a dermatologist recently explained.

Dr Lindsey Bordone, a dermatologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York told the Mail Online that the change is down to a combination of two things: melanin and hormones.

When a human hits puberty, the spike in oestrogen and testosterone caused the body to create melanin – the amino acid which also gives the colour to our hair.

This makes the penis, nipples, areolas, and labia turn darker a darker colour.

The phenomenon is also why children who have blonde hair become brunettes as they grow older.

A woman’s skin can also become darker during pregnancy for similar reason, particularly around the areolas. Moles and freckles often become a more intense shade, while fewer women will experience chloasma which affects the forehead, cheeks and neck.

But Dr Bordone warned that darker skin is also a symptom of diabetes.

This condition is known as acanthosis nigricans, according to the American Diabetes Association, and sees a person developing darker areas on the sides of the neck, armpits and groin.

359,Nope. ,http://thescienceexplorer.com/brain-and-body/explainer-there-any-science-behind-astrology,"Photo credit: pixabay.com

Looking at the star signs from a scientific standpoint.

A hospital in Argentina is reportedly using astrology to help treat some mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety, by giving patients an understanding of their astrological personalities. The guidance is given based on the patient’s sign — whether he or she is an Aries, Taurus, or so forth — and the leading astrologist develops a star chart for each patient.

Unsurprisingly, the astrology workshop is being met with criticism over its scientific validity.

Diego Andrés Golombek, a professor at the University of Quilmes in Argentina, told Quartz, “Astrology can be harmless, of course, unless it gives directions and instructions into how to proceed with, for example, an illness or medical treatment.”

SEE ALSO: 6 Questions to Ask Before Sharing Science on the Internet

“And, indeed, having such a program organized by a hospital leads into the completely false assumption that astrology might have some kind of scientific background which, of course, it completely lacks. I am horrified by this prospect!”

So, based on the evidence (or lack thereof), is there any real science to support astrology?

There are a few foundational ways to evaluate whether a concept is scientific, and the University of California, Berkeley’s Understanding Science website lays out a “Science checklist.”

1. Does astrology use testable ideas?

For something to have a true scientific basis, it has to encompass testable ideas. However, as Understanding Science explains, “Some expectations generated by astrology are so general that any outcome could be interpreted as fitting the expectations; if treated this way, astrology is not testable.”

2. Does it rely on evidence?

There haven’t been many studies that investigate the science behind astrology, but of the few that have, the results have failed to support the validity of astrological views. For instance, a study tested the accuracy of astrological charts in describing the personality traits of 193 study participants, and the results indicated that the scores were at a level consistent with chance.

So far, it can’t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence — and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself as valid.

3. Does it attempt to explain the natural world?

Yes, astrology’s basic premise is that the sun, moon, planets, and constellations have an effect on humans and earthly events. Further, it uses a set of rules about the relative positions and movements of the stars and planets to predict and explain worldly events and human personality.

However, as Understanding Science explains, “Although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid — and this is a key part of science.”

Plus, astrology doesn’t lead to ongoing research, which is another key part of science.

So, unfortunately for everyone who swears their daily horoscope is always on point or blames their stubbornness on being a Scorpio or a Taurus, it appears that there’s not much scientific evidence to back those claims. Until then, astrology will have to remain in the realm of pseudoscience.

360,Cat litter. ,http://www.iflscience.com/technology/theres-a-rather-unusual-way-to-fix-your-phone-if-youve-dunked-it-in-water/,"Dropping your phone into a fluid-carrying vessel, whether that be a swimming pool, a pond, or a (hopefully otherwise empty) toilet, is a profoundly irritating event, and one that many phones tend not to return intact from. There are normally two options at this point: sticking your phone in some rice, which can suck out the water, or swearing profusely and sulking.

According to phone company Gazelle, there is a third option, so long as you own a cat or kitten. No, despite their smarts, your feline companions themselves won’t be able to help you – in fact, they probably don’t care about your technological predicament. As it turns out, a specific type of cat litter is more effective at saving your phone from a watery death than rice.

In a post entitled “The Truth About Rice, the Galaxy and Everything,” which definitely oversells itself, Gazelle explains how its dedicated team of phone revivers purposefully drowned nine unfortunate smartphones before attempting to resurrect each one via different methods, including rice, instant oatmeal, pearly couscous, regular cat litter, and crystal kitty litter – the last of which is silica gel, the dehydrating agent found in little packets inside many electronics packages.

The company recommends that you shake as much of the water out of your phone first, allowing it to briefly air dry, then place it in a bag of crystal cat litter for as long as possible. They suggest that it takes several days for this to work, so the wait promises to be nail-biting.

If, however, your phone still isn’t operational 48 to 72 hours after the clumsiness occurred, then you may want to buy yourself a new phone.

362,"The sun is in a state of solar minimum where the amount of activity drops dramatically-- can even be devoid of features. On the other hand, when we can see sunspots, it's undergoing a solar maximum. This whole changing from maximum to minimum lasts for 11 years. ",http://www.iflscience.com/space/why-is-the-sun-blank/,"A new image of the Sun shows a rather strange occurrence – there are no visible features on the surface, indicating very little activity. Rather than signaling the end of times, though, this highlights a regular process taking place on our Solar System’s star.

The Sun goes through cycles of activity lasting 11 years, moving from a solar maximum to a solar minimum. During a maximum, the Sun is at its most active, with sunspots – dark areas of magnetic activity – occurring frequently across the surface, several hundred per year. Often, these can be accompanied by bursts of material called coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The exact cause of solar cycles is not fully understood.

During a solar minimum, the amount of activity drops dramatically. And, in some instances, the Sun can be devoid of any noticeable features at all. That’s the case in this latest image, taken on June 4 by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). As highlighted by meteorologist Paul Dorian at Vencore Weather, this was part of a quiet spell that lasted for about four days. This suggests we are heading towards the next solar minimum, predicted to take place around 2020.

“The blank sun is a sign that the next solar minimum is approaching and there will be an increasing number of spotless days over the next few years,” writes Dorian. “At first, the blankness will stretch for just a few days at a time, then it’ll continue for weeks at a time, and finally it should last for months at a time when the sunspot cycle reaches its nadir.”

Here's what the Sun looks like with sunspots on the surface, taken from July 24 to August 1, 2012. NASA/SDO/HMI

This cycle is called Solar Cycle 24, being the 24th observed since sunspot activity was first recorded in 1755. Dorian also said this is the weakest cycle in more than a century, since Solar Cycle 14 in 1906.

In this 24th cycle, solar maximum was reached in April 2014, and the next maximum is not expected until the 2020s. Despite some claims to the contrary, though, this solar minimum is very natural – and it’s not about to cause a “mini ice age”. Perhaps the most noticeable change during a solar minimum is an increase in cosmic rays making their way to Earth.

During high activity, the Sun usually protects Earth from cosmic rays – originating from things like supernovas – thanks to its solar storms. But during lesser activity, cosmic rays can more easily enter the Solar System, and could pose a threat to the health of astronauts.

At any rate, we’ve survived solar cycles before, and this one will be no different. Still, this latest picture is pretty interesting to look at.

363,They're not. It's the unexpectedness of finding an unusual object beside them that they find frightening. ,http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/cats-are-completely-terrified-cucumbers-why/,"Cats are deeply curious creatures. Recent evidence suggests that these tiny lions see us as inessential landlords, or rubbish, fur-lacking kittens. A new internet craze involving our feline companions has unveiled another piece of strange information: For some utterly bizarre reason, they appear to be terrified – utterly terrified – of cucumbers.

In the vast majority of the videos, cat owners are seen sneaking up behind their pets as they’re facing the other way – mostly eating – and placing the green, elongated vegetable behind them. As the cat turns around and spots the unexpected item, it loses its mind, leaps into the air, and gets away from it as fast as it can. In some videos, the cats then engage in a stare down with the cucumber, waiting in vain for it to make its first move.

But the question remains: Why on Earth are cats frightened by these innocuous vegetables?

To be fair, there aren’t any videos of cats seeing a cucumber from a distance and then walking up to interrogate it, so perhaps it’s the unexpected sight of a cucumber behind them that’s frightening, not the cucumber itself: An unexpected pineapple would likely be just as jarring. As it turns out, Dr. Roger Mugford, a specialist in animal behavior, told the Telegraph: “I think that the reaction is due to the novelty and unexpectedness of finding an unusual object secretly placed whilst their heads were down in the food bowl.”

Cats are shown to be suspicious of anything that moves rapidly, makes a lot of noise, or lights up erratically: essentially, anything that they don’t fully understand, which isn’t really that different from most animals, including humans. It’s also worth noting that cats are mostly solitary animals, and humans are as sociable as animals can be – so they’re baffled enough by us as it is. Freaking them out with unexpected cucumbers probably isn’t helping.

“Cats have to be suspicious of the unknown: It could represent the danger of a snake or another predator,” Mugford continued. “I suspect that there would be the same reaction to a model spider, a plastic fish or a human face mask.”

Well, there’s only one way to find out. This is, after all, for science. Get your model spiders at the ready.",2016-07-04 08:46:18

",http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/why-does-eating-pineapple-make-your-mouth-sore/,"Pineapples are thought to have originated in South America and were first discovered by Europeans in 1492 on the island of Guadeloupe. However, pineapples didn't make it to England until the late 1600's, where it quickly became a must-have item for the wealthy. Worth around $8,000 (£5000) each, only the absolute elite could afford this exotic fruit, and according to one source, the fruit wasn't even eaten – just carried around under one's arm at parties and social events as a status symbol.

If you've ever eaten a pineapple, you'll have experienced that weird, scratchy, rough feeling on your tongue after you've munched through a few chunks. So why does that happen?

It turns out that pineapple contains bromelain, a mixture of enzymes that digest proteins. Despite bromelain being an approved anti-inflammatory treatment and having other health benefits, when it comes into contact with the sensitive skin in and around one's mouth, it's actually breaking down proteins, causing the tissue to become sore and inflamed.

365,"Give it some head. A layer of small bubbles insulates the beer from air exposure (which degrades the taste over time) and leads to a ""creamy mouthfeel — like a draft."".",http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/a-cure-for-cheap-beer/62256,"Open the fridge, grab a frosty one, pop off the cap and enjoy. That’s the ritual performed countless times a day by us beer drinkers. And we’re all doing it wrong.

At least, that’s what Philip Petracca, co-founder of New Hampshire-based Fizzics, believes. His company’s mission is to give every one of us the “perfect pour.” How? With a home beer tap machine that uses science to improve the drinking experience, regardless of the brand. The secret to making any beer taste better is in getting a better head, Petracca claims. Beer in cans, bottles or barrels contains a lot of dissolved CO2 under pressure, he says, and when improperly handled it can cause bubbles and foam to overflow or improperly foam.

So, if the bubbles are too big — a common result of a hand-pour — our mouths perceive a “grainy” feel, which can lead many a beer drinker to avoid pouring heads altogether. But that’s a mistake, according to Petracca. Not only does the head insulate the rest of the beer from flavor-robbing oxygen (even a few minutes of air exposure can degrade the taste), but it can also help seal in the gases that give beer its effervescence, something that likewise maximizes flavor.

… produces a head with small, perfectly formed bubbles, which delivers a creamy mouthfeel — like a draft.

The Fizzics machine, which is about the size of a small kitchen appliance, produces a head with small, perfectly formed bubbles, which delivers a creamy mouthfeel — like a draft. Here’s how it works. Place a bottle, can or growler (a reusable container for transporting draft beer) — the Fizzics machine doesn’t care — inside its sealed chamber. Pull forward on the silver tap handle to pressurize the chamber, which forces the beer out of its original container and into your glass via a small plastic tube. The magic happens toward the end of the pour, when you push the tap handle backward. This action kick-starts the patented agitation process, which turns the remaining drops of liquid into an ultra-smooth head, using sound waves. There are no gas cylinders or other consumables needed — just four AA batteries.

Steve Abrams, co-founder of Canada’s Mill Street Brewery, agrees a good beer head improves the taste of a brew considerably, noting that in Europe, bartenders will often take extra time to “layer” your beer as it’s poured. Though he hasn’t tried the Fizzics, Abrams has encountered “lots of beer gadgets,” even one that lets you pour a beer with your mind. He says the Fizzics could indeed improve a beer’s taste, as long as it’s served cold. But some might find the selling price of $150 (they start shipping in October) a bit steep. Petracca defends the cost, pointing out that when compared to a night at a bar, “it’s not expensive at all, if experiences and social connections are important.”

Perhaps it’s a nice idea for a gift, but Abrams points out that “pouring beer into a glass is not rocket science,” and offers up this video for those who need a quick 101 on the technique. Rocket science or not, the Fizzics would certainly make a good conversation piece. To that, we say, “Cheers!”",2016-06-28 16:25:02
366,"They tend to live longer. However, it's not necessarily the act of having a child later in life that causes longevity, but that the bodies of women who can support healthy pregnancies later in life tend to age slower. ",http://www.ozy.com/acumen/late-kids-long-life/32804?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=US,"Because if you are able to have kids later in life, you might be wired to live longer, too.

Attention, 30-something single ladies: If you’re tired of people dropping not-so-subtle hints about having kids while you still have the eggs and energy, you can (probably, politely) tell them to back off.

A Boston University School of Medicine study found that women who can still give birth naturally after age 33 have a higher chance of living to extreme old age than those who had their last child before age 30. But the report, published in the online version of the journal Menopause in April 2014 doesn’t imply that putting off pregnancy will add years to your life. “If you physically delay having children, that’s not going to help with longevity, Paola Sebastiani, a Boston University biostatistics professor and study co-author, told OZY. A woman with a natural ability to have children later in life suggests that her body – including her reproductive system – just happens to age at a slow pace. Some women’s biological clocks simply tick more slowly than most.

Women who had their last child after 33 were twice as likely to live to 95 or older, compared with those who had their last child by 29.

Sebastiani and her colleagues analyzed data from the Long Life Family Study, a survey of 551 families, many of whose members lived to a ripe old age. They determined the ages at which 462 women had their last child and how long they ended up living. Turns out women who gave birth to their last child after 33 were twice as likely to live to 95 years or older, compared with those who had their last child by age 29.

The researchers suspect that the former group’s DNA might harbor genetic variants that slow aging and lower the risk for age-related diseases that can hamper fertility (like ovarian cancer or diabetes). Women with such variants could presumably bear children for a longer period of time, boosting their chances of passing these genes down to future generations — meaning we may have women to thank for the evolution of longevity genes. It could also explain why of the people who live to be 100 or older, 85% are women, compared to only 15% of men.

Earlier studies have unearthed similar insights. Take the ongoing New England Centenarian Study, which found that women who had children after 40 were a whopping four times more likely to live to 100 than women who had their last child at a younger age.

Given the possible link between longevity and a longer fertility window, Sebastiani’s findings also suggest that researchers should further investigate the genetic influences of reproductive fitness, since they might also affect aging rates and vulnerability to age-related diseases. Sebastiani and her team have been working to identify the genetic variants that make some women age slower and plan to publish their results at the end of this year. Understanding the pathways they govern could help scientists develop drugs that produce the same effect.

368,"They were at a motivational seminar led by Tony Robbins (not the first time this has happened at his seminars) yet only 40 of 7000 participants were burned, likely because they were stopping on the coals to take videos and selfies. ",https://gizmodo.com/40-people-got-burned-firewalking-in-texas-for-the-dumbe-1782559421,"Around 40 people attending a seminar with motivational speaker Tony Robbins in downtown Dallas yesterday were injured when a group exercise involving walking across hot coals went wrong. And it’s not the first time this has happened: back in 2012, for instance, 21 people in San Jose were burned after attempting the stunt at another Robbins seminar.

People got burned walking across hot coals, you say? There’s a shocker. But the Dallas seminar had over 7000 participants, most of whom completed the fire walking ceremony without injury. Why did most of those people walk across the coals safely while a (relative) handful got burned?

The Robbins camp might say they just didn’t believe in themselves enough to fully unleash the power within, but it actually has everything to do with physics. As I wrote back in 2012, it is quite possible to firewalk safely. A physics professor at the University of Pittsburgh named David Willey does it all the time, thanks to his grasp of the underlying physics.

This is well-established science. The key factors at play are the low thermal conductivity of the burning wood-turned-to-coal, an insulating layer of ash, and the short time of contact between the hot coals and the soles of the feet.

In particular, the coals must burn down to around 1000 degrees Fahrenheit, preferably with a thin layer of ash providing extra insulation. This also burns off excess water, which increases the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the coals.

And while it’s tempting to want to run across hot coals, this actually pushes your feet deeper into the embers, increasing the burn risk. A nice steady walking pace is best. (Some say wetting your feet beforehand can add protection via the Leidenfrost effect, but Willey has found the effects of this to be negligible and prefers to firewalk dry-footed.)

Back in 1998, Willey and Kjetil Kjernsmo of University of Oslo developed a computer model of a fire walker’s foot, and then compared it to infrared imagery of people fire walking in Seattle. Those images showed that the foot really does remain cool when the stunt is done correctly.

“[T]here was someone in front of us and someone behind us on their cell phone, taking selfies and taking pictures.”

So what went wrong in Dallas? Probably the same thing that happened at the 2012 San Jose seminar. You have to set up a scientific experiment correctly to get the best results, and for something like fire walking there’s not much margin for error. Those who got burned probably lingered just a bit too long on the hot coals, the better to, say, snap a selfie of their moment of enlightenment.

That seems to be borne out by witness statements. “From my observation, there was someone in front of us and someone behind us on their cell phone, taking selfies and taking pictures,” Jacqueline Luxemberg, a participant who did the firewalk and emerged unscathed, told WFAA. “[She asked others] to video record for her, so I think that that has a lot to do with it.”

So should you ever decide to attempt a fire walking stunt yourself, remember: walk (don’t run), make sure the coals have burned down sufficiently, don’t wet your feet beforehand, and try not to strike too long a pose for that selfie. Oh, and have some ice and Vicodin handy, just in case.

369,"It's a red, snow-dwelling algae that causes glaciers to melt more quickly. ",https://gizmodo.com/this-pink-snow-does-not-bode-well-for-our-future-1782421694?utm_campaign=socialflow_io9_facebook&utm_source=io9_facebook&utm_medium=socialflow,"Your first thought on seeing this weird pink snow might be an industrial accident or a nearby Big Foot massacre. Rest assured, it’s neither—just a perfectly natural, snow-dwelling algae. So, why are scientists all in a tizzy about it? Because it’s causing glaciers to melt faster.

Advertisement

That’s the startling conclusion of a study just published in Nature Communications that which suggests we may have seriously underestimated the ability of tiny red algae to screw with Earth’s ice caps. And their so-called “bio-albedo” feedback is only expected to grow as the planet warms up.

Red snow algae have been described all over the world in polar and alpine settings from Greenland and Antarctica to Iceland and the European Alps. In the winter, they lie dormant in the snow as spores. But in the late spring and summer, when their icy habitat begins to melt, they blossom to produce striking pink landscapes.

Now, a sweeping analysis of red snow algae across 21 glaciers in the pan-European Arctic shows that these tiny critters are actually helping the snow melt faster.

The reason has to do with a simple climate-altering process known as the albedo effect. You’ve probably heard about how glaciers keep our planet cool by reflecting sunlight. As glaciers melt, they give way to darker land or ocean surfaces—surfaces with a lower albedo. This causes the Earth to absorb more sunlight and heat up even more.

Turns out, red snow algae have a non-trivial effect on the albedo of the snowy surfaces they colonize, reducing it by as much as 13 percent, according to the new study. And while it’s still unclear just how large these blooms can get, lead study author Steffi Lutz of the University of Leeds says they can be quite widespread in the Arctic by summertime.

Advertisement

“Based on personal observations, a conservative estimate would be 50 percent of the snow surface on a glacier at the end of a melt season,” she told Gizmodo in an email. “But this can potentially be even higher.”



This makes red snow algae an unaccounted mechanism in the long list of reasons the Arctic is melting like a popsicle in a microwave. Lutz and her colleagues are now working to estimate how much glacial melt red snow algae are actually responsible for. They’re also hoping to incorporate the colorful critters into future global climate models.

Advertisement

What’s worrisome is that even if red snow algae have a small influence on Arctic ice cover today, their role is likely to grow as human carbon emissions warm the planet.

Advertisement

“The algae need liquid water in order to bloom,” Lutz said. “Therefore the melting of snow and ice surfaces controls the abundance of the algae. The more melting, the more algae. With temperatures rising globally, the snow algae phenomenon will likely also increase leading to an even higher bio-albedo effect.”

It’s yet another reminder that microbes are pulling the strings around here much more than we humans tend to appreciate. And that even as Miami drowns, some creatures will thrive in the hotter future.

370,Working over 60 hours per week plus doing chores at home may lead to eventual health issues like heart disease. ,http://hellogiggles.com/we-finally-have-a-scientifically-backed-reason-to-not-clean-our-homes/,"Having a clean home is one of life’s little joys, right? But by the time Sunday rolls around you’re probably like us and think, “I HATE CLEANING!”

While there are plenty of excuses you can come up with to NOT clean your home, deep-down you probably know most of those are not very good reasons.

Here’s where science can help!

Allard Dembe, professor of health services mangement and policy at Ohio State University’s College of Public Health, looked at women from the working generation of the ’70s to ’80s. This was a time when more and more women were having careers, but also still dealing with daily chores back home.

Dembe told The Huffington Post, “My speculation is that women have to play a lot of multiple roles.” He continued, “It’s less surprising that women who are then into their 50s and 60s are really bearing the disease repercussions of what’s happened during those early years of really working their butts off.”

Well, you may be right, according to a new study.

Cats, dogs, and other mammals are thought to see in ultraviolet light, which opens up a whole different world than the one we see, the study explains.

Seeing the World in Ultraviolet (UV) Light

UV light is the wave length beyond the visible light from red to violet that humans can see. Humans have a lens that blocks UV from reaching the retina. It was previously thought that most mammals have lenses similar to humans.

Scientists studied the lenses of dead mammals, including cats, dogs, monkeys, pandas, hedgehogs, and ferrets. By researching how much light passes through the lens to reach the retina, they concluded that some mammals previously thought not to be able to see UV actually can.

""Nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet, but in fact, they do,"" Ron Douglas, the study leader and a biologist at City University London, England, told LiveScience.

What purpose does being able to see UV light serve for animals such as reindeer, rodents, and other mammals? It allows reindeer to see polar bears, for example, which are nearly invisible in regular light because they blend in with the snow.

UV light also allows mammals to see urine trails. This would be helpful for predator animals, such as cats and dogs, to find food in the wild.

373,"Fungicides, disinfectants, plant-growth regulators, and fluoride. ",http://ethicalfoods.com/sprayed-produce-harvest/,"Are chemicals added to fresh fruits and vegetables after harvest?

We know that processed foods often contain a host of unhealthy additives, from fake flavors and colors to chemical preservatives. What you don’t know is that sometimes chemicals are added to fresh produce after it’s picked and before it gets to the grocery store.

When you buy an apple, a bag of potatoes or an orange, you’re probably under the impression that these fresh fruits and vegetables have only been washed clean before being stacked neatly in the produce section.

In addition to the chemicals used to grow produce, there are a host of post harvest chemicals and colorants applied: in the field, in washing water, in transport, in storage and in packaging. Unlike processed foods, there is no label on fresh food that tells us what they are.

Commonly used chemicals

Sodium orthophenylphenate (SOPP)

How it’s used: Fungicide which prevents or delays the appearance of rota and molds on produce.

Thiabendazole (TBZ)

How it’s used: Thiabendazole is used as a fungicide to control green mold, blue mold, and stem end rot on citrus fruits. It controls Cercospora leaf spot on sugar beets; crown rot on bananas; bluemold rot, bully eye rot, and gray mold on apples and pears; black rot, scurf and foot rot on sweet potatoes; and to control Fusarium (dry rot) in potato storage. It can be used on soybeans to reduce the severity of pod and stem blight such as anthracnose, brown spot, frogeye leaf spot and purple stain.

Sodium hypochlorite

How it’s used: The active ingredient of most liquid household bleaches, sodium hypochlorite is commonly used when the scale of postharvest chlorination is limited. It is used in postharvest management as an algicide, disinfectant, and sanitizer.

Sodium hypochlorite is an approved chemical for use in organic postharvest systems by under the USDA National Organic Program (NOP) Rule.

Maleic hydrazide

How it’s used: The compound is used to inhibit sprouting in potatoes, onions and carrots in storage, to induce dormancy in citrus fruits and as a plant-growth regulator to control growth of tobacco, potatoes, onions, non-bearing citrus, beans, beets, corn, lima beans, peas, strawberries, sugar beets, garlic and tomatoes.

In Austria and Denmark, use of maleic hydrazide is banned.

Sulfuryl fluoride

In January 2011, the EPA—prompted by a joint petition from the Fluoride Action Network (FAN), Environmental Working Group (EWG) and Beyond Pesticides—proposed the phase out of sulfuryl fluoride. The Pest Free Food Supply Act seeks to prevent the proposed phaseout of sulfuryl fluoride from taking effect. In 2014, the use of sulfuryl fluoride’s use in food production was protected, and it is still being applied on harvests.

How it’s used: fumigant applied to stored crops after harvest, leaving significant amounts of fluoride on treated foods. It is a substitute for the post-harvest crop storage uses of the pesticide methyl bromide.

Fluoride is neurotoxic. Over 30 published studies have reported an association between fluoride and reduced IQ in children, animal studies show that the brain is the main target for sulfuryl fluoride’s effects, and fumigation workers who use sulfuryl fluoride have been found to suffer impaired cognitive function. There is a growing consensus that American children are exposed to too much fluoride, in part because of the use of sulfuryl fluoride.

Sulfuryl fluoride is a potent greenhouse gas. Because of this, the Sierra Club, Center for Environmental Health, Defenders of Wildlife, and Center for Biological Diversity oppose efforts to expand sulfuryl fluoride production.

How are chemicals used post harvest?



Fungicides which prevent or delay the appearance of rota and molds in the product.

Examples are, sodium orthophenylphenate (SOPP), thiabendazole (TBZ), sodium hypochlorite, and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Methyl formate (Erinol), ethyl formate and (in some countries) ethylene oxide are frequently applied to dried fruits to kill infestations of insects and molds.

Sulphur dioxide, benzoic acid, propionic acid, ascorbic acid and sorbic acid are added to processed fruit products, especially juices, to inhibit the growth of yeasts and molds.

Chemicals that delay ripening or senescence.

Examples are: the kinins and kinetins that delay chlorophyll degradation and senescence in leafy vegetables; gibberellins that retard the ripening of tomatoes and hold citrus fruits on the tree beyond normal maturity; and auxins that delay deterioration of oranges and green beans.

Growth retardants that inhibit sprouting and growth.

Examples are maleic hydrazide which is applied pre-harvest and inhibits sprouting in a number of stored commodities, e.g., onions and potatoes. A number of chemicals are applied post-harvest to potatoes to control sprouting, for example, CIPC, TCNB and MENA.

Daminozide (Alar) increases fruit firmness, color and encourages early maturation in apples.

Chemicals that hasten ripening and senescence.

Examples are ethylene and compounds such as Ephephon that release ethylene, abscisin, ascorbic acid, ß hydroxyethyl hydrazine (BOH), acetylene and substances that release acetylene such as calcium carbide, and certain alcohols and fatty acids.

Chemicals that may hasten or delay ripening and senescence depending on the dose and the commodity on which they are used.

Examples are 2, 4-D; 2,4, 5-T; indoleacetic acid (IAA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA).

Metabolic inhibitors that block certain biochemical reactions that normally occur.

Examples are cycloheximide, actinomycin D, vitamin K, maleic acid, ethylene oxide, and carbon monoxide.

Fumigants to control insects or sometimes molds. Ethylene dibromide and methyl bromide are the most commonly used fumigants.

Coloring. The use of artificial colors is sometimes permitted in order to improve the appearance of a fruit.

For example, an orange may have artificial color added to the skin for cosmetic purposes.

Food additives. A number of compounds are permitted to be added to processed produce as preservatives, to alter texture or for cosmetic purposes.

The major preservatives are sulphur dioxide, benzoic acid or benzoates, and sorbic acid or sorbates.

Functional additives include antioxidants, coloring, flavoring, thickeners, emulsifiers, etc.

In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has the responsibility for registering agricultural chemicals and pesticides, and setting tolerances. The situation may be quite different in developing countries where governments usually do not have the expertise or analytical laboratories to monitor adequately the use of post-harvest chemicals on perishable crops.

374,"Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-just-discovered-where-hiv-began,"Diseases, while disastrous, often come and go in the public eye. We hear about ebola, but then another one quickly grabs national monitors and TV screens for its fifteen minutes.

However, one condition that seems to not fit into his norm is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

The spread of HIV is a story that would have most television dramas pale in comparison - combining elements of intrigue, suspense, and mystery into one cohesive nightmare that has blanketed the globe since the 1920s.

It all began in Kinshasha, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, in the 1920s, it was better known as the Belgian colony of Leopoldville.

A high profile location for young men to sojourn to in hopes of making a fortune, as it was the capital of Belgian Congo. Therefore, with them came railroads and sex workers.

Two forms of transportation that respectively spread people and infection. With a flourishing location, HIV found many opportunities to grow into the pandemic it is today.

The irony of it all is that HIV-1 group M, the type of HIV that originated in the colony, is responsible for about 90 percent of all infections, while HIV-1 group O, another type of HIV originating nearby is still quietly confined to West Africa.

Thereby suggesting it may have been the opportunities, and not the function, of that disease that enabled it to roar globally.

""Ecological rather than evolutionary factors drove its rapid spread,"" says Nuno Faria at the University of Oxford in the UK, in an interview with the BBC.

Faria and his colleagues were able to make this determination after they built a family tree of HIV by looking at a host of HIV genomes collected from about 800 infected people from central Africa.

Notably, by comparing two genome sequences and counting the differences in them, the team was able to figure out when the two last shared a common ancestor.

Ultimately, Faria determined that the HIV genomes all shared a common ancestor... one that existed no more than 100 years ago. To that end, they assert that it all likely began around 1920.

And with this information, they were able to place the virus to a specific city of origin - Kinshasa, which is now the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

All in all, the genetic assays that helped us localise the origin of the disease are still underway to help us identify points of public health intervention that may help us reduce the spread of the infection. Because, although we may know where it came from, we have yet to figure out where it will end.

",http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-great-pyramid-of-giza-is-slightly-wonky/,"The Great Pyramid of Giza is so seemingly well-built that explanations of how the ancient Egyptians constructed it over 4,500 years ago have been filled with controversy, confusion, and mysticism. And sometimes even aliens. However, according to a new study, the engineering behind it might not be as bang-on as we once thought.

The study by the Glen Dash Research Foundation and the Ancient Egypt Research Associates has discovered that the Great Pyramid doesn’t have a perfectly square base, with one particularly lopsided west-facing edge.

Engineer Glen Dash and Egyptologist Mark Lehner looked for the original edges to the 138-meter (455 feet) tall Great Pyramid of Giza, the largest of the three pyramids found in Giza, just across the River Nile from Egypt's capital, Cairo.

When it was first constructed, under the rule of Pharaoh Khufu, the pyramid was lined with a white limestone casing. Over the centuries, this outer casing was stripped for use in other building projects and left the pyramid how we see it now. Much of this outer edge is too damaged to be of any use, however, the researchers managed to pinpoint 84 points of the original boundary around the pyramid’s 920-meter (3,020 feet) periphery.

Using this data they plotted out the lengths of the pyramid's four sides. The east side measured between 230.295 to 230.373 meters (755.561 to 755.817 feet) in length. However, the west side was around 230.378 to 230.436 meters (755.833 and 756.024 feet). That means the west side could be more than 14 centimeters (5.5 inches) longer than the east.

So, not too bad considering it was built 4,500 years ago. As the researchers say in the study “The data show that the Egyptians possessed quite remarkable skills for their time… We can only speculate as to how the Egyptians could have laid out these lines with such precision using only the tools they had.”

Scientists love a good mystery, and the oceans of the world – being massive, deep, dark, and inherently enigmatic places – are literally full of them. The latest conundrum comes courtesy of the Caribbean Sea, wherein a very low-pitch sound, one well beyond the hearing range of humans, can be heard. In fact, something down there is so huge and mobile that it's generating waves in Earth’s gravitational field.

A team of researchers, led by the University of Liverpool (UL), were in the middle of conducting an expedition to the Atlantic Ocean-based Caribbean Sea, which covers an area of roughly 2,754,000 square kilometers (1,063,000 square miles). Their original objective was to study the dynamic sea currents within the basin, which links up to the Gulf Stream, critical for delivering heat to, among other places, Western Europe.

Writing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the authors describe how their instrumentation picked up something they describe as a “whistle”. The note itself is an A-flat.

But even though Dory was able to work through her worry (thanks to her “just keep swimming” mantra), Finding Nemo and its upcoming sequel, Finding Dory, has some marine biologists pretty worried, according to an article in The Wrap. After Finding Nemo, people everywhere wanted to have a little Nemo for themselves. The original movie’s popularity led to a 40% rise in the sale of clownfish everywhere.

But Dory is no clownfish. She’s a blue tang fish, which are much rarer than clownfish and don’t do nearly as well in tanks. If Finding Dory leads to the same demand for blue tang fish that Finding Nemo did for clown fish, there could be some problems.

380,"Over 80 studies of vitamin D were re-evaluated and found to provide insufficient evidence, therefore the claims remain mere hypothesis (not ""debunked""). 
Thank you Francois!",http://www.mentalfloss.com/article/81861/researchers-debunk-medical-myths-about-vitamin-d,"We are constantly bombarded with conflicting headlines about nutrition and ads for products that promise to make or keep us healthy. Sorting out the truth from the hooey is an uphill battle, but science can help. A team of researchers have examined 10 common claims about vitamin D, and found that most of them lack evidence. They published their findings in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

Lead researcher Michael Allan is the director of Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Alberta. He and his colleagues reviewed more than 80 studies on vitamin D, looking for support for claims that the vitamin can reduce cancer risk, treat arthritis, and more. The team was somewhat surprised by their results; ""Even areas that we really thought there was good evidence for benefit early on, don't seem to be bearing out,"" Allan said in a press statement. In other words, we should rein in our enthusiasm for a ""vitamin D panacea,"" as the authors call it.

The results showed insufficient evidence for eight popular beliefs about vitamin D supplementation:

That it can treat depression;

That it can treat rheumatoid arthritis;

That it can treat multiple sclerosis;

That it can prevent respiratory tract infections;

That it lowers cancer risk and mortality;

That it reduces overall mortality;

That taking a higher dose is better; and

That healthy adults should get their vitamin D levels checked regularly.

The remaining two out of the ten beliefs tested were backed by some evidence. The researchers found that vitamin D supplementation can help reduce the risk of falls and the risk of fracture from falls in older people. But even those benefits are minimal, Allan says.

“If you were to take a group of people who were at higher risk of breaking a bone—so had about a 15 per cent chance of breaking a bone over the next 10 years—and treated all of them with a reasonable dose of vitamin D for a decade, you'd prevent a fracture in around one in 50 of them over that time. Many people would say taking a drug for 10 years to stop one in every 50 fractures is probably not enough to be meaningful.”

Now, just because something hasn’t been proved doesn’t mean it’s wrong. Allan says a lot of the existing vitamin D research was poorly done, and there hasn’t been much of it. It’s possible that, in the future, research will find enough evidence to support some of these claims. But right now, it just isn't there.

384,"70% of people tested had no negative effects to their cholesterol, for the other 30% the ""issue was fairly benign"". The rest of the article talks about nutritional benefits of eggs from eyesight to weight control. ",http://remedydaily.com/2016/02/26/the-health-benefits-of-eating-eggs/?src=bottomxpromo&ro=1&xs=48835_49767_0_4578bc8f758114170b613181e7eaf534&eid=48835&pid=48835,"Eggs, like some other foods, have gotten a bit of a bad rap over the years, with numerous findings reporting that eggs can be chiefly responsible for high levels of cholesterol. However, the truth of the matter is altogether different. In fact, not only is the cholesterol statement erroneous, eggs actually have many varied — and essential — benefits for your body.

Because the average large egg contains between 180 and 186 milligrams of cholesterol, just one immediately counts for over half of your recommended daily intake, the Huffington Post reports. However, it's a little more complicated than that: It turns out cholesterol is actually already being produced, in rather significant amounts, by your body – 1 to 2 grams each day on average. But when you consume foods that contain cholesterol, your body's production of the substance decreases to make up for it. You don't really add cholesterol to existing amounts, you're replacing one kind with another.

Authority Nutrition makes another excellent point: While cholesterol has negative connotations for obvious reasons, it is not a purely harmful molecule. Cholesterol is a vital part of the body, and is essential in creating testosterone, estrogen and cortisol. The website also reports a study where a group of individuals took to eating one to three whole eggs a day. For 70 percent of those people, eggs did not negatively affect cholesterol levels. For the remaining 30 percent, the issue was fairly benign as well: Eggs were found to change LDL cholesterol (the harmful variety) from small, dense molecules to larger ones, which made them a lot less of a threat. One damper on the good news, however: Eggs are found to cause an increased risk of heart disease in diabetics, Authority Nutrition says.

Now that we've dispelled most of the negative preconceptions about eggs, let's explore the advantages to their regular consumption:

1. Nutrients

Shutterstock

Eggs are rich in several different types of nutrients, according to the Huffington Post: They're rich in vitamins A, D, E and B-12, as well as iron, folate, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, among others, all of which are extremely important.

2. Protein

Shutterstock

Eggs provide the highest-quality protein, with a much higher rating than milk or beef. You'd need about 30 grams of meat to equate to a single egg, which is much less expensive.

3. Choline

Shutterstock

Choline, a nutrient you don't frequently hear about, is nonetheless very important for the brain. It helps promote growth and memory function. Choline supplements are especially crucial for pregnant mothers, where most of the woman's choline supplies will be sent to her child and she will be left with a critically low amount. 90 percent of people are lacking in choline. Eggs contain plenty of this nutrient.

4. Eyesight

Shutterstock

Eggs are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that gather in the eye region and protect your eyes from dangerous light wavelengths, as well as lower the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.

5. Weight control

Shutterstock

Eggs help with satiety, meaning they make you feel fuller than many other foods. People who start the day with some eggs in their breakfast feel much less hungry throughout the day, which allows them to take smaller meals.

6. Bones, hair and nails

Shutterstock

The vitamin D and calcium mentioned previously are of great importance for the bones, helping them grow stronger. Eggs help prevent osteoporosis this way. In addition, the amino acids and minerals in eggs promote healthier hair and nails, the website says.

So should you eat three eggs a day? Authority Nutrition recommends it, saying the benefits are much stronger than the downsides. But ""Today"" reports such an intake in eggs can lead to carotid plaque buildup in the arteries, as well as an increased risk in heart attack and stroke due to the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide, a somewhat harmful chemical.

The Huffington Post suggests varying up your diet a bit, stating three eggs a day can be a bit much. However, there's clearly no reason not to enjoy more than one of these a day – especially if you prefer free-range eggs to the supermarket variety, which has been found to provide a lot less nutrients.

387,Yes. It's a natural uranium ore deposit that was discovered in 1972. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/there-really-ancient-nuclear-reactor-africa/,"An ancient nuclear reactor that was churning away 2 billion years ago sounds like a myth. Maybe it's because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure. But in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the Earth's crust, found in Okla, Gabon. Uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions.

The natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. The pile of rock in the ground in Okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago!

It was discovered in 1972, when some French scientists took uranium ore from the mine in Gabon to test its uranium content. Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions.

One would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium.",2016-06-18 10:01:12
388,"An inconclusive study shows that heavy, daily marijuana use may affect the reward centers of the brain in a manner similar to addiction. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-something-strange-when-they-looked-at-the-brains-of-pot-smokers,"Marijuana's official designation as a Schedule 1 drug – something with ""no accepted medical use"" – means it is pretty tough to study. Yet numerous anecdotal reports, as well as some studies, have linked marijuana with several purported health benefits, from pain relief to helping with certain forms of epilepsy.

Still, experts say more rigorous scientific analyses are needed. Use of marijuana, a psychoactive drug, can come with risks, especially in people who may be prone to addiction or mental illness. And now, for the first time, researchers have found a link between daily decade-long weed use and a difference in how the brain processes reward.

For years, researchers have suggested that such a link exists – and if it does, that it could play a powerful role in addiction. An important part of this line of thought is that addicts, far from amoral individuals incapable of making intelligent decisions, simply respond differently to drugs – neurologically, psychologically, physiologically – than people who are not addicted.

And this response is probably the result of many factors outside the person's control, including genetics, behaviour, and environment.

So for their study, published on Wednesday in the journal Human Brain Mapping, researchers at the Centre for BrainHealth at the University of Texas, Dallas, took a look at the brains of 53 daily long-term pot users (14 of whom met the American Psychiatric Association's criteria for addiction) and 68 people who'd never used the drug daily.

Then the researchers showed them a series of objects meant to test their reward response. The objects included one type of fruit (the ""natural cue""), a pencil (the ""neutral cue""), and either a bong, a pipe, or a joint (the ""cannabis cue""), depending on which one the participant said they preferred.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP/File

Importantly, this study did not look at so-called recreational users – those who use the drug every few weeks or months. Instead, it focused on people who used the drug every day for an average of 12 years, several of whom met the criteria for being addicted to the drug, and many of whom displayed some signs of past or present problems with weed.

Why? Because the researchers wanted to tease out how changes to the brain's reward pathway might affect those who used the drug every day for years – and, more importantly, why.

Not surprisingly, when the chronic users were presented with either the bong, pipe, or joint, they displayed a stronger response in several parts of their brain linked with reward than they did when they were shown the fruit cues.

In contrast, the non-users did not show a significantly greater response to either the weed or fruit cues, and some parts of their brains showed a greater response to the fruit than to the bong, pipe, or joint.

""We found that marijuana disrupts the brain's natural reward circuitry, making marijuana highly salient to heavy users,"" Francesca Filbey, the director of cognitive neuroscience research of addictive disorders at the Centre for BrainHealth and an associate professor in the School of Behavioural and Brain Sciences, told Business Insider.

""In essence, these brain alterations could be a marker of transition from recreational marijuana use to problematic use,"" she said.

The orbitofrontal cortex, highlighted in green.

Marijuana and the brain

In another 2014 study also by Filbey, she and her team found that, compared with people who didn't use pot, long-term, heavy users tended to have a smaller orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region critical for processing emotions and making decisions.

And, interestingly enough, the heavy users also appeared to have more cross-brain connections. Scientists think regular users may develop these links as a means of compensating for the difference in size. The regular pot users also had lower IQ scores overall when compared with the people who didn't use the drug.

To arrive at their results – one of the first comprehensive, 3D pictures of the brains of adults who'd smoked weed at least four times a week, often multiple times a day, for years – the researchers used a combination of MRI-based brain scans.

Still, that study did not show that chronic weed use caused certain regions of the brain to shrink, or that pot use caused lower IQ scores – it simply showed a relationship among those factors.

""We cannot honestly say that that is what's happening here,"" Filbey told Business Insider in 2014.

Similarly, the latest study does not show that chronic pot use causes a change in the brain's reward response; the reverse could also be true, that the changed reward response influenced the chronic pot use.

390,"No. It's a panorama camera glitch paired with ""psychological priming"" since the hotel advertises itself as being haunted and is the location of the filming of ""The Shining"". ",http://www.livescience.com/54462-mysterious-figure-stanley-hotel-is-ghost-glitch.html,"A visitor to a famous—and famously haunted—hotel in Colorado claims to have captured a ghostly image.

According to a CNN story, ""Tourist Henry Yau recently took a picture at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which appears to show two ghostly apparitions standing on a staircase.

In the photo, a woman can be seen at the top of the stairs in a period outfit with a child beside her."" The photo has gone viral, leaving many scratching their heads and others heading to the Stanley to see for themselves.

American Horror Stories: Ghosts and Hauntings

Many commenters on social media think it's a ghost (or two), and several amateur ghost hunters have weighed in suggesting it's unexplainable. Others, however, have a pretty good idea of what it is. Researcher Kenny Biddle of the Geeks & Ghosts podcast and the ""I am Kenny Biddle"" blog, examined the photo and noted that Yau used the panoramic feature on his iPhone to capture a full view of the grand stairwell.

This offers a clue because the in panorama mode the camera doesn't just take one photo but instead scans across the scene rapidly. Biddle notes that ""Panoramic images are not taken in the same fraction of a second as a normal images are. They take several seconds … which would allow Yau to start taking his panoramic image at one end of the room, and another guest or two to hit the halfway point down the stairs, turn the corner, and begin the second set of stairs to the floor as Yau ends his panoramic image on the other side of the room.""

Odd glitches using the panorama function on cameras are common, and many websites display hundreds of bizarre and double images. A Tumblr account titled ""Panorama Fail"" offers dozens of accidental digital grotesqueries. The ""ghost"" is ""most likely just a guest that was captured coming down the stairs while a panoramic image was taken over the course of several seconds,"" Biddle concludes.

British Viral 'Ghost Photo' Explained

Though some have dismissed the image as an artifact of the panorama feature, Biddle notes that ""when looking at a close up of the alleged ghost and second ghost (to the left of the more solid looking figure), we see that the features of both figures match up: the hair, the spaghetti-strap top, the height of the head, shoulders, and the top of the dress. This is a double image of the same person, not someone else. This effect was caused by the low light environment, slower scanning speed due to the camera trying to take in more light, and the movement of this person as they rounded the corner.""

Yau claims that he doesn't remember seeing anyone at the top of the staircase when he took the photo, but it's quite possible that he simply didn't notice the woman as she appeared and turned at the top of the stairs, as he was trying to hold the camera steady and take the photo. (Yau also claimed that he waited until there was no one in the area when taking the photo, though two people can be clearly seen on the left side of the photo.)

How the unexpected hotel guest was dressed likely also played a role in how her image was interpreted; she seems to be wearing a classic black or dark dress (as befits a fancy, well-known hotel); had she been wearing a yellow blazer and carrying a large Target shopping bag speculations about her spectral origins would likely have been scuttled.

Video: Do Ghosts Exist?

Creepy Context

Upon closer inspection there is nothing remarkable in the image; it's a perfectly ordinary blurry, double image common in long exposure and panoramic iPhone photographs. Had it been taken in any number of other locations, it would not likely have attracted such attention. So why is image played up as a mystery? The answer lies in its context.

Context plays two roles in the creation of ""spooky"" photos. Most people (that is, non-professional photographers) routinely take photos that are flawed in some way, or that have odd or unusual images in them, including flash reflected ""orbs,"" odd shadows, blurry body parts, double exposures, objects behind a person seemingly coming out of their heads, and so on. Usually they are ignored or deleted, unless the photographer (or someone else) decides that there's some reason why the photo might be of something supernatural.

The photo was taken at a doubly famous hotel—not only is it where the Stephen King-scripted, Stanley Kubrick-directed horror classic ""The Shining"" was filmed, but it's also claimed to be one of the most haunted hotels in the country. In fact the hotel specifically advertises itself as a paranormal destination and caters to ghost hunting tourists. Because of this, guests there are more likely to see ghosts (in person and in photos) than in comparable non-haunted lodgings—and this is true whether ghosts exist or not.

Ghost Stories: The Science Behind Sightings

This is because of a psychological process called priming, in which our expectations can influence our interpretations. To some degree we see what we want or expect to see—and that can include ghosts. People who are aware of a building's haunted reputation are more likely to take many photos, and anything odd or even potentially mysterious in those photos is likely to be considered evidence of ghosts.

A person could take an equal number of similar odd photos at a location not assumed to be haunted—a local supermarket or lake shore, for example—and the odd photographic artifact would not be as closely examined nor interpreted as anything mysterious, just a flawed photo.

The second contextual factor is of course that the Stanley hotel and others like it have a vested economic interest in promoting such photos as ghostly—or at the very least maintaining an agnostic stance about them. This isn't necessarily cynicism but pragmatism: There is no publicity to be gained by casting any doubt a claimed ghost photo taken in their hotel that's making news.

Biddle told Discovery News, ""This is a classic example of inexperienced investigators and fluff piece media jumping the gun and promoting an easily explainable anomaly as something supernatural rather than doing legitimate investigative/detective work to figure out the mystery. It's the reason paranormal investigation remains in the land of pseudoscience."" Whether ghosts haunt the Stanley remains to be seen, but it's unlikely that Yau's staircase double exposure is one of them.

391,"Scientist's aren't sure yet, but they do display REM-like patterns with high and low brain frequency during sleep. ",http://www.livescience.com/54593-do-australian-dragons-dream.html,"Australian dragons cycle through more than 350 episodes of rapid eye movement and slow-wave sleep each night, spending about half their sleeping hours in each phase.

Do dragons dream? Maybe, according to new research that finds rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep in a lizard, the Australian dragon, for the first time.

The discovery suggests that these phases of sleep may be more than 100 million years older than previously realized.

REM sleep is characterized by brain waves that look similar to waking brain activity. In mammals, the large muscles of the body are immobile, but the eyes twitch randomly during REM sleep. People do most of their dreaming in this phase of sleep. Slow-wave sleep is a non-REM sleep phase that is marked by slow brain waves called delta waves. [Top 10 Spooky Sleep Disorders]

Sleep's missing link?

Quiet, sleep-like periods are known in many animals, even invertebrates like fruit flies. However, researchers had only found REM and slow-wave sleep brain activity in mammals and birds. Both of those kinds of animals diverged from a common group, the amniotes — mammals, reptiles and birds that lay eggs on land or hold them in their bodies — more than 300 million years ago. The amniotes gave rise to the synapsids and the sauropsids. Mammals are the only group of synapsids left (the earliest arose about 195 million years ago). The sauropsids encompassed the dinosaurs as well as modern birds and reptiles.

The fact that sleep appeared only in these two disparate branches of the evolutionary tree was puzzling, said lead study researcher Gilles Laurent, a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Germany. It seemed that mammals and birds had independently evolved the brain patterns for REM and slow-wave sleep — a case of convergent evolution — or, more confusingly, that these sleep patterns were an ancestral trait that was lost multiple times among reptile lineages but somehow not in birds.

The new research, which will be published Friday (April 29) in the journal Science, suggests a much simpler explanation: REM and slow-wave sleep were present in a common amniote ancestor, and the fingerprints of these brain patterns had been missed until now.

""It poses many questions: How did sleep start? What did it start for? Is sleep the way that we understand it today in mammals, including humans, the same thing as what it started as?"" Laurent told Live Science. ""These questions are ones we'd like to find answers to.""

REM sleep in reptiles

Laurent and his colleagues didn't intend to study sleep, at first. His lab is interested in how the cortex works, and he uses lizards as model organisms to study this brain region. The researchers were using electrodes implanted in the brains of Australian dragons (Pogona vitticeps) to record brain activity.

An Australian dragon (Pogona vitticeps), the first lizard ever discovered to have mammalian-like brain patterns during sleep. The discovery, reported April 29 in the journal Science, suggests that the evolution of this brain activity may date back at least 320 million years. (Image credit: Dr. Stephan Junek, Max Planck Institute for Brain Research)

""In the middle of some experiments we were doing, we decided to let the recordings go overnight after a day's work, just to see what would happen during the night,"" Laurent said. ""And upon analyzing the results, there were interesting oscillations of activity that were very regular, that suggested the potential existence of sleep-related patterns of activity in the brain.""

Further recordings of the brains of five different lizards of the same species revealed two distinct sleep patterns. One showed high-frequency wave forms of about 20 cycles per second. The other showed low-frequency wave forms of less than 4 cycles per second. Video recordings of the sleeping lizards showed that during the high-frequency brain activity, the dragons' eyes twitched periodically.

""We had a characterization that was starting to become more and more like what we observe in mammalian sleep,"" Laurent said. ""A REM phase with broadband activity and high-frequency activity, and slow-wave sleep where there is no eye movement."" [What Do Dogs Dream About?]

The slow waves also showed negative spikes of electrical potential 200 to 400 milliseconds long, interrupted with an oscillation of the brain's electrical activity, Laurent said. These ""sharp waves"" and ""ripples"" are seen in the slow brain waves of mammalian sleep, he said.

Modern equipment and analysis techniques likely allowed Laurent and his team to find these brain patterns where others had failed, Laurent said.

There are differences between the sleep of lizards and mammals, however. In humans, for example, the REM phase of the sleep cycle is relatively short. A person might experience just 5 minutes per hour of slow-wave sleep at the beginning of the night, and then, as this phase gradually lengthens, 15 or 20 minutes per 90 minutes of slow-wave sleep later on. In the Australian dragon, the ratio of REM to slow-wave sleep is about 50-50. And the dragon cycles between the two every minute or minute and a half. They experience up to 350 sleep cycles per night, compared to four or five in humans.

These patterns arose in a brain region called the dorsal ventricular ridge, which doesn't exist in mammals, Laurent said. The sleep patterns seen in the study were similar to the ones seen in the mouse hippocampus during sleep, but strangely, the dorsal ventricular ridge is not analogous in its connections or neural cell makeup to the mammal hippocampus at all, Laurent said.

Do Australian dragons dream?

The research suggests that REM and slow-wave sleep may have evolved in the amniotes, but the patterns found in the lizards studied may be even older, Laurent said. Amphibian sleep has been studied and sleep patterns have not been found, he said, but perhaps scientists need to check again.

In humans, REM sleep is closely associated with dreaming. So do Australian dragons dream? There's no way to be sure right now, Laurent said. The answer may also depend on how you define dreaming. Under a strict definition in which dreaming requires higher cognition, the answer might be no. But if dreaming were defined as a replay of brain activity during sleep that resembles brain activity during wakefulness, lizards might well dream, Laurent said.

""Maybe in a few years, we'll be able to tell you,"" he said.

392,"Not in a traditional sense but they do display a circadian rhythm, drooping their branches at night and rising again just before the sun rises. Other flowers and trees open and close leaves/petals at certain times regardless of sunlight exposure. ",http://www.livescience.com/54864-do-trees-sleep.html,"After a long a long day of photosynthesizing, do trees fall asleep?

It depends on how you define ""sleep,"" but trees do relax their branches at night, which might be a sign of snoozing, scientists said.

In the only reported study to look at tree siestas, researchers set up lasers that measured the movements of two silver birch trees (Betula pendula) at night. One tree was in Finland and the other in Austria, and both were monitored from dusk until morning on dry, windless nights in September. This was close to the solar equinox, when daylight and nighttime are about equal. [What Is the Oldest Tree in the World?]

The laser scanners used infrared light to illuminate different parts of the tree, each for fractions of a second. This provided enough detail to map each tree within minutes, the researchers said.

The silver birches' branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found.

Trees might sleep after dark, according to precise laser measurements that detected the plants' branches drooping at night. (Image credit: Eetu Puttonen)

""Our results show that the whole tree droops during night, which can be seen as position change in leaves and branches,"" study lead author Eetu Puttonen, a researcher at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, said in a statement. ""The changes are not too large, only up to 10 centimeters [4 inches] for trees with a height of about 5 meters [16 feet].""

It's unclear if the sun ""woke up"" the trees or if they relied on their own internal circadian rhythm, the researchers said. But ""the fact that some branches started returning to their daytime position already before sunrise would suggest this [internal circadian clock] hypothesis [is right],"" the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online on Feb. 29, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.

The finding isn't too surprising, but oddly enough it hadn't been studied until now, the researchers said. Most living organisms have day and night circadian rhythms, and any gardener will notice that some plants open their flowers in the morning and that some trees close their leaves at night, the researchers said.

The famed botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) found that flowers confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed, and naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) noted that the nocturnal movement of leaves and stalks on plants looked like sleep.

However, their studies concentrated on small plants grown in pots. The finding in trees represents the first study to use lasers to precisely measure the nighttime movements of wild trees, the researchers said.

The tree study didn't address why the branches and leaves drooped at night, but it's likely related to the turgidity, or the internal water pressure within the tree, the researchers said.

""Plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cells, which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis,"" said study co-author András Zlinszky, a researcher at the Centre for Ecological Research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. [How Tall Can Trees Grow?]

The researchers said in the future, they plan to examine the water movement within each tree and compare it to measurements made by the laser scans. ""This will give us a better understanding of the trees' daily tree water use and their influence on the local or regional climate,"" Puttonen said.

But is it safe to drink blood?

Related: How much blood is in the human body?

In very small amounts (say, a few teaspoons), and if the blood is free from pathogens (such as the many blood-borne diseases), blood might not harm you. Beyond that, watch out.

The strange fact is, blood, when drank, is toxic. When confined to places where blood is supposed to be — such as the heart, vessels, and so on — it is essential for life. But when ingested it's a very different story. Of course all toxins have doses, and just as a tiny bit of poison won't necessarily harm you, the more you eat or drink, the greater the danger.

Because blood is so rich in iron — and because the body has difficulty excreting excess iron — any animal that consumes blood regularly runs a risk of iron overdose. While iron is necessary for all animals (and indeed most life), in high doses it can be toxic. This condition, called haemochromatosis, can cause a wide variety of diseases and problems, including liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders.

Even so, blood-feeding in humans seems to be more common than one might expect. John Edgar Browning of Georgia Tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a BBC article that thousands of people across the United States drink blood for various reasons. Some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by Browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn't overdo the blood meals: ""No vampire I’ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood,"" Browning said, according to BBC.

Unlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. According to Katherine Ramsland in her book ""The Science of Vampires"" (Penguin Putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, ""requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. When ingested, the blood goes through a tract that's adapted for extracting nutrients. Research on this system suggests that bats have a mucous membrane along the intestinal tract that acts as a barrier to prevent too much iron from getting into their bloodstreams.""

You, however, are not a vampire bat. Because humans did not evolve such an iron-extracting mechanism, drinking blood can kill us.

If you're thinking of sampling human blood, make sure there's a doctor handy — for you, not your victim.

The leaf uses a special silk material that makes it possible for chloroplasts to live and do their thing, and chloroplasts are where the magic of turning CO2 into oxygen happens. Chloroplasts become the engine of the leaves that only need CO2 and sunlight as 'fuel' to run, and emits oxygen as its 'waste.' The engine's process is called photosynthesis, and the chloroplasts of a leaf is where photosynthesis happens.

396,Yes.,http://www.livescience.com/55086-deep-breathing-stress.html,"A new app from Apple coaches you through breathing exercises, but do these exercises really help reduce stress?

This week, Apple announced a number of new features for the Apple Watch, including an app due out this fall called Breathe, which will ""encourage users to take a moment in their day to do deep breathing exercises for relaxation and stress reduction,"" the company said in a statement.

The app will guide users though a timed breathing session, lasting 1 to 5 minutes. The watch can track a user's heart rate, and so at the end of a session, users will see a summary of their heart rate data, Apple said.

Although some experts recommend up to 20 minutes of breathing exercises a day, just 5 minutes of breathing exercises can help people feel calmer and refreshed, said Nancy Harazduk, director of the Mind-Body Medicine Program at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C.

Studies suggest that deep-breathing exercises may reduce certain types of stress and anxiety, and can temporarily lower blood pressure. But many of these studies have been small, so more research is needed to learn more about the exact benefits of deep-breathing exercises, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

Deep breathing is a type of relaxation technique that is intended to counteract the body's normal response to stress, the ""fight or flight"" response. Deep breathing lowers heart rate and reduces levels of stress hormones, according to the NCCIH.

And because deep breathing dilates blood vessels, it can also lower blood pressure, Harazduk said .

In addition, when you breathe deeply, you take in more oxygen, which may help improve your mental concentration and release endorphins that increase feelings of well-being, she told Live Science .

Focusing on breathing can also take your mind off stressful thoughts. ""One of the ways of letting go thoughts of anxiety or stress is by focusing on our breathing,"" Harazduk said. [11 Tips to Lower Stress]

Studies show that deep breathing and other relaxation techniques may reduce anxiety in people undergoing certain medical procedures, such as breast biopsies or dental treatment, the NCCIH said. A 2013 study from researchers in South Korea found that burn patients who practiced breathing exercises had lower scores on measures of pain and anxiety when doctors treated their burns, compared with people who didn't practice the breathing exercises.

Deep breathing might also help with some day-to-day stresses. A 2013 study from researchers at Tufts University found that people who had anxiety about taking math tests performed better on the tests, and reported feeling calmer, if they practiced a breathing exercise beforehand.

However, breathing exercises by themselves may not be the best treatment for people with generalized anxiety disorder, a mental health condition in which people find it hard to control their anxiety, according to the NCCIH. Studies suggest that people with generalized anxiety disorder who are treated with psychotherapy do better than those who practice relaxation techniques alone.

And although breathing exercises can lower blood pressure in the short term, it's not certain how long these effects last. The Food and Drug Administration approved a device called Resperate, which helps people slow their breathing, to reduce stress and lower blood pressure. A review study conducted by the British Hypertension Society, which included nearly 500 patients, found that the device did lower blood pressure, by about 3.7 millimeters of mercury for systolic and 2.5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure, on average.

But the longest-duration study in the review was nine weeks. The Society said that, because the effect was small and the studies were short, it could not recommend Resperate at this time.

Deep-breathing techniques should not be used as a replacement for conventional care, or to postpone seeing a doctor for a health problem, the NCCIH said.

The Breathe app will be available in the fall with the next update to the Apple Watch operating system, called watchOS 3.

(There are no results of someone actually drinking only water for a month, the article only discusses the benefits of water in general.) ",http://www.lifebuzz.com/drink-water/,"Water is crucial to basically everything in our bodies. When it comes to drinking water, there are two things that most of us know: One, water is good for us (Probably better than anything else). Two, most of us don't drink enough of it -- after all, it's pretty tough to get those eight eight-ounce glasses each and every day. But do you know the specific reasons why water is great for you, beyond your average run-of-the-mill hydration? From blood to heart health to bones and skin, water can be beneficial on virtually every level and we've compiled some information that will encourage you to make sure you stay hydrated. And, now that it's summer, you really can't argue with at least eight glasses of water a day: It will keep you healthy, cool, and totally energetic during the heat of these oppressive summer days. Find out why you shouldn't skimp on the H2O -- all summer long and beyond.After all, 90% of your body is water -- it needs to be replenished in order to function properly.

But there's actually a lot that people don't know about the benefits of drinking water. And it's more than just quenching your thirst.

For starters, water can help you lose weight. And it contributes to weight loss in more ways than one.

For starters, water helps satiate you. People who drink more water have less of a tendency to overeat, because they know when they are full. Nicola Locatelli

When it comes to weight loss, water also acts as a detoxifier. Think about it: Most other drinks have sugar, which lead to weight gain. All water does is help flush out those nasty toxins. USAID U.S

It can also increase your metabolism. Drinking as much water as possible boosts your metabolism by up to 24%. Drink ice cold water for best results. as it shocks your system into working just a bit harder. Helga Weber

Beyond weight loss, water has a number of other benefits as well. There's basically not a single part of the body that healthy water intake doesn't help. Aikawa Ke

For starters, it keeps your heart healthy by keeping your blood thin. Water prevents your blood from getting too thick, making heart attacks less of a threat, and to keep clots from forming.

It also helps keep your brain sharp. A recent study showed that drinking 8 to 10 cups of water a day can increase your brain power by up to 30%. Staying hydrated can help increase mental clarity and focus as well.

And it's not just milk that keeps your bones healthy. Water increases bone strength by adding a protective barrier around them, and strengthening cartilage. monkeywing

Frequent water consumption can help slow down the aging process. It really makes the skin healthy and young looking by stimulating collagen and cell reproduction. refeelwater / instagram

Water also decreases your risk of stroke. The same way that water can reduce your risk of heart attack, studies have shown that it can also prevent strokes.

Not to mention the positive effect it has on your joints. It also increases flexibility and keeps the connective tissue strong. In other words, drinking water will totally keep your yoga game strong. wallace_Lan

400,"No one is sure, but if they do it has no smell. ",http://www.dailydot.com/geek/do-birds-fart/?fb=ss&prtnr=mentalfloss,"Have you ever wondered, “Do birds fart?” No? Well maybe now we’ve sparked your curiosity.

They don’t fart—detectably. There’s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn’t seem like anyone has ever truly observed—or more importantly, measured—a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate?

As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don’t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird’s gastrointestinal tract, he’d be concerned something was wrong with the bird.

But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there’s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected.

In another blog post, she describes the only written account she’s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master’s thesis on blue jays.

One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas.

Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod’s observation.) He also acknowledges that the “wisp of whitish gas” could also have simply been water vapor—steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog’s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)

It’s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that “the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment” and break down into its smellier components—namely sulfur. So if birds don’t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn’t smell it.

Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.

But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air?

As far as we could tell, this isn’t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab’s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart “in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.” He also said that he’s never personally noticed a bird fart.

Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying “excuse me” after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird’s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. And without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.",2016-06-15 08:18:38
401,"To prevent the possibility of contaminating the water with harmful microbes, since heating the robot enough to truly sterilize it would also destroy its internal systems. ",http://mentalfloss.com/article/69391/why-curiosity-rover-forbidden-collecting-water-mars,"In 2015 NASA announced that they found definitive evidence of liquid water on Mars. But while obtaining a physical sample would revolutionize science, it’s forbidden by international law.

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 prevents every nation on Earth from sending a mission, robot or human, close to a water source in the fear of contaminating it with life from Earth [PDF]. In its 140-million-mile journey from Earth to Mars, it’s possible that Curiosity has carried harmful microbes all the way from home. Even though NASA tries its best to sterilize all space-traveling equipment before launch by subjecting it to intense ultraviolet light, it still might harbor microbial hitchhikers.

In theory, NASA could turn up the heat and radiation to a level pretty much guaranteed to destroy any microbial life—but that could also end up wiping out the rover’s internal systems. ""In order to be completely sterile, they'd have to use really powerful ionizing radiation or heat, both of which would damage the electronics,” University of New South Wales astrobiologist Malcolm Walter told Fairfax Media. ""So they go as far as they dare.""

Another issue that would prevent Curiosity from investigating the water source is the terrain itself. The slopes where the streaks formed are steep and therefore difficult to navigate. Future Mars rovers could be designed with this hurdle in mind, and they could also come equipped with DNA sequencers to test for life or 3D-printing capabilities to build smaller bots with little to no chance of being contaminated.

Unfortunately, it’s too late for NASA modify the next generation of Mars rovers, which is set to launch in 2020. The European Space Agency says it plans to send an organic molecule analyzer on its 2018 ExoMars mission, though they still wouldn’t be able to test Martian water unless they could guarantee 100 percent sterilization.

Thank you Sam!",http://mentalfloss.com/article/80997/why-does-salt-kill-slugs,"Salt and pepper go together, but salt and slugs don’t pair so well. If you’ve ever battled the slimy gastropods in your garden (or just had a sadistic bent as a kid), you know that a few pinches of salt can kill them. But why? What is it about salt that causes the creepy crawlies to wither?

The answer, in a word, is osmosis: the process that occurs when a solution meets a permeable membrane. A solution is a homogenous mixture of two (or more) substances where one substance, the solute, is dissolved in the other, the solvent. When you have a solution on both sides of a permeable membrane, the solvent tends to pass through the membrane to whichever side has more solute so that concentration on both sides is evened out. That’s osmosis.

A slug has quite a bit of water inside of it, and the cells that make up its skin have highly permeable membranes. When you sprinkle salt on a slug, it mixes with the water in the mucus that the slug secretes to help it move around, creating a salt-water solution. That solution has a higher salt concentration than the inside of the slug, so osmosis occurs and water from the slug’s skin cells passes through the membranes to dilute the solution and even things out. If you use enough salt, the slug will lose so much water that it dehydrates, dies, and winds up looking pretty shriveled.

Humans can handle salt without the same thing happening because our skin isn’t as permeable as a slug’s. Put some salt in your eye, though, and you’ll get a small sense of what the slug is going through.",2016-06-14 11:30:00
403,"Triclosan, which scientists speculate may cause imbalances in gut bacteria. ",http://www.healthiestblog.com/2016/06/ingredient-consumer-products-damage-health.php,"Many consumer products contain this common antimicrobial agent which can have a negative impact on the human health.

Triclosan is a synthetic antimicrobial agent that can upset bacterial communities in the gut, a new study suggests.

Use of triclosan can also lead to ‘superbugs’ which are bacteria that are fully resistant to antimicrobials (e.g. antibiotics).

Triclosan was first introduced in the 1970s in hospital scrub soap and is now found in many consumer products, such as:

toys,

cosmetic products,

deodorants,

toothpastes,

mouth washes,

shampoos,

detergents,

bedding,

kitchen utensils,

cutting boards,

trash bags,

and surgical cleaning treatments.

Triclosan is absorbed through the skin easily and traces can be found in most people’s urine.

Dr Thomas Sharpton, an author of this study said:

“There has been a legacy of concern about exposure to microbial pathogens, which has led to increased use of these antimicrobial products. However, there’s now a growing awareness of the importance of the bacteria in our gut microbiome for human health, and the overuse of antibiotics that can lead to the rise of ‘superbugs’. There are consequences to constantly trying to kill the bacteria in the world around us, aspects we’re just beginning to understand.”

Exposure to triclosan makes changes to the microbial community structure and the diversity of microorganisms.

Also, some bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae are vulnerable and some — such as those in the Pseudomonas family — are resilient to the impact of triclosan.

Scientists believe that these changes can imbalance the bacteria in the gut, which in turn contributes to severe illnesses in humans.

Dr Christopher Gaulke, lead author of the study, said:

“Clearly there may be situations where antibacterial agents are needed. However, scientists now have evidence that intestinal bacteria may have metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune and neurological impacts, and concerns about overuse of these agents are valid. Cumulative impacts are also possible. We need to do significantly more evaluation of their effects, some of which might be dramatic and long lasting.”

The gut microbiome is vital for human health as it improves immune system function, produces micronutrients and stops the growth of pathogens in the body.

Abnormality in the gut microbiome can lead to conditions such as malnutrition, arthritis, diabetes and heart disease.

The study was published in PLOS ONE (Gaulkeet al., 2016).

404,"A diet high in fat. 
Thank you Andy!",http://www.healthiestblog.com/2016/06/diet-starves-brain.php,"Consumption of this diet starves the brain of much-needed glucose, a new study shows.

Consumption of high-fat-content foods causes reduction of glucose levels in the brain, a new study shows.

Three days of a high-fat diet in mice led to a depletion of blood glucose reaching the brain and unbalanced the body.

It took more than four weeks for the brain to restore the sugar uptake at a cost to the rest of the body.

Glucose is the primary fuel and the main source of energy for the brain.

When the brain does not get the fuel, this will affect cognitive skills and memory.

Scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Germany examined the mice’s brains to see how a high-fat diet affects them and how this can lead to diabetes and obesity.

Dr Alexander Jais, the study author, said:

“A high-fat diet reduces the uptake of blood glucose into the brain in as little as three days. So the brain is starving, even though the mice are consuming a lot of calories daily. Responsible for this is the protein GLUT-1, which is the most important glucose transporter at the blood-brain barrier.”

Free saturated fatty acids can have a toxic effect on the blood-brain barrier cells and reduce the GLUT-1 transporter.

The brain has no way to store glucose and some areas of the brain actually lack glucose and they need to get it immediately from the blood stream.

These areas include the cerebral cortex — which are responsible for learning and memory — and hypothalamus which controls the metabolism.

To compensate for the lack of energy, the brain takes action by using macrophages.

Macrophages are particular cells in the immune system and they can produce the growth factor VEGF.

This growth factor is part of the system that restores the oxygen supply to tissues and they can increase the production of GLUT-1.

The research team was able to measure the glucose levels in mice which were on high-fat diet.

They found that the glucose uptake in the brain will still reduce in mice that lack this growth factor.

Dr Jais said:

“As a result of this, the mice learn more slowly and have impaired memory.”

When the diet is high in fat the brain is looking for the sugar and to satiate its need will impact the rest of the body.

Dr Jais explained:

“We call it the selfish brain, because it gets its glucose by stimulating the body’s appetite for sweet foods and in the long run preventing the uptake in muscles and fat. The cells in the musculature are becoming resistant to insulin, the hormone that normally regulates glucose uptake in the cells of these organs. Ultimately, this leads to the development of diabetes.”

The study was published in Cell (Jais et al., 2016).

406,"Statistics show no positive academic effects, and studies show negative health effects. ",http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/homework-could-have-impact-kids-health-should-schools-ban-it/,"Reformers in the Progressive Era (from the 1890s to 1920s) depicted homework as a “sin” that deprived children of their playtime. Many critics voice similar concerns today.

Yet there are many parents who feel that from early on, children need to do homework if they are to succeed in an increasingly competitive academic culture. School administrators and policy makers have also weighed in, proposing various policies on homework.

So, does homework help or hinder kids?

For the last 10 years, my colleagues and I have been investigating international patterns in homework using databases like the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). If we step back from the heated debates about homework and look at how homework is used around the world, we find the highest homework loads are associated with countries that have lower incomes and higher social inequality.

Does Homework Result In Academic Success?

Let’s first look at the global trends on homework.

Undoubtedly, homework is a global phenomenon; students from all 59 countries that participated in the 2007 Trends in Math and Science Study (TIMSS) reported getting homework. Worldwide, only less than 7% of fourth graders said they did no homework.

TIMSS is one of the few data sets that allow us to compare many nations on how much homework is given (and done). And the data show extreme variation.

For example, in some nations, like Algeria, Kuwait and Morocco, more than one in five fourth graders reported high levels of homework. In Japan, less than 3% of students indicated they did more than four hours of homework on a normal school night.

TIMSS data can also help to dispel some common stereotypes. For instance, in East Asia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan – countries that had the top rankings on TIMSS average math achievement – reported rates of heavy homework that were below the international mean.

In the Netherlands, nearly one out of five fourth graders reported doing no homework on an average school night, even though Dutch fourth graders put their country in the top 10 in terms of average math scores in 2007.

Going by TIMSS data, the US is neither “A Nation at Rest” as some have claimed, nor a nation straining under excessive homework load. Fourth and eighth grade US students fall in the middle of the 59 countries in the TIMSS data set, although only 12% of US fourth graders reported high math homework loads compared to an international average of 21%.

So, is homework related to high academic success?

At a national level, the answer is clearly no. Worldwide, homework is not associated with high national levels of academic achievement.

But, the TIMSS can’t be used to determine if homework is actually helping or hurting academic performance overall, it can help us see how much homework students are doing, and what conditions are associated with higher national levels of homework.

We have typically found that the highest homework loads are associated with countries that have lower incomes and higher levels of social inequality – not hallmarks that most countries would want to emulate.

Impact Of Homework On Kids

TIMSS data also show us how even elementary school kids are being burdened with large amounts of homework.

Almost 10% of fourth graders worldwide (one in 10 children) reported spending multiple hours on homework each night. Globally, one in five fourth graders report 30 minutes or more of homework in math three to four times a week.

These reports of large homework loads should worry parents, teachers and policymakers alike.

Empirical studies have linked excessive homework to sleep disruption, indicating a negative relationship between the amount of homework, perceived stress and physical health.

What constitutes excessive amounts of homework varies by age, and may also be affected by cultural or family expectations. Young adolescents in middle school, or teenagers in high school, can study for longer duration than elementary school children.

But for elementary school students, even 30 minutes of homework a night, if combined with other sources of academic stress, can have a negative impact. Researchers in China have linked homework of two or more hours per night with sleep disruption.

Even though some cultures may normalize long periods of studying for elementary age children, there is no evidence to support that this level of homework has clear academic benefits. Also, when parents and children conflict over homework, and strong negative emotions are created, homework can actually have a negative association with academic achievement.

Should There Be “No Homework” Policies?

Administrators and policymakers have not been reluctant to wade into the debates on homework and to formulate policies. France’s president, Francois Hollande, even proposed that homework be banned because it may have inegaliatarian effects.

However, “zero-tolerance” homework policies for schools, or nations, are likely to create as many problems as they solve because of the wide variation of homework effects. Contrary to what Hollande said, research suggests that homework is not a likely source of social class differences in academic achievement.

Homework, in fact, is an important component of education for students in the middle and upper grades of schooling.

Policymakers and researchers should look more closely at the connection between poverty, inequality and higher levels of homework. Rather than seeing homework as a “solution,” policymakers should question what facets of their educational system might impel students, teachers and parents to increase homework loads.

At the classroom level, in setting homework, teachers need to communicate with their peers and with parents to assure that the homework assigned overall for a grade is not burdensome, and that it is indeed having a positive effect.

Perhaps, teachers can opt for a more individualized approach to homework. If teachers are careful in selecting their assignments – weighing the student’s age, family situation and need for skill development – then homework can be tailored in ways that improve the chance of maximum positive impact for any given student.

I strongly suspect that when teachers face conditions such as pressure to meet arbitrary achievement goals, lack of planning time or little autonomy over curriculum, homework becomes an easy option to make up what could not be covered in class.

Whatever the reason, the fact is a significant percentage of elementary school children around the world are struggling with large homework loads. That alone could have long-term negative consequences for their academic success.

407,"“Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up – there's a way out.” 
Thank you Gab for the link!",http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/stephen-hawking-gives-some-beautiful-advice-depression/,"World-renowned scientist Stephen Hawking is known for providing us with complex yet invaluable insights into space, time, and the nitty-gritty of theoretical physics. However, in a recent talk, the iconic physicist applied his brilliant mind to a more emotional matter.

Hawking gave a poignant message to people suffering from depression, making a poetic comparison between depression and a black hole – no matter how dark they seem, neither are impossible to escape.

Hawking said: “The message of this lecture is that black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought.

“Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up – there's a way out.”

He gave the speech in front of a crowd of over 400 people on Thursday evening, January 7, as part of the Reith lecture at the Royal Institute in London. The lecture was scheduled for November last year, but had to be postponed due to Hawking’s poor health.

Hawking, who turned 74 the day after the lecture, has lived with motor neuron disease for almost 53 years – despite being told he had just two years to live when diagnosed in 1963.

Speaking to the same audience, his daughter Lucy noted Hawking’s incredible mental fitness – both intellectually and emotionally.

“He has a very enviable wish to keep going and the ability to summon all his reserves, all his energy, all his mental focus and press them all into that goal of keeping going,” she said.

“But not just to keep going for the purposes of survival but to transcend this by producing extraordinary work – writing books, giving lectures, inspiring other people with neurodegenerative and other disabilities.”

For those lucky enough to have access to BBC Radio 4 , you’ll be able to listen to the full lecture through two broadcasts on January 26 and February 2 at 9 a.m.

A recent survey asked participants: ""if you were at a restaurant, which critter would make you drop your fork: Rodents, cockroaches, flies, ants, or snakes?"" 61% chose cockroaches. But scientists warn that flies are actually two-times more likely to spread germs - specifically those ubiquitous, hard-to-swat houseflies.

So what's the science behind this? Well, flies eat some of the grossest things imaginable: Poop, garbage, rotting animal carcasses. Another fact about flies is that they can't chew, so in order to eat, they spit-up enzymes onto their food, which dissolves it and lets them slurp it up.

RELATED: Flies Use Fighter Pilot Maneuver to Avoid Swatting

Even though it's probably the grossest thing imaginable, it's actually the bacteria and viruses that get stuck to their body that spreads disease and makes people sick, not their enzymatic spit-up. They only need to touch your food for a second for their legs or the tiny hairs all over their bodies to transfer germs from all those nasty things they eat onto what you're eating. And since flies can transfer serious, contagious diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid, it's probably best if you avoiding eating things that a fly lands on.

Are you the type of person who throws out your food if a fly lands on it? Have you become one after watching this video? Let us know in the comments section below because we'd love to hear from you.

414,"Some researchers claim that because humans are so powerful, yet so sensitive to Earth procceses (like weather), humans were brought by aliens 60k-200k years ago. ",http://www.lifecoachcode.com/2016/04/18/humans-did-not-evolve-on-earth/,"This year, other scientists have argued that life originated on Mars, due to a mineral found in Martian meteorites, thought to be crucial to the genesis of life.

BUT, a new book by American ecologist Dr. Ellis Silver offers arguments, based on human physiology, that humans as species may not have evolved alongside other life on Earth – but arrived from elsewhere, brought here by aliens as recently as a few tens of thousands of years ago.

This is a BIG claim, however, the facts that Silver puts on the table will make you say “how did I not realized this sooner!!”

Silver, an environmentalist who is currently working with the effort to clean plastic debris from the Pacific, says his book aims to provoke debate – and is based on scientific work on the difference between humans and other animals.

“The Earth approximately meets our needs as a species, but perhaps not as strongly as whoever brought us here initially thought,” Silver said in an interview with Yahoo news.

“Mankind is supposedly the most highly developed species on the planet, yet is surprisingly unsuited and ill-equipped for Earth’s environment: harmed by sunlight, a strong dislike for naturally occurring foods, ridiculously high rates of chronic disease, and more,”

Dr. Ellis says that humans might suffer from bad backs because they evolved on a world with lower gravity.

He also says that it is strange that babies’ heads are so large and make it difficult for women to give birth, which can result in fatalities of the mother and infant.

“No other truly native species on this planet has this problem,” he says. Silver also points out to the “extra” 223 genes in human beings, which are not found in any other species, and to the lack of a fossil “missing link”.

“Lizards can sunbathe for as long as they like – and many of them do. We can just about get away with it for a week or two. But day after day in the sun? Forget it. You might as well just lie down on the freeway and wait for a bus to hit you.” We are dazzled by the sun, which is also odd, says Silver – most animals are not.

“We are all chronically ill,” says Silver.

“Indeed, if you can find a single person who is 100% fit and healthy and not suffering from some (perhaps hidden or unstated) condition or disorder (there’s an extensive list in the book) I would be extremely surprised – I have not been able to find anyone.” Silver continues.

It’s like we desperately try to hide the fact that we do not fully belong in this Nature we try to fit in.

We say that we evolved but, if we truly evolved here, shouldn’t we be more in connection with Nature instead of being less and less, to a point that we even harm life around us?

Something just does not seem right.

“I believe that many of our problems stem from the simple fact that our internal body clocks have evolved to expect a 25 hour day (this has been proven by sleep researchers), but the Earth’s day is only 24 hours. This is not a modern condition – the same factors can be traced all the way back through mankind’s history on Earth.”

There is another key element we usually tend to ignore.

Many people say that they don’t feel like they belong on Earth, nor feel at home here, says Dr. Ellis Silver.

And this fact is not something to see as irrelevant, especially not if the majority of the human population feels like this.

“This suggests (to me at least) that mankind may have evolved on a different planet, and we may have been brought here as a highly developed species.” says Silver

What if we migrated here from Mars? And this, believe it or not, is not as farfetched as it seems. Scientists recently discovered that Mars had a strong Magnetic field before it became a wasteland.

Mars is the only planet in our Solar System that has a day of 25 hours, it is further away from The Sun than Earth, it has weaker gravity and it was discovered that Mars had large amounts of water in the past.

What if there was some kind of destruction of global proportions and we had to migrate to save our species?

This would also prove the stories of Humanity being more evolved in the past, but because of an unknown incident we “fell” from “heaven” on earth, and went through a phase of forgetting.

“My thesis proposes that mankind did not evolve from that particular strain of life, but evolved elsewhere and was transported to Earth (as fully evolved Homo sapiens) between 60,000 and 200,000 years ago,” says Dr. Ellis Silver.

415,Some people are genetically better at sports. ,https://www.vox.com/2016/5/30/11767704/practice-doesnt-make-perfect,"I was a horrible lacrosse player in high school: bad at catching the ball, slow, and not very aggressive.

Yet I'd spend hours at a handball wall with my stick: throwing, catching, repeating. I played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games. Freshman and sophomore years, I made it onto the junior varsity team — a miracle.

By 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse. This is when my history teacher — the varsity coach — pulled me aside and suggested I shouldn't bother. I'd probably be cut, he said (adding that I was getting very good grades).

For me, practice did not make perfect. Lo and behold, I now have scientific validation.

A meta-analysis in Perspectives in Psychological Science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn't matter that much.

More precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other.

Even more simply: Some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone. There was a reason I lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field. They probably had a natural advantage on me.

""One important thing — that's easy to misunderstand— is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual,"" Brooke Macnamara, the lead author of the Perspectives paper, tells me. ""So if a person practices, they will get better. Almost across the board, practice should improve one’s performance.""

But it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. ""Essentially, learning rates vary,"" Macnamara says. ""Some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice.""

The analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played. Practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities.

Practice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play. Which suggests ""deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill,"" the study reports. The analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didn't change this figure much either.

So what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent?

Here's where we should note a limitation of studying practice: Researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty.

But Macnamara doesn't think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100.

""There’s probably not one huge contributor that’s accounting for everything else,"" she says.

Instead, there's likely a whole constellation of factors — some of which are genetic or biological in nature — that explain why some people are better athletes than others. They include:

Personality and perseverance

Propensity to get injured

Propensity to choke under pressure

Individual differences in maximum oxygen uptake

Differences in how we acquire muscle mass

Coordination

Height

Enjoyment of competition

""We have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] — different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes,"" she says. ""All of those things are important and interact with each other. Which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance.""

Overall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular ""10,000 hour rule,"" which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it. The research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesn't back that hypothesis up.

On the other hand, it's not like these findings are an excuse not to try.

""Eighteen percent is big,"" Macnamara says. ""We're trying to argue against these ideas that it's so important it accounts for nearly everything."" Practice matters, but it's unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid.

For the athletically un-inclined, like myself, it's a bit of a relief. It's okay if you can't make up the difference with practice, or if you're just a ""slow learner"" when it comes to sports. It's also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing you'll unlikely be the best.

Growing up, my dad was on a quest to find ""my sport"" — the activity I'd finally master. Lacrosse was the closest we came. But it was mostly a parade of failures. Baseball: Throw a ball at me and I'll be more likely to bruise than catch it. Soccer: I was much too slow. Basketball: All of the above. Tennis: I was cut from the middle school team.

I'm not a well-coordinated person, and that's just fine.

These days I stick to activities that don't involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing. I love physical activity. Life's just too short to spend it on activities you're horrible at.",2016-06-01 18:42:39
416,"As smoking rates have decreased, obesity rates have increased. ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/24/one-of-americas-healthiest-trends-has-had-a-pretty-unexpected-side-effect/,"The precipitous fall has offered a glimpse into what happens when a country quits smoking cigarettes. And the answer is a ton of good things. The dip has coincided with steep declines in the rate of lung cancer, the death rate associated with cardiovascular disease (it peaked in 1968) and a number of other negative health outcomes.

Story continues below advertisement

But it has also, interestingly, coincided with another trend that isn't quite as encouraging: the rise of obesity. And it's not unreasonable to think that the two might be at least somewhat related.

""No one would recommend cigarette smoking as a way to combat obesity,"" said Charles Baum, a professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University, and the author of a study published in the journal Review of Economics of the Household. ""But realistically, the decline in smoking might very well have had some effect on the rise of obesity.""

Baum, along with Shin-Yi Chou, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), wondered what, if any, changes in human behavior have played a role in the growing pervasiveness of obesity, which has doubled over the past quarter-century. So they tried to estimate how things beyond the obvious and more immediate shifts in things like diet and exercise might have contributed.

In order to approximate the effect of various socio-environmental factors — things such as changes in food prices, physical demands at work, urban sprawl, racial composition, age distribution and cigarette consumption — Baum and Chou used almost 30 years’ worth of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The survey gathered detailed information about the social and economic backgrounds, weight, height and many other characteristics of more than 12,000 youth. The researchers controlled for several variables, including age, education, income and work experience. And what they found is that nothing seemed to have had much of an effect at all. That is, aside from the changes in cigarette consumption.

""The decline in the prevalence of cigarette smoking didn't have a large effect, comparatively speaking, but it had an effect,"" said Baum. ""It can explain about as much as 4 percent of the increase in obesity, according to our estimates.""

The impact associated with the fall in cigarette consumption was the largest of all the factors the researchers tested — such as the rise of urbanization, the fall in national food stamp enrollment and the growth in the number of restaurants — and that held true in all three of the models they built to compare the various factors.

The cigarette diet

The connection between the national shift away from smoking and growth in the collective American gut isn't as far-fetched as it might seem.

Cigarettes are a well-known appetite suppressant, not just within popular culture, but also among scientists who have studied tobacco's effect on the body. There is a plethora of research that suggests nicotine tends to decrease food intake (including this recent peer-reviewed study, which was published in the journal Science). The reasons, outlined in a slightly older, 1991 study, include resultant changes to the nervous system, physical activity and preferences in food consumption.

And it hasn't just been shown that smoking cigarettes can lead to weight loss — it's fairly well-established that people tend to gain weight after quitting, too.

Story continues below advertisement

""We know smoking cessation leads to weight gain. That's pretty accepted,"" said Yoni Freedhoff, an obesity expert at the University of Ottawa. ""Of course, the amount of weight gain varies, but it can be as high as 12 to 20 pounds.""

The effect is so significant that a study conducted in the early 1990s, which found that ""major weight gain is strongly related to smoking cessation,"" noted that it's likely part of what makes it so hard for people to quit.

So what?

Despite the collective eagerness to pin the obesity epidemic, which now affects more than a third of all U.S. adults, on any one particular thing, the truth is that it's more likely the result of a complex web of many and varied societal shifts. There are things, of course, that contribute more than others — the rise of processed food, for instance, or the uptick in the number of calories Americans consume. But there are also smaller, overlooked factors that slip through the cracks, evading the broader discussion.

The fall of tobacco seems like it might very well be one of those things, as evidenced not only by Baum's study, but also by myriad studies undertaken over the years, which have built on our understanding of the relationship between smoking and weight.

""Obviously, it's hard to establish any causal relationship here, but I would definitely say it's plausible that the fall in smoking contributed to the rise in obesity,"" said Freedhoff, the obesity expert.

What exactly are we supposed to glean from the suggestion that the fall in smoking might have contributed to the rise in obesity? The answer is not that anyone should look back upon the days when more than half of the population smoked regularly with nostalgia. Rather, according to Baum, it's better to view the study's finding as more of a point of interest, a takeaway that allows us to look at how societal changes move like waves that ripple, touching other shifts, even if only slightly.

The fall in smoking ""is an overwhelmingly positive thing,"" he said. ""It's just useful to know what some of the side effects of quitting are. It's interesting to see how they might be contributing to national trends, like the rise in obesity.""",2016-05-30 23:21:02
417,The best age to marry is exactly at 32 to reduce the odds of divorce. ,https://www.fatherly.com/parenting-and-relationships/science-identifies-the-best-age-to-marry-still-debating-when-to-have-kids/,"Data geeks have been responsible for some of our most important discoveries over the past few years, including high-value baseball players, the nation’s best burrito, and now this: The ideal age to get married.

According to new research from The Institute Of Family Studies, it’s 32.

The report swings (and mostly misses) as a bunch of explanations, but states definitively that “prior to age 32 or so, each additional year of age at marriage reduces the odds of divorce by 11 percent. However, after that the odds of divorce increase by 5 percent a year.”

That’s cool if you’re thinking about popping the question, but how does it align with previous research on the best age to have kids?

According to multiple studies summarized in Twentysomething: Why Do Young Adults Seem Stuck? by Robin Marantz Henig and Samantha Henig, it depends on what you mean by “best.” Biologically, prime baby time for women is only ideal if they’re looking for a role on MTV’s Teen Mom. Kids born to 26-year-old moms are statistically least likely to have birth defects, but kids born to 32-year-olds have the lowest overall infant mortality.

If you want to tie the decision to the mother’s long-term physical well being it gets even more complicated — the answer depends on if you’re talking about energy levels, ailments and aches, chronic illnesses, or overall health. To save your calculator thumb, know that the average nets out at 31. But also know that the best age for a woman to give birth, in terms of her overall life expectancy, is 34.

That’s a lot of squishy data to divine a “best” age from, but how about this: Get married around 30 and then have your first kid before 32. Your marriage will last, your kid will have a long, healthy life, and your wife will … have to sacrifice a few years on the back end. Well, “best” is a relative term, isn’t it?",2016-05-29 15:48:43

Thank you Darko for sending this in!",http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-finally-know-what-stopped-mongol-hordes-from-conquering-europe,"In 1206, Genghis Khan, a fierce tribal chieftain from northern Mongolia, began to take over the world. The khan’s ruthless tactics and loyal horde swept across Asia.

One territory after another fell under the overwhelming force of the Mongol Empire, which would eventually stretch from the eastern shores of China. A series of successful forays in Hungary and Poland made even Europe seem within reach of conquering.

But this unstoppable wave of victories in Europe suddenly ended. Almost as soon as the Mongols set their sights set on Austria, they abruptly returned to Asia.

Historians could only guess why until now, since written accounts from the point of view of Mongol military leaders are sparse. But a new study in the journal Scientific Reports looked at a different kind of record to solve the mystery of the horde’s abrupt exit from central Europe: tree rings.

This wooden chronicle revealed that a cold and wet period set in for years, leading ""to reduced pastureland and decreased mobility, as well as hampering the military effectiveness of the Mongol cavalry"", according to a press release.

Here’s how the Mongols rose to power - and how natural climate change may have forced them to cut their losses and stop a fearsome war of attrition.

When Genghis Khan died in 1227, he left his son, Ogodei, a territory that extended from northeast China to the Caspian Sea, just north of modern-day Iran. In total, it measured an astounding 11 million square miles (28 million square km).

""Whether measured by the total number of people defeated, the sum of the countries annexed, or by the total area occupied, Genghis Khan conquered more than twice as much as any man in history,"" writes historian Jack Weatherford in his book, Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World.

After Genghis’ death, Ogodei Khan carried forward his father’s legacy. The khanate expanded to the east and west, conquering the remainder of northwest China and pushing into Russia, aided by a wet period that allowed the Mongol armies to bring thousands of horses across the largest desert in Asia: the Gobi.

By 1240, Kiev had been sacked and the horde was rapidly advancing west. Their cavalry and siege tactics were laying waste to the cities of Europe, and, perhaps more importantly, they brought along Chinese gunpowder.

This series of unqualified successes brought the vast Mongol army to Hungary in March 1241. King Bela IV fled his palace in Pest (now Budapest), and Ogodei’s armies slaughtered an estimated 1 million Hungarians: Troops, clerics, nobles, knights, and peasants. It was one of the bloodiest defeats of the medieval period.

In December of 1241, Ogodei Khan died unexpectedly. Some historians have argued that Batu, Ogodei’s nephew who had been leading the western campaign, turned back toward the Mongol capital of Karakorum for the election of a new leader.

But Batu never returned returned to Mongolia, instead remaining in southern Russia to rule the Golden Horde. Meanwhile, Ogodei’s wife, Toregene, took power as the Great Khatun.

An abrupt end

The following year, everything changed. The horde suddenly turned south, moving through modern-day Serbia, and then headed back through Russia. Though subsequent khans staged occasional raids on European cities, the major war campaign was over.

Several hypotheses exist as to why the army abandoned their western front, but, the authors of the new paper argue, none are fully sufficient to explain the change in course.

The authors sampled wood from five regions of Eurasia to track what the weather was like during the period of the Mongols’ most extensive reach.

Trees are especially sensitive to small changes in climactic conditions: in wet years, they add thick layers of bark to their trunks. In dry years, the rings are thinner, reflecting the lack of water to a tree.

They found the climate in Hungary and its surroundings were unusually cold and wet for about three years, from 1238 to 1241. The extra moisture and early spring thaw turned the Hungarian plains into marshes and swampland - unsuitable terrain for moving the thousands of horses the Mongol armies relied on for transportation and warfare.

The last year of the eastern European campaign, 1242, they note, was especially damp. This led to crop spoilage, further reducing the food supply for the khan’s hordes. Famine later set in and killed thousands in the region.

It’s likely that Ogodei’s commanders chose a southern route because of its relatively drier conditions, the authors write, directing them away from Europe.

What happened to the Mongols afterward? Ogodei Khan’s death kicked off a spate of power struggles among Genghis’ sons and grandsons, fracturing the Mongol Empire into pieces that never reunified.

His lineage, however, continued to found dynasties in India, China, Persia, and Siberia. The Mongol people continue to live in China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and modern-day Mongolia, where Genghis Khan’s portrait appears on currency, vodka, and cigarettes, and his name even graces Ulaanbaatar’s international airport.

As scientists gain the ability to examine the climate record in greater detail, we’re discovering more about how climate shaped history. Unusual climates probably allowed Polynesians to spread out across the South Pacific, led to the fall of an ancient metropolis in pre-colonial Mexico, and encouraged Attila the Hun’s campaign of terror against the Roman Empire 800 years before Genghis Khan.

The authors conclude that their study of the Mongolian withdrawal from Hungary, ""illustrates the incidence of even small climate fluctuations upon a historical event"".

It also hints at a lesson for our climate future: a few degrees is all it takes to change the course of human history.

YouTube is a great place to find blooper, snuggly kitten or music videos. Now, it’s also a place to post grand ideas for microgravity research studies. Two of those ideas actually got to fly to the International Space Station. The YouTube Space Lab competition provided just such an opportunity, and three students saw their research performed aboard the orbiting laboratory.

For then-high school students Dorothy Chen and Sara Ma of Troy, Mich. and Amr Mohamed of Alexandria, Egypt, the sky no longer is the limit for their research questions. Chen, Ma and Mohamed completed research investigations as winners of the YouTube Space Lab global contest. The competition invited 14- to 18-year-old students to submit two-minute videos via YouTube to propose physics or biology investigations for astronauts to perform aboard the space station. Their research was chosen out of more than 2,000 entries received from around the world.

The two winning studies looked at the anti-fungal properties of the bacteria Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) in microgravity, and the predatory behavior of Salticus scenicus and Phiddipus johnsoni, also known as a zebra jumping spider and a red-backed jumping spider, respectively. The results they received from their research informed them that microgravity can be a wily participant in a research study held aboard an orbiting laboratory in space.

In a live video stream with the space station, Chen, Ma, Mohamed and NASA astronaut Sunita Williams were interviewed by Bill Nye the Science Guy about the two investigations. “To see it working is just mind-blowing,” said Chen, after talking with Williams on the station about her project. “It’s weird,” remarked Ma, “it’s like we saw the prototype for our bacteria container, and now [Williams] is holding it. It’s just really surreal.”

Chen and Ma hypothesized that B. subtilis, a naturally occurring bacteria commonly used as an anti-fungal agent for agricultural crops, would have increased anti-fungal properties when grown in microgravity compared to the same bacteria produced on Earth. Their testing also added phosphates and nitrates to the B. subtilis nutrient source to see if the additives affected growth and anti-fungal strength. The phosphates and nitrates acted as nutrients to potentially boost growth of the bacteria. The outcome of their investigation aboard the space station showed that the least amount of growth in the bacteria occurred in microgravity as compared to bacteria produced on Earth. They found that microgravity had no effect on the degree to which phosphates and nitrates affect B. subtilis growth.

In reaction to the results of her study with Ma, Chen said, “It was a little difficult to make hypotheses about the reason for the results since we never directly interacted with our experiment, but we think it may have to do with the specific strain of B. subtilis that we used.” For additional study, “I would want to include a control strain,” added Chen.

When asked how the experience of having her research conducted aboard the space station impacted her career goals, Chen said, “It has made me much more curious about the possibilities of research aboard the space station or in microgravity in general.”

Mohamed, now a college student in California, was excited about seeing his zebra jumping spider research in action while talking with Williams in orbit. “The best scientists and astronauts are the ones who work on the station, and it’s an honor to have my own experiment be done there.”

Mohamed's research hypothesized that jumping spiders, like the zebra and red-backed species, would not be able to adapt their hunting abilities to microgravity. Jumping spiders do not build webs for catching their food, instead using their vision to hunt prey, jumping and striking with a fatal bite. This hypothesis was proven wrong while the investigation was conducted aboard the space station, as the spiders did adapt to microgravity to catch prey. “The results did indeed contradict my hypothesis, which was very exciting,” exclaimed Mohamed. “I think it is boring when experiments turn out as expected or when the universe behaves as observed.”

“This competition was by far the best experience of my life. It is something that will stay with me forever,” says Mohamed, when asked how the experience of having his research conducted aboard the space station impacted his career goals. “I am currently studying engineering at my [college] in California. I am involved with the Student Space Flight Initiative. I really want space exploration to be a part of my future.”

In appreciation of the YouTube Space Lab Project, NASA, the American Astronautical Society and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space recognized Zahaan Bharmal of Google for the project as a Top Education Application on the International Space Station in 2012. Bharmal acknowledged the importance of YouTube Space Lab and other space education programs as a key motivator for students to pursue careers in research and engineering and, in turn, further human space exploration. “The first man or woman to one day walk on Mars is, today, a child,"" said Bharmal. ""YouTube Space Lab—and programs like it—are so very important to those on Earth because they are helping to inspire this next generation of explorers who may one day find a new home beyond Earth.”

An infestation of ear maggots is a common problem in the tropics and subtropics - going by the name of aural myasis.

Sufferers usually complain of a buzzing in the ear and a smelly discharge - the fatality rate is 8% according to experts.

It is usually seen in children younger than 10 years of age or in debilitated individuals.

The best way to get rid of the infestation is to ""make them suffocate so they come to the surface"".

By Juan Cole | (Informed Comment) | —

The adoption of wind and solar for electricity generation around the world is happening at a growing pace, and the likelihood is that it will displace hydrocarbons in fifteen to twenty years (decades sooner than Big Coal, Big Oil and Big Gas expect). Here are some stories illustrating that stepped-up pace.

Germany’s wind power output is up by a third in the first five months of 2015 over the same period the previous year. In part, some offshore projects that had been delayed have started coming on line, adding 3 gigawatts of capacity. In part, Germany’s government plans to reduce incentives for wind and has already done so for solar, on the theory that these are now mature industries. The planned changes caused owners of planned wind turbine plants to rush to finish them so as to benefit from the more generous current policies. In 2015, it is expected that for the first time, Germany will generate more electricity via renewables like wind and solar than by its aging set of 8 nuclear reactors. The cost of electricity in Germany is historically low this year as a result of the wind and solar installations in the country, and is half what it is in Britain.

China added 5 gigawatts of new solar capacity in the first three months of 2015! That is nearly equivalent to all the solar installations ever built in Spain. China is going for 17 gigawatts of new solar capacity in 2015. That will make it about tied with Germany, currently the leading solar power in the world, with 33 gigawatts of installed coapacity.

The state of Maharashtra in India has announced a plan to nearly double its power generation from renewables over the next five years, with plans to have 7.5 gigawatts of solar energy and 5 gigawatts of wind by 2020. At the moment, 9% of the state’s energy comes from renewables,and this plan would bring the total to 15%. The plan is revenue-neutral, in part because of expected help from the Indian federal government. Maharashtra lies on the country’s west coast and includes the mega-city of Mumbai (Bombay), its capital. The state has a population of 114 million, making it more populous than the Philippines and nearly as populous as Mexico. That is, if it were an independent country, it would be no. 12 by population. The state’s annual gross domestic product is $233 billion, putting it in the same neighborhood as Iraq, Chile and the Philippines.

Wind power in Brazil doubled in the past year, and solar is up 62%. Brazil is looking to add 6 new gigawatts of electricity generation capacity in 2015.

The United Arab Emirates plans to add 100 megawatts of new solar PV capacity soon. By 2017 the largest solar plant in the Middle East will open, with a capacity of 200 megawatts. By 2021, the UAE plans to get 24% of its electricity from renewables. The UAE is a country of about 9 million, though only about 2 million of those are citizens. It has a GDP of about $400 billion annually, mainly income earned from petroleum exports. But Dubai has emerged as a finance hub and the country is diversifying away from oil. Unlike American CEO’s, the Gulf sheikhs are usually not in any doubt about climate change or the likelihood that the globe will have to give up burning hydrocarbons. The UAE is attempting to position itself as a major player in green energy markets via its Masdar corporation.

Why is all this happening? Because solar power and wind power are competitive with hydrocarbons even if we don’t figure in externalities. Their real price is rapidly falling. Externalities are things like pollution, which economists often do not figure into their formulas for profitability. If we considered externalities, then coal, gas and oil are worthless because they are so destructive. Burning them is like setting off multiple atomic bombs in the atmosphere. But even if you left a little thing like that out of your equations, solar and wind can now compete with other forms of energy in the global marketplace.

For instance, Dubai let a bid for a new solar PV plant that will generate electricity for only 6 cents a kilowatt hour. It would have cost the UAE more than that to build a natural gas plant. We are only at the beginning of a huge electricity price drop.

435,The Sun will collapse when it runs out of fuel (hydrogen) to counteract the immense gravity holding it together. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/physicist-brian-greene-just-explained-to-colbert-how-the-world-will-end,"When we get all caught up thinking about the zombie apocalypse, the robot revolution, or something a little more realistic, like say, an antibiotic-resistant superbug that could seriously wipe millions of us out, we're talking small-time 'end of the world' stuff. Robots might rise up against us and destroy humanity forever, but the world will keep on spinning, and the Solar System will still have eight planets (sorry Pluto).

But nothing is forever, no matter how many billions of years you've existed, and theoretical physicist Brian Greene just demonstrated to Colbert how a star like our Sun will end.

Now, we don't want to alarm you or anything, but at some point, our Sun is going to run out of fuel, collapse in on itself, and everything we know and love will die.

If you have kids, that's something you maybe want to give the delicate 'birds and the bees' treatment to when it comes time to explain that little nugget of truth to them, lest they end up like one of Louis CK's daughters, when he decided to marvel at the incredible, flaming violence of it all:

""She started crying immediately, crying bitter tears for the death of all humanity... and now she knows all of those things: she’s gonna die, everybody she knows is gonna die, they’re gonna be dead for a very long time, and then the Sun’s gonna explode. She learned that all in 12 seconds, at the age of seven.""

The sad futility of existence aside, the science behind how and why a star millions of times more massive than our Sun implodes in on itself is fascinating, and nobody explains it as clearly as Greene in the video above.

And he takes things one step further, by bringing a record-breaking Galilean canon into the studio to demonstrate just how far the shockwaves of destruction will emanate from a dying sun. Dude makes breaking a world record look suspiciously easy.

Watch the video above to find out more about our ultimate demise, and check out this video by Physics Girl if you can't get enough of those stacked balls:

Take a look at a bunch of women's OkCupid profiles and you'll be hard pressed to find one that says, ""I'm looking for a guy who makes me laugh, loves trying new foods, and — oh! knows how to spin a mean yarn.""

And yet new research suggests that storytelling prowess is a desirable quality in a guy — possibly because it signals that they're high-status. Men, on the other hand, don't seem to be fazed by women's ability to tell a good tale.

Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and SUNY Buffalo came to these conclusions after conducting a series of studies with hundreds of male and female undergrads as participants.

In one study, undergrads read descriptions of men and women, some of which specified that the man or woman tells great stories. Results showed that women found men who were good storytellers more attractive as long-term partners than men who were only decent storytellers, or men whose bios didn't mention storytelling ability at all.

Men, on the other hand, didn't rate women more attractive when those women were described as good storytellers.

The researchers also asked the participants to indicate whether they thought the man or woman would be popular, admired, and a good leader. Answers to these questions indicated how high-status the person seemed.

Sure enough, men who were supposedly good storytellers were perceived by women as higher status. Again, though, women who were supposedly good storytellers were not perceived by men as more attractive or of higher status.

At this point, it's hard to say for sure why women are drawn to men who can tell a good story. The authors suggest that ""storytelling ability reflects a man's ability to gain resources. Good storytellers may be more likely to influence others or to gain positions of authority in society.""

Story continues

Previous research has found that women prefer high-status guys, so this isn't especially surprising — what's new is the idea that storytelling ability is an indicator of status.

Of course, future research is necessary to see if watching and listening to a man tell a story is as appealing as reading a story he's written.

Yet this study adds to a growing body of research on the nonphysical characteristics that can make men attractive to women, like mindfulness and altruism. In some cases, these attributes seem to be even more important than a man's looks.

Bottom line: Women might not explicitly reveal that they're looking for a guy who can tell a good story — in fact, they might not even realize that's what they want. But if you want to impress a woman, consider ditching the pickup lines and starting with ""Once upon a time ..."" instead.

What if she takes a year or two off—is the gap on her resume counted as experience, or a strike against her? If she applies for a research grant, will she get it?

Today, February 11, is the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. This is the first such commemorative day dedicated to asking these questions and coming up with solutions to a problem that affects communities from the wealthiest, most urbane settings to the poorest corners of the globe.

In place after place, women and girls are lagging behind their male counterparts in the sciences. A quick look at the stats shows why the international community so urgently needs to do a better job of promoting women in science.

A Global Problem

Worldwide, women account for just 28 percent of all researchers. Even though enrollment numbers are up and more women are studying science, they’re not matching their male counterparts with PhDs and jobs with critical decision-making clout. And we cannot assume the status quo will gradually change over time as more of those women graduate with degrees in science, technology and engineering. “Gaps and barriers persist throughout the scientific research system,” notes a flagship UNESCO science report on this issue titled, Towards 2030.



Even in Europe and the United States, the numbers of women in positions of “leadership and prestige” remain stagnant despite a decade-long push for change. “Each step up the ladder of the scientific research system sees a drop in female participation until, at the highest echelons of scientific research and decision-making, there are very few women left,” the report says. Reasons cited include a host of cultural phenomena: the maternal wall or glass ceiling, lack of recognition and support for women in leadership, and bias—both conscious and subconscious.

The latter is particularly pernicious and difficult to change. “Science remains one of the few sectors where gender bias is common and considered acceptable by some,” according to UNESCO. There is a persistent underlying belief that women simply cannot do science as well as men—or that they are overly emotional and distracting to men.

When women are missing from classrooms and research labs, they are less likely to be invited to research councils, think tanks, and the editorial boards of scholarly journals. They will not move up to political forums and roundtables of global policymaking.

The UN decided to set aside one day—Feb. 11—each year to promote women in science because it is critical to the future of humanity, and this planet. This is not just about do-good, feel-good morality goals; it’s about health and prosperity, life and death. In countries where women and girls are denied education, child and maternal death rates are higher. But when women are educated and included in decision-making circles—in the family, the village, the country—economies grow and mortality rates decline.

Take, for example, climate change. As a whole, women suffer the effects of climate change more than men. “Since men tend to enjoy a higher socio-economic status, women are disproportionately affected by droughts, floods and other extreme weather events and marginalized when it comes to making decisions on recovery and adaptation,” according to UNESCO. Yet not nearly as many women as men work in scientific fields involving climate change adaptation strategies. Not nearly as many women as men have decision-making powers—at home or in the community—to determine the best strategies for family and cultural survival. Participants at last December’s COP21 talks in Paris noted a striking gender imbalance, “detrimental to taking action to save people from the ravages of climate change.”

Think, for a moment, about daily life in a traditionally patriarchal society. Let’s say you’re a girl in a remote village, somewhere up a mountain in Timor-Leste. You quit school at third or fourth grade because your mother needs your help in the kitchen and field. You marry young, leave your parents, and move into your husband’s home. His family pays a bride price for you, and by your culture’s standards, you essentially belong to him. You are “not independent to speak,” says Rosaria Martins da Cruz, director of HIAM Health, an NGO that fights malnutrition among mothers and kids. Your husband doesn’t want you to get a job, so you don’t. You have no income of your own. You spend your days in the confines of your hut and your land—caring for kids, tending livestock, weeding the garden. As a rural woman, you are “always in the home to look after the baby, cooking for the man, clean the house, do everything for the man and the kids,” da Cruz says.

Now let’s say it’s an El Niño year (like this one). The rains are late, and drought is expected. Your crops are dying, and people say it’s going to get worse with climate change. You’ve spent the money from last year’s harvest. There is only a little rice to eat, with a few chiles and greens. You feed your husband first. You feed your baby a mush of bland white rice, nothing else. You eat the last dregs yourself, after the others have finished—because that’s tradition, that’s your place in the family. You know it’s not enough nourishment for any of you. You know you’re all getting weaker. You go to church, you pray for rain. When it doesn’t come, sickness does. The neighbor’s baby dies. Then the old woman up the road does, too. You attend each funeral, and go to bed wishing you had the knowledge to make things better, wishing you knew where to begin. The next morning, you wake before dawn to fetch the water, you light the fire, and your daily routine repeats.

This is what it’s like for millions of rural women worldwide who are neither asked nor granted the opportunity to study, to leave the village, to learn and then return to make things better. When women are excluded from education and the pursuit of dreams, their communities are denied 50 percent of all opportunity to innovate and grow. For many women around the globe, their gender presents a double burden: they are born into the lowest rungs of society, and their culture keeps them there with little chance to advance.

This is something we all must work to change, in our homes and our communities—from Timor-Leste to the United States and beyond. We need Feb. 11 as a start to promote women and girls in science. But even more, we need women and girls in science every day, all year long.

Thank you Pat!",http://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-what-really-happens-to-your-body-when-you-swallow-gum,"You might have heard the rumours as a kid: Swallow gum and it will sit stubbornly in your stomach for seven long years.

But what does science have to say about that? Reactions, a video series from the American Chemical Society, traced the steps taken by our body’s digestive system to find out that while some of the gum we chew can survive digestion, it ""doesn’t mean the gum you swallowed in grade school is still there"". Phew.

Turns out there are three basic components of digestion: The first includes the mechanical processes that are required to process your food when you first ingest it, i.e. chewing.

The second focuses on the enzymes or proteins in your saliva and stomach that help break down that food. Last but not least are acids, which dissolve what’s left into something your body can comfortably pass through your intestines.

Traditionally, when you eat, your teeth and tongue work together to munch the food into small bits. Then your muscle movements push the food through the digestive tract until it is emptied into the stomach and churned with digestive juices, as shown below:

While this is happening, the enzymes in your saliva, stomach juices, and intestines drive chemical processes that allow you to convert that food into nutrients your body can use.

Then, the acids in your stomach get to work, dissolving what’s left of that food into a mush that your body can comfortably pass through your intestines and, eventually… dispose of.

But gum isn’t designed to be smoothly digested by your body like regular food. That’s because it contains either a natural or synthetic rubber base, which is what gives it its gummy consistency. Butyl rubber, commonly used in gum (as well as tires and basketballs, mm!), is a synthetic rubber that provides it with an ideal chewiness.

You’ve probably noticed that gum is unaffected by the crushing of your teeth - that’s kind of the point. So when you swallow the gum, it moves through your digestive tract into your stomach as one giant wad.

While your enzymes are able to break down the carbohydrates, oils, and alcohols in the gum as they would with regular food, the rubber base in the gum is basically immune to these enzymes.

Even the 'harsh brew' of acids in your stomach is no match for this rubber base. (Remember that rubber is so resilient that we use it in gloves for protection.) As a result, part of your gum survives all of your digestive system’s attempts to break it down.

But so do parts of a lot of other things you eat, like sunflower seeds or corn. So while that gum you swallowed is rebellious enough to stand up to your digestive processes, that doesn’t stop your muscles from eventually ushering it through your body and out the other end within a couple days.

",https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/nasa-is-a-jobs-program?utm_term=.dxmG6mPKlV#.xhVavmg3eR,"Although NASA touts its discoveries in space, the federal agency is, and has always been, about jobs on the ground. “Money aimed at science and research ends up with builders and contractors instead,” a former NASA deputy administrator said.

NASA / Via nasa.gov One piece of NASA's massive new rocket

Space adventure fans might enjoy NASA’s latest saga, the story of a rocket to nowhere that Congress wants, very badly, built in Alabama. Or they might be really pissed off. In its 2017 budget request, NASA asked Congress for $1.3 billion to build its next jumbo rocket. Last week, despite years of fighting with the Obama Administration over its plans to explore an asteroid with the rocket, the Senate Appropriations Committee not only granted the request, but gave the space agency an extra $995 million to build it. A surprise billion dollars may sound good. But while adding money to “Space Operations,” the Appropriations Committee also cut $660 million from NASA’s science, aeronautics, and space technology programs that build the telescopes, observatories, planes, and landers that make the agency so beloved. In justifying this decision, the committee wrote that the rocket “is the nation’s launch vehicle that will enable humans to explore space beyond current capabilities.” The futuristic space rocket, called the Space Launch System (SLS), won’t send any astronauts into space until at least 2023, and it doesn’t even have a destination. But that doesn’t seem to matter to lawmakers. Since the moon landings ended, NASA is and has always been a jobs program, more about dollars spent on the ground than discoveries made among the stars, with the SLS bonanza just the latest example. “It is more the politics of pork than the politics of progress,” former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver told BuzzFeed News. “There’s a long-time pattern at NASA where money aimed at science and research ends up with builders and contractors instead.”

NASA / Via nasa.gov Ratana Meekham, a technician at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama

The Senate space spending committee is headed by Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, and on the minority side by Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, both of whom have NASA centers in their states. The SLS (nicknamed the “Senate Launch System” after it was forced on NASA in 2010), will be built at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama, where a $45 million 15-story test stand for the rocket reached its intended height earlier this month. “The point is to spend money and create jobs the way the Soviet Union did on its rocket design bureaus,” Keith Cowing of NASA Watch told BuzzFeed News. The SLS — “a rocket to nowhere,” as Cowing put it — fits this pattern neatly because it provides thousands of jobs in space states. No one knows where it will go. Maybe to an asteroid (the Obama administration’s unloved notion), or to circle the moon, or boost astronauts on their way to Mars. Eric Berger, a reporter at Ars Technica decried the move to build the rocket ahead of a destination. Cuts also came to NASA’s “space technology” funding, a $130 million bite meant to keep aloft earth-observing satellites run out of Goddard Space Flight Center, based in Mikulski’s state of Maryland. As Berger said, “the motivation seems primarily to be keeping people employed.”

One problem with this approach is that you might end up with space rocket that doesn’t have any space technology — a habitat module, deep-space propulsion, landers — to actually let astronauts voyage to asteroids, or the moon, or Mars. You might spend billions on workers who maintain the rocket you’ve built, and not have any money left over to build the interplanetary survival gear needed to ever get to Mars, the ultimate goal of the space agency. It’s happened before, Garver said, with the the $100 billion International Space Station. “We had to spend all the money just to get it built, with very little left for science.” Scientists have long complained how little research takes place on the orbiting lab. NASA’s scientific advisory committee decided only this month to send a fact-finding group to the foundation that manages ISS research, after questioning its scientific productivity.

NASA Watch / Keith Cowing / Via nasawatch.com

“The critics are right, this isn’t a rational way to run a space program,” political science professor Harry Lambright of Syracuse University told BuzzFeed News. “But that doesn’t matter, because this is the way a space program will inevitably work in a democracy.” So it has always been for NASA, born in a moment of Cold War lunacy over the Soviet Union claiming the moon for communism, and looking for another space race to justify its budget ever since the glamour of Moon landings first wore off. In the 1960s, NASA administrator James Webb faced declining popular interest in the moon landing, responded by spreading NASA centers to politically important states, such as Lyndon Johnson’s Texas, California, Ohio, and Florida. NASA’s Stennis Space Center, which will build the rocket engines powering the SLS, is located in Mississippi, home to the chairman of the Senate’s overall spending committee, Sen. Thad Cochran. In a sense, that system is still working. NASA built the space shuttle in the 1970s in a decision largely shaped by Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign. Since then, the space agency has had to compete for Congressional dollars like every other federal agency, which means that politicians will always look to jobs as a reason for any Mars landings, Lambright said. “They can’t spend money that Congress doesn’t give them.” So, NASA will at least get a rocket out of the deal, he and others argue. “NASA is actually doing a very good job, in my view, of navigating to build a rocket while they can,"" Lambright said. ""That is what there is money to build."" The real problem, former NASA official Scott Pace of George Washington University told BuzzFeed News, is that the Obama administration’s plans to fly astronauts to an asteroid and then Mars are not very interesting to international or commercial partners, who would rather return to the moon. Building SLS lets NASA keep its options open if the next president decides to look to lunar landings instead, something that Obama seemed to rule out in a 2010 speech. Meanwhile, one commercial partner of NASA appears very much interested in Mars. SpaceX has announced that it will land an unmanned Dragon astronaut capsule on the Red Planet as early as 2018. That landing would depend on its yet-to-be-produced Falcon Heavy rocket, one almost as powerful as the SLS, carrying the capsule to Mars.

Planning to send Dragon to Mars as soon as 2018. Red Dragons will inform overall Mars architecture, details to come

That’s the same SpaceX that on April 8 demonstrated unparalleled rocket landing capabilities, by dropping one of its Falcon rockets onto an ocean barge after sending a satellite into orbit.

Might SpaceX privately building a big rocket in the next two years, and sending something to Mars, make SLS look redundant to politicians, finally ending NASA’s long cycle of rocket-building jobs programs? “That’s kind of optimistic, and I’m an optimist,” said Garver, who served as a space policy advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008. “I wouldn’t count on it.”

Sorry for long post. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/13-amazing-science-facts-you-never-learned-at-high-school,"We learn about some awesome science in high school - like Einstein's theory of relativity, the Periodic table, and DNA replication.

The knowledge we pick up there sets the foundations for all the other amazing things we go on to study. But science definitely doesn't end at high school, and it's once you take your learning to the next level that things get really interesting.

In no particular order, here are some mind-bendingly incredible facts that we didn't learn at high school, but wish we did. Because I certainly would have paid a whole lot more attention if my teacher had shared a few of these insights in class.

Side note: if you did learn about all of this and more at school, then you had a kick-ass teacher and you should probably tell them that.

1. Water can boil and freeze at the same time

Tenstone

Seriously, it's called the 'triple point', and it occurs when the temperature and pressure is just right for the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of a substance to coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. This video shows cyclohexane in a vacuum.

2. Lasers can get trapped in a waterfall

BuzzFeedYellow

Oh my gosh, yes. Not only is this an incredible example of total internal reflection, it also shows how fibre optic cables work to guide the flow of light.

3. We've got spacecraft hurtling towards the edge of our Solar System really, really fast

Clay Bavor/Twitter

We all know rockets are fast, and space is big. But sometimes when we're talking about how long it takes for us to get to distant parts of the Solar System (eight months to get to Mars, are you kidding me?) it can feel like our spacecraft are just crawling along out there.

This gif shows just how wrong that idea is by comparing the speed of the New Horizons probe, which flew past Pluto last year, to a 747 and SR-71 Blackbird.

4. An egg looks like a crazy jellyfish underwater

BIOSstation/YouTube

A cracked egg on land might make a big mess, but 18 metres (60 feet) below the surface of the ocean, the pressure on the egg is 2.8 times atmospheric pressure, and it holds it all together like an invisible egg shell. True story.

5. You can prove Pythagoras' theorem with fluid

00000000130/YouTube

Not buying what your maths teacher is selling when they tell you a2 + b2 = c2? You can actually prove it with liquid.

6. This is what happens when a black hole swallows a star

NASA

As the star gets sucked up into the black hole, a huge jet of plasma is burped out, spanning hundreds of light-years. ""When the star is ripped apart by the gravitational forces of the black hole, some part of the star's remains falls into the black hole, while the rest is ejected at high speeds,"" explains Johns Hopkins University researcher, Suvi Gezari.

7. You CAN see without your glasses

MinutePhysics

According to MinutePhysics, all you need to do is make a pinhole with your hand, which will help you focus the light coming into your retina. Sure, it won't give you 20/20 vision, but it's a good start if you've left your glasses at home.

8. This is how a face forms in the womb

BBC

Embryonic development is an incredibly complex process that scientists are still just beginning to understand. But one thing researchers have been able to map out is how the embryo folds to create the structures of the human face in the womb. We could watch this all day.

9. Popping your knuckles isn't necessarily bad for you

Vox

One researcher popped the knuckles of one hand for 60 years but not the other, and found no discernible difference in the amount of arthritis between the two of them at the end of his experiment.

Find out more in this video from Vox:

10. A single solar flare can release the equivalent energy of millions of 100-megaton atomic bombs

11. Cats always land on their feet, thanks to physics

As Smarter Every Day demonstrated with this awesome slow-mo footage, cats actually use the two halves of their bodies separately to ensure rapid rotation (don't try this at home).

12. You'd be better off surviving a grenade on land rather than underwater

Mark Rober

Those balloons? That's what would happen to your lungs if an explosion went off near you underwater.

13. If you spin a ball as you drop it, it flies

Veritasium

I mean, it really flies. It's thanks to the Magnus effect, which occurs when the air on the front side of a spinning object is going the same direction as its spin, which means it gets dragged along with the object and deflected back.

Meanwhile, the air on the other side of the ball is moving in the opposite direction, so the air flow separates.

Watch Veritasium explain it better than we ever could:

We could keep going... but the best part about science is that it discovers new things every day. Never stop learning.

“Thai food is delicious but sometimes very greasy,” BBDO writes in a project description, adding that the hundreds of stir-fry and deep fried dishes cooked with oil are one of the reasons that Thais have the second highest obesity rate in Southeast Asia. “Unhealthy eating behaviour is hard to change, and most Thai people go for what’s delicious. How can we help Thai people eat healthier without changing their regular meal?”

But 30 calories per meal is such a negligible amount that this is certainly not a silver bullet. A pound roughly equals 3,500 calories, so a dieter needs to reduce his or her caloric intake by 500 to 1,000 calories per day to lose about 1 to 2 pounds per week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The inhabitants of the Movile Cave are like no others. The “otherworldly” conditions of this Romanian cave, just a few miles west from the Black Sea, have been sealed up for around 5.5 million years. Although the air is poisonous and unbearably humid, this cocktail of factors has created a goldmine for biologists.

Fewer than 100 people have ever delved into the cave, according to BBC Earth . It was only discovered by humans in 1986, when workers of the Socialist Republic of Romania were looking for new ground to build a nuclear power plant. Nowadays, it is blocked off by the authorities and only accessible with special permission, although the central caverns are naturally “guarded” by a series of vertical shafts and narrow limestone tunnels.

Once in the depths of the cave, the air contains half of the amount of oxygen than usual and is high in carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. It is also pitch black and hasn’t seen sunlight for at least 5.5 million years.

457,"1.Understand and build language
2.Recognise and exploit hidden structures in data.
",http://www.sciencealert.com/what-makes-a-mathematical-genius,"The film The Man Who Knew Infinity tells the gripping story of Srinivasa Ramanujan, an exceptionally talented, self-taught Indian mathematician. While in India, he was able to develop his own ideas on summing geometric and arithmetic series without any formal training.

Eventually, his raw talent was recognised and he got a post at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked with G.H. Hardy until his untimely death at the age of 32 in 1920. Despite his short life, Ramanujan made substantial contributions to number theory, elliptic functions, infinite series, and continued fractions.

The story seems to suggest that mathematical ability is something at least partly innate. But what does the evidence say?

From language to spatial thinking

There are many different theories about what mathematical ability is. One is that it is closely tied to the capacity for understanding and building language. Just over a decade ago, a study examined members of an Amazonian tribe whose counting system comprised words only for 'one', 'two' and 'many'.

The researchers found that the tribe were exceptionally poor at performing numerical thinking with quantities greater than three. They argued this suggests language is a prerequisite for mathematical ability.

But does that mean that a mathematical genius should be better at language than the average person? There is some evidence for this. In 2007, researchers scanned the brains of 25 adult students while they were solving multiplication problems.

The study found that individuals with higher mathematical competence appeared to rely more strongly on language-mediated processes, associated with brain circuits in the parietal lobe.

However, recent findings have challenged this. One study looked at the brain scans of participants, including professional mathematicians, while they evaluated mathematical and non-mathematical statements.

They found that instead of the left hemisphere regions of the brain typically involved during language processing and verbal semantics, high-level mathematical reasoning was linked with activation of a bilateral network of brain circuits associated with processing numbers and space.

In fact, the brain activation in professional mathematicians in particular showed minimal use of language areas. The researchers argue their results support previous studies that have found that knowledge of numbers and space during early childhood can predict mathematical achievement.

For example, a recent study of 77 eight-to-10-year-old children demonstrates that visuo-spatial skills (the capacity to identify visual and spatial relationships among objects) have an important role in mathematical achievement.

As part of the study, they took part in a 'number line estimation task', in which they had to position a series of numbers at appropriate places on a line where only the start and end numbers of a scale (such as 0 and 10) were given.

The study also looked at the children’s overall mathematical ability, visuospatial skills, and visuomotor integration (for example, copying increasingly complex images using pencil and paper). It found that children’s scores on visuospatial skill and visuomotor integration strongly predicted how well they would do on number line estimation and mathematics.

Hidden structures and genes

An alternative definition of mathematical ability is that it represents the capacity to recognise and exploit hidden structures in data. This may account for an observed overlap between mathematical and musical ability. Similarly, it could also explain why training in chess can benefit children’s ability to solve mathematical problems.

Albert Einstein famously claimed that images, feelings and musical structures formed the basis of his reasoning rather than logical symbols or mathematical equations.

However, the extent to which mathematical ability relies on innate or environmental factors remains controversial. A recent large-scale twin and genome-wide analysis of 12-year-old children found that genetics could explain around half of the observed correlation between mathematical and reading ability.

Although this is quite substantial, it still means that the learning environment has an important role to play.

So what does all this tell us about geniuses like Ramanujan? If mathematical ability does stem from a core non-linguistic capacity to reason with spatial and numerical representation, this can help explain how a prodigious talent could blossom in the absence of training.

While language might still play a role, the nature of the numerical representations being manipulated could be crucial.

The fact that genetics seems to be involved also helps shed light on the case – Ramanujan could have simply inherited the ability. Nevertheless, we should not forget the important contribution of environment and education.

While Ramanujan’s raw talent was sufficient to attract attention to his remarkable ability, it was the later provision of more formal mathematical training in India and England that allowed him to reach his full potential.

459,Lack of love leads to to severe emotional and sensorial deprivation. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/can-lack-love-be-deadly,"I taught myself about orphanages 12 years ago, not actually because of my work as a human biologist but because of my daughter. She was born in 2004 and her first 14 months of life were spent in an orphanage in China.

I am well acquainted with the vast body of research that shows the physical and psychological harms of deprived environments. Orphanages can arguably be placed under this category along with other places such as refugee camps and some hospitals where children lack close contact and attention. Deprivation comes in many shapes and forms: lack of food, diseases, maltreatment, and child abuse are some of the harms that come to mind. However, I would argue that deprivation of love can be just as deadly.

When I started researching orphanages and child health I read the classic works of paediatrician Harry Bakwin, psychologist John Bowlby and psychiatrist Harry Edelston. At the beginning of the 20th century, in the US and the UK, the death rates among infants placed in orphanages, nurseries, and foundling hospitals were, in some cases, close to 100%. London’s Foundling Museum documents in depth these harsh realities. In the 1940s, the work of psychoanalyst Rene Spitz further documented high infant death rates (one out of three) and, among the babies who didn’t die, high percentages of cognitive, behavioural and psychological disfunction.

Most of these deaths were not due to starvation or disease, but to severe emotional and sensorial deprivation – in other words, a lack of love. These babies were fed and medically treated, but they were absolutely deprived of important stimulation, especially touch and affection.

The importance of touch

Human touch is fundamental for human development and survival. Research conducted by Ruth Feldman and Tiffany Field has shown the positive effects that come from skin-to-skin touch in premature babies and that these effects are still at work after ten years. Significant gains in neurological development, weight gain, and mental development of premature babies have been shown to be triggered by skin-to-skin stimulation.

Infants in orphanages can be deprived of touch, individual attention, and love. This happens not because all orphanages are terrible places (although some of them are), but because there are usually too many babies for the staff to manage. In the case of the hospitals, in Europe and the US in the first half of the 20th century, nurses were required to cover their faces with surgical masks and not interact with babies. Parents and other family members were prevented from visiting freely as it was believed this would prevent infections from spreading and help keep babies healthy. However, instead of getting better the babies got worse.

Bakwin understood that this was harmful to the children’s well-being. He stated that “failure of infants to thrive in institutions is due to emotional deprivation"". The term “failure to thrive” is currently used as an umbrella term of conditions, ranging from growth delay, emotional misery and death. It is a generalised health problem seen in high-income and low-income countries although it is more prevalent when poverty and a lack of human resources prevents the babies from receiving emotional and sensorial stimulation (or love) on a daily basis.

My daughter’s story

The reports from our adoption agency guaranteed that the children were well taken care of, fed appropriately, and had toys to play with. But how much sensory stimulation were they given? We knew that the babies were trained, from very early, to hold their feeding bottle on their own. It was not possible to have a carer per child during feeding times.

We flew to China and adoption day finally arrived. Our daughter seemed to be in good health. She adapted herself to us quickly, clearly enjoying the attention we provided, and ate everything we offered. However, on the day we held her for the first time, 90% of the baby girls her age were taller than her. The effects of short height at this age can linger for life and are usually associated with poor health in later life, such as a greater risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease.

Once we got her back home, we were certain that love and bonding would be what she needed most. Three months later, 75% of girls her age were taller than her. Today, at 11 years of age, only 50% of girls her age are taller than her. This is consistent with research that shows a catch-up growth for children who were in orphanages and internationally adopted.

When emotional deprivation and lack of love occur, physical growth slows down or stops. The body enters into a survival mode where vital, basic physiological functions are preserved at the cost of physical, mental, and social development. The longer the child is in survival mode, the more permanent and negative the effects will be. Once a child is adopted and the amount of love, care, and stimulation increases, the body ceases to be in survival mode and will start recuperating.

My husband and I study anthropometry, the study of human body measurements, providing accurate biomedical information on health and nutritional status. We measure our daughter twice a year and compare the results with the World Health Organisation references. But we do not obsess over her measurements. She is a very healthy child, doing well at school in academic subjects, sports, and music. We are now happily bracing for adolescence.

Our daughter’s experience mirrors that of thousands of other babies adopted into loving, well-off families. Increasing awareness on this issue is a step in the right direction, so that more orphaned children receive the happy ending my daughter did.

461,Could be bad for your health. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/why-you-shouldn-t-wrap-your-food-aluminum-foil-cooking-it,"If you’re baking fish, roasting vegetables or preparing a piece of meat for dinner tonight, chances are that you’ll wrap your food in aluminium foil. What you may not realise is that some of the foil will leach into your meal – and this could be bad for your health.

Research that I conducted with a group of colleagues has explored the use of aluminium for cooking and preparing food. Aluminium doesn’t just appear in foil: it is the most popular cookware material used by people in developing countries. Pots and pans are lined with it and it is found in some kitchen utensils like large serving spoons. Copper used to fulfil this role, but over time it’s been replaced by aluminium because it is cheaper to mass produce and easier to clean.

But while cooking your food in aluminium pots or pans isn’t a bad thing, placing it in foil and putting it in the oven is problematic. This is especially true with acidic or spicy food that’s prepared at high temperatures.

Aluminium and health

Human bodies can excrete small amounts of aluminium very efficiently. This means that minimal exposure to aluminium is not a problem: the World Health Organisation has established a safe daily intake of 40mg per kilogram of body weight per day. So for a person who weighs 60kg the allowable intake would be 2400 mg.",2016-05-21 21:30:00
462,Genes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/why-your-nose-looks-it-does,"Whether you’ve got a button nose, a hook nose, or a Roman nose, you can blame a specific group of five genes for the shape of your honker, according to a new study that appears in the journal Nature Communications.

When it comes to appearances, humans are probably the most diverse species on the planet, coming in all shapes and sizes. This goes as much for our faces as our bodies, and of course one of the most prominent items on the facial landscape is the schnoz.

Differences in nasal design are thought to be driven by a number of evolutionary adaptations, such as the need for nostrils of a particular size in order to control the volume and temperature of inhaled air. The fact that humans tend to recognize each other by sight rather than smell (in most cases!) is another key driver of our wildly varying facey bits.

Surprisingly, these enormous differences in nose shape and size are controlled by a rather small number of genes, which, according to the study authors, encode for specific characteristics such as nostril width, “pointiness,” and the inclination of the bridge of the nose.

To discover this, the researchers looked at photographs of 6,275 people from across Latin America, cross-referencing these images with a full analysis of their genomes, obtained via a DNA sample. In particular, the study authors analyzed 14 different facial traits, seeking out any genetic similarities between people with similar features.

Amazingly, the researchers were able to pinpoint five genes that seem to code for specific nasal traits. For instance, a gene called DCHS2 – which plays a role in controlling cartilage formation – was found to have a major influence over the pointiness of a person’s nose. Another gene, called PAX1, was identified as a driver of nostril breadth, while RUNX2, which is involved in bone growth, is vital for nose bridge width.

This knowledge could have major implications for the treatment of inherited facial deformations. Conditions such as Campomelic Dysplasia, for instance, are associated with a range of craniofacial defects, and are thought to be caused by mutations in genes controlling the development of cartilage.",2016-05-21 18:30:00

But according new research from Vanderbilt University, it's better to get real about gaps in your résumé—and being honest could actually land you the job.

""Our study provides the first-ever evidence that women who conceal personal information dramatically lower their hiring prospects,"" says Joni Hersch, professor of law and economics at Vanderbilt Law School, about women who take time away from their careers to raise kids. In other words, being forthright about stepping away from work in favor of family actually works—refreshingly—in women's favor.

I was shocked by the results,"" says Hersch.

Hersch and assistant professor Jennifer Bennet Shinall had 3,022 subjects act as potential employers and asked them to choose between two female job candidates. Each résumé had a 10-year gap in job history. A personal explanation—taking time off to have a child or a get through a divorce—was given for some of the candidates. No explanation was given on the other résumés.

The job-searchers who gave the personal info had a 30-to-40 percent increased chance of being hired, according to the findings.

""I was shocked by the results,"" says Hersch. ""The personal information gave no indication whether the woman would be a more or less productive employee. This was entirely neutral information. Yet the number of people who preferred the woman who explained her résumé gap was staggering.""

464,"When the bears switch to a leafy, less fibrous diet, they slough off the lining of their gastrointestinal tract ",http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/what-are-there-gooey-masses-panda-poop,"An analysis of giant panda poop has revealed that when the bears switch to a leafy, less fibrous diet, they slough off the lining of their gastrointestinal tract. It then passes through their digestive system and comes out as a gooey mass. The findings, published in Frontiers in Microbiology this month, may help explain why these endangered animals are struggling to reproduce.

Recent work revealed that the digestive systems of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) resemble that of carnivores and omnivorous bears – even though their transition to a vegetarian diet happened some 2 million years ago. Their gut and gut microbes are built for breaking down meat and small amounts of plant matter, yet pandas eat up to a third of their body weight in bamboo every day.

A team led by Garret Suen from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ashli Brown of Mississippi State studied two giant pandas living at the Memphis Zoological Society in Tennessee: a female named YaYa and a male named LeLe (pictured above). The team observed the pandas’ bamboo consumption behavior, and they collected fresh feces (pictured to the right) as well as samples of mucous excretion.

Pandas undergo dramatic seasonal shifts in diet: Most of the time, they eat bamboo stalks, but in August and September, they shift to leaves. Shortly after this summertime shift from woody stalks to less fibrous leaves, the pandas experience episodes of gastrointestinal tract distress, with symptoms ranging from abdominal pain to the excretion of mucous stools containing gelatinous pellets called mucoids. And the pandas stop eating.

After sequencing DNA extracted from stool samples, the team found that microbial diversity is lower in samples collected immediately before mucoid episodes than in the mucoids. Additionally, mucoids contain microbes that are typically found in the gut lining. Together, these findings suggest that mucoids are the expulsion of the internal mucus lining driven by changes in diet.

“What we think might be happening is that their diet is causing a strong internal reaction, leading to an inflammatory response,” Suen explained in a statement. “Pandas are basically shedding their gastrointestinal lining to allow for the replacement of those microbes. It’s kind of like resetting the microbiome.”

The researchers aren’t sure why pandas experience this resetting, and furthermore, this summer shift in food – and the sickness that follows – coincides with the beginning of panda pregnancies. Mucoids are more prevalent following breeding season, and the reduction in nutrition may affect gestation, lactation, and cub development.

465,Ecuador's Chimborazo is the tallest. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/everest-may-not-be-tallest-mountain-world-after-all,"Here’s an easy question for you: What’s the tallest mountain in the world? If you are wary of being asked such a seemingly simple query, you would be right to be concerned, because the answer is not necessarily Mount Everest.

At a height of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level, it puts other mountains on Earth to shame. However, if you measure this distance out from the center of Earth, thanks to elevated crust near the equator, Ecuador’s Chimborazo is by far the “tallest.”

Measured above sea level, it is only 6,268 meters (20,564 feet) high; when taken from Earth’s core, it is actually 2,168 meters (7,113 feet) higher than Everest would be by this metric. This means that although Everest may be the highest peak on Earth, Chimborazo may in fact be the most prominent – meaning that it “sticks out” more than anything else.

Then there’s the issue of Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on the island of Hawaii. At 4,207 meters (13,803 feet) above sea level, it doesn’t come close to either Everest of Chimborazo using this traditional metric. If the water around it is removed, however, then the height of this once angry mountain is actually around 9,330 meters (30,610 feet). Side by side, Mauna Kea trounces Everest.

The reason this old volcano is so high is because it is sitting on oceanic crust, which is denser than the continental crust that Everest has emerged out of. This means that, even with a massive chunk of rock sitting on top of it, the former cannot be compacted as much as the latter. Ultimately, oceanic crust can support the weight of higher mountains than the continental crust ever could.

In any case, this all pales in comparison to the depths of the deepest point in the ocean. The Challenger Deep, found south of the Japanese archipelago, is 10,984 meters (36,036 feet) below the surface of the ocean. At this depth, it is 2,136 meters (7,000 feet) deeper than Mount Everest is tall.

But why stop at looking at Earth’s features? Thanks to a now-extinguished stationary superheated mantle plume beneath the crust, the Olympus Mons shield volcano on Mars spent millennia piling lava flow after lava flow on top of itself. Nowadays, the extinct edifice is 21,229 meters (69,649 feet) high, which is roughly 2.4 times the height of Everest.

Speaking of volcanoes, Io – the most volcanically active object ever discovered – is currently orbiting Jupiter and spewing out some unbelievably high plumes of sulfurous material. Thanks to explosive volcanic activity at the surface, a nearly non-existent atmosphere providing almost zero resistance, and a low gravitational field strength, some of these plumes can reach heights of 500 kilometers (311 miles).

These gloriously gargantuan columns of volcanic material, some of which have been observed in real-time as they begin to freeze into frigid crystals in space, can fit around 57 Mount Everests inside them. To the Solar System, Everest is a mere molehill.",2016-05-20 06:30:00
466,It has a moon. ,https://secondnexus.com/technology-and-innovation/makemakes-moon/,"The dwarf planet Makemake, discovered in 2005, is cold, dark and remote. It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon.

Finding a Dark Moon

Until this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake’s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake’s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake’s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The “dark moon hypothesis” offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. “Imagine that the dark material isn’t on Makemake’s surface… it’s in orbit!” image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. “If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!”

Credit: Source.

Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake’s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden.

MK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don’t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker’s words, “not actually that faint”), but it was easy to miss before.

Part of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake’s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he

thought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, “Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?” When Buie replied, “There’s a moon in the Makemake data?” they knew they’d made a major discovery.

The Moon in the Data

It is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2’s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake’s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place.

However, MK2’s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake’s past atmosphere. If MK2’s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, “The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.” If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts.

The New, Improved Makemake System

While MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, ""The discovery of this moon has given us an

opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.""

Makemake is sometimes referred to as “Pluto’s little sister” because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. “That's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,” Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake.

Looking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system’s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech’s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, “The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. But we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story.” Small worlds like Makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more “exotic” ices and compounds. Since MK2 will allow scientists to tell Makemake’s density and thus the densities of the materials it’s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets.

The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. Even before then, though, information about Makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new Hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. “This new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system,” Buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us.",2016-05-20 01:54:06
467,New Orleans is sinking faster than previously thought. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/some-regions-new-orleans-found-be-sinking-five-centimeters-year,"It was already known the region is sinking, but now NASA has revealed it is happening at higher rate than previously thought. NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri

NASA has confirmed that New Orleans and the surrounding areas are sinking at a much higher rate than previously thought. Using airborne radar to map the rate at which the ground is sinking over a period of a few years, they were able to document in fine detail exactly which regions are most at risk, and where planning and building needs to be monitored.

The Earth’s surface can sink due to a mixture of natural and man-made causes. The weight of deposited sediment can, for example, cause subsidence, as can the movement of glaciers and the compaction of shallow sediments. But humans can also influence this process by pumping out oil and gas, or in the example of New Orleans, by the withdrawal of water.

The extraction of groundwater and dewatering of the region, in which surface water is removed in order to prevent standing water or saturated earth, is causing the city to sink. This has been exasperated by the building of levees, which prevent the natural build-up of sediment that counteract the sinking.

The region of Norco is one of the worst affected, sinking 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri

This is most acute in regions upriver along the Mississippi River, specifically the industrial areas of Norco and Michoud, where the ground is sinking by a worrying 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. Other areas of concern were in New Orleans Upper and Lower 9th Ward, where the subsidence may be related to the water levels of the Mississippi. Of particular concern is the changes in ground level around the levees built to prevent flooding, as they found regions behind the levees sinking by 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) a year.

The data used by NASA to build the maps, published in a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was created using NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), which is able to track changes in elevation on the Earth’s surface down to a centimeter difference. This by itself can’t tell the researchers what is causing the change in ground level, so they then have to disentangle all the possible causes, which operate at different time and space scales.

While the fact that the region is sinking is not new, NASA have highlighted that the degree to which it is happening is much greater than previously thought, and that it could be putting certain regions at a much greater risk of flooding, as if there wasn’t a big enough one to begin with. It is hoped that the data can be used to attempt to reduce or reverse the subsidence in the most severely affected areas, as well as help with planning decisions for the future.",2016-05-19 21:30:00

469,Atmospheric Mirrors caused by Solar Flares. ,http://www.iflscience.com/physics/scientists-finally-solve-50-year-old-mystery-atmospheric-echoes,"Scientists always love a thoroughly mysterious signal. Although one has never been traced back to alien life, terrific planet-wide thunderstorms on alien worlds far from our own have generated detectable radio bursts. Other such signals have been emitted from the heart of our own galaxy, perhaps due to the destruction of dark matter.

A new study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters has claimed to solve the enigma of another of these signals. The so-called “150-kilometer echoes” have been baffling scientists for half a century, but it turns out that every single person on the planet has been looking at the culprit their whole lives.

Every single day at dawn and dusk, the phenomenon rears its head: Radar signals, initially being sent into space by scientists, have been reflecting back towards the ground as echoes. Something at a height of 150 kilometers (90 miles) is acting as a mirror for these signals, and towards noon, the “depth” of the mirror extends downwards to a height of 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 19 miles).

The mirror then rises again towards sunset, where it disappears at night. Probes sent into the atmosphere during sunrise and sunset have failed to identify any potential source of the mirroring effect.

Researchers at Boston University decided to try and identify this mirror once and for all. “When you actually figure out something that nobody’s ever figured out before, that’s when it’s really worthwhile,” Meers Oppenheim, an astronomer at Boston University and joint co-author of the study, said in a statement.

The echoes, tracked throughout the day, at varying altitudes. Oppenheim and Dimant/Jorge Chau/GRL

They noted that the source of the echoes grew more powerful during solar flares and became considerably weaker during eclipses. The researchers also pointed out that the increasing depth of the signal during the day matched the angle of incoming solar radiation. This circumstantial evidence seemed to point to our local star as being potentially culpable, but the signal was unlikely to be coming from the Sun itself.

Ultraviolet light from the Sun is known to tear off the electrons of oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the upper atmosphere, which sends these electrons off at high speeds and with considerable energies. The interactions between these electrons, the electron-stripped molecules (ions) and other particles, are likely to cause the ions to vibrate in batches.

As the study suggests, this mass vibration could generate energetic waves that may be strong enough to reflect radar signals coming from the ground. Using computer simulations to replicate this mechanism, the researchers did indeed show that the energy from the incoming solar radiation is enough to ultimately produce radar-reflecting batches of vibrating ions.

As the Sun rises and moves across the sky during the day, the angle of incoming solar radiation increases, and the vibrating ion batches appear lower in the sky. Towards sunset, the angle decreases, and the “mirror” moves back upwards again. During energetic solar flares, more vibrating ions can be produced, and the mirror becomes more powerful.

Far from just solving a long-held mystery, the team note that this atmospheric mirror, which is easily located, can be used to track the complex movements of atmospheric currents and tides. In any case, this once-mysterious signal is definitely not coming from an alien civilization; perhaps more importantly, it’s not just coming from someone using their microwave at the wrong time of day.",2016-05-19 10:30:00
470,Not Yet. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/can-paedophilia-really-be-cured-drugs,"According to the Daily Mail, scientists in Sweden are working on a “cure” for paedophilia. The trial involves a drug that disrupts testosterone.

Forcing or persuading children to have sex is one of the worst things a person can do to them. Sexual abuse causes serious emotional and physical harm, and can ruin a child’s capacity to have healthy relationships as an adult. However, we mustn’t confuse all sexual abuse of children with paedophilia.

Paedophiles are sexually attracted to children but they may, or may not, act on their urges. In fact, my experience indicates that most of the people who abuse children are not paedophiles. Research by Alanko and colleagues, looking at the question of whether paedophilia was inherited, showed that approximately 5% of men in the study with paedophilia had offended against children. In fact, people who offend against children, in my experience, are (mostly) men who are obsessed with sex and are looking for a sexual outlet, regardless of the age of the victim.

In our research which looked at whether medication was helpful for sexual offenders who struggled with their obsession with sex, we found that while over 90% of them had committed offences against children, most of them had also abused adults. And, in some cases, victims included both males and females, showing a broad pattern of offending. These abusers will seek out any possible opportunity for sexual satisfaction and sadly children are often vulnerable and easy prey.

Clinicians use the following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria to diagnose paedophilia:

Over a period of at least six months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviours involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger). The person has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. The person is at least age 16 years and at least five years older than the child or children in Criterion A.

Most paedophiles don’t act on their urges

Many researchers think that paedophilia is a sexual orientation (like heterosexuality), rather than a psychosexual disorder or illness. Regardless of which it is, it’s very difficult for people to live with. Discovering at puberty that your sexual preference is for children, is usually a terrifying and depressing realisation.

Think back to when you were 13 or 14 years old and just beginning to become strangely drawn to the boys or girls around you. Now think what it would have been like if those feelings were not for your own peer group, but for much younger children. You might wonder or worry a bit at first, and, as time went on, worry a lot. Why are you so different? What is wrong with you? Who can you talk to about it?

It’s tough enough for teenagers to talk to their parents about sex, let alone tell them they are a paedophile. What we need to do, as a society, is to understand that some people are sexually attracted to children. More than this, we also need to understand that this attraction to children does not bring with it an uncontrollable urge to force sexual attention on children.

Or course, there will be a small number of people who either can’t or won’t control their sexual urges, but for the most part, they can and they will. Think of yourself in a similar situation with your preferred partner type. How easy do you find it to control yourself in a roomful of the type of people you are attracted to? It’s not so difficult to do, is it?

Medication to manage sexual arousal

But what about paedophiles who do act on their urges (as well as sex offenders who prey on children) – do the drugs work for them? As the researcher leading the evaluation of the use of these types of drugs in the UK prison service, I can reassure you that they do reduce people’s obsession with sex.

The drugs seem to work well and it is great that they are being offered (in this case) as a prevention tool. It’s also important that they are offered alongside psychological treatment to further help people control their urges.

As of April 1, 2016, both medication and psychological treatment are also being offered in the UK across the whole of the prison service, and some charities, such as the Safer Living Foundation, are also looking to offer them as a prevention tool for people who have not yet committed an offence.

Keeping children safe

Although testosterone disrupting drugs can help sex offenders control their urges, they may not be a cure for paedophilia. As already described, most people who offend against children are not paedophiles.

Most paedophiles are perfectly capable of controlling themselves and understand the damage that will be done to children by sexual abuse. We need to stop panicking about paedophiles, and focus our efforts on offering treatment and help to anyone struggling with their sexual urges. That’s what will help our children grow up safely.

471,Warmer sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/2016-likely-be-world-s-hottest-year-here-s-why,"We’re not even halfway through the year but already you may have heard talk of 2016 being the hottest on record. But how can scientists be so sure we’re going to beat the previous record, set just last year?

Even before the end of 2015, the UK Met Office was forecasting with 95% confidence that 2016 would beat the record. Since then, that confidence has grown still further, as record after record has tumbled. April 2016 broke the record for the hottest April after we had experienced the hottest February and March on record already this year.

NASA climatologist Gavin Schmidt recently estimated at least a 99% likelihood of 2016 being hotter than 2015.

The Role Of El Niño

The main reason why scientists are so sure that 2016 will be the hottest year is El Niño, which is associated with warmer sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The 2015-16 El Niño was among the strongest on record and has increased global average temperatures.

Even though the El Niño is now decaying, the second year of a major El Niño event is often associated with much warmer than normal conditions and is typically warmer than the first.

For instance, the 1997-98 El Niño was by some measures the strongest on record, and contributed to 1998 becoming the hottest year on record globally at the time.

Since the start of this year, we have seen global temperature records smashed time and time again. This means that much colder temperatures for the second half of the year would be needed for 2016 not to surpass the 2015 record.

Even a strong La Niña event (the cooler opposite of El Niño), which some analysts are forecasting, is unlikely to produce cold enough temperatures.

One thing that could prevent 2016 becoming a record-breaking hot year is a major volcanic eruption in the tropics. Volcanic eruptions at low latitudes can eject aerosols high into the atmosphere reducing the amount of energy from the sun reaching the Earth’s surface.

Previous eruptions such as Pinatubo in 1991 and Tambora in 1815 (which caused 1816 to be “the year without a summer”) reduced temperatures across much of the globe.

However, it is the year after the eruption that often experiences the most severe cooling, so an eruption would have to be pretty soon and very strong to scupper 2016’s chances of being the hottest year on record.

What About Climate Change?

The role of climate change is smaller because we’re comparing 2016 with last year (the previous record). Over such short periods of time, the contribution from global warming doesn’t change much.

However, scientists estimated that 2015 was about 1℃ hotter than it would have been without human-caused climate change. As the human influence on the climate has not increased greatly since last year this 1℃ estimate will also apply to 2016.

The highly likely record temperature of 2016 will join the previous 17 record-breaking hot years back to 1937 which were all made more likely due to human-caused climate change (the rising global temperatures were even noticed as far back as 1938).

So even if El Niño is driving the 2016 record, we can say that the temperatures of this year (and indeed the temperatures associated with all the records over the last few years) would be virtually impossible without climate change.

Climate change has been increasing the likelihood of global temperature records for many decades. The vertical red bars show the record-breaking hot years we can attribute to human-induced climate change. The shorter yellow bars show ranges of estimates for how much more likely a record hot year becomes each year. Andrew King, Author provided

An Omen For The Future?

We expect 2016 to beat the 2015 record for global average temperature as the decaying El Niño event pushes up surface temperatures.

This year, we’ve already seen devastating events associated with unusually warm temperatures, like the mass coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef, which has been largely attributed to human-induced climate change.

In future, we can expect to see more extreme heat events, like we’ve already seen in 2016, impacting society and ecosystems across the world.

And even though 2016 is likely to be the hottest year by some margin, we wouldn’t bet on this record lasting too long. While 2017 is very likely to be cooler due to a possible La Niña, with the strong warming trend the world’s experiencing it’s only a matter of time before we have another record-breaking hot year.

Only if we substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions now will we see the benefit of fewer record heat events in the future.

472,Unspecified jobs which can be done by machines. ,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/07/Not-Even-Hillary-Bernie-or-Donald-Can-Bring-Back-These-Jobs,"If you put water on the stove and heat it up, it will at first just get hotter and hotter. You may then conclude that heating water results only in hotter water. But at some point everything changes – the water starts to boil, turning from hot liquid into steam. Physicists call this a “phase transition.”

Automation, driven by technological progress, has been increasing inexorably for the past several decades. Two schools of economic thinking have for many years been engaged in a debate about the potential effects of automation on jobs, employment and human activity: will new technology spawn mass unemployment, as the robots take jobs away from humans? Or will the jobs robots take over release or unveil – or even create – demand for new human jobs?

The debate has flared up again recently because of technological achievements such as deep learning, which recently enabled a Google software program called AlphaGo to beat Go world champion Lee Sedol, a task considered even harder than beating the world’s chess champions.

Ultimately the question boils down to this: are today’s modern technological innovations like those of the past, which made obsolete the job of buggy maker, but created the job of automobile manufacturer? Or is there something about today that is markedly different?

Malcolm Gladwell’s 2006 book The Tipping Point highlighted what he called “that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.” Can we really be confident that we are not approaching a tipping point, a phase transition – that we are not mistaking the trend of technology both destroying and creating jobs for a law that it will always continue this way?

Old worries about new tech

This is not a new concern. Dating back at least as far as the Luddites of early 19th-century Britain, new technologies cause fear about the inevitable changes they bring.

It may seem easy to dismiss today’s concerns as unfounded in reality. But economists Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University and Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University argue, “What if machines are getting so smart, thanks to their microprocessor brains, that they no longer need unskilled labor to operate?” After all, they write:

Smart machines now collect our highway tolls, check us out at stores, take our blood pressure, massage our backs, give us directions, answer our phones, print our documents, transmit our messages, rock our babies, read our books, turn on our lights, shine our shoes, guard our homes, fly our planes, write our wills, teach our children, kill our enemies, and the list goes on.

Looking at the economic data

There is considerable evidence that this concern may be justified. Eric Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of MIT recently wrote:

For several decades after World War II the economic statistics we care most about all rose together here in America as if they were tightly coupled. GDP grew, and so did productivity — our ability to get more output from each worker. At the same time, we created millions of jobs, and many of these were the kinds of jobs that allowed the average American worker, who didn’t (and still doesn’t) have a college degree, to enjoy a high and rising standard of living. But … productivity growth and employment growth started to become decoupled from each other.

Lots more productivity; not much more earning. U.S. Department of Labor Statistics

As the decoupling data show, the U.S. economy has been performing quite poorly for the bottom 90 percent of Americans for the past 40 years. Technology is driving productivity improvements, which grow the economy. But the rising tide is not lifting all boats, and most people are not seeing any benefit from this growth. While the U.S. economy is still creating jobs, it is not creating enough of them. The labor force participation rate, which measures the active portion of the labor force, has been dropping since the late 1990s.

While manufacturing output is at an all-time high, manufacturing employment is today lower than it was in the later 1940s. Wages for private nonsupervisory employees have stagnated since the late 1960s, and the wages-to-GDP ratio has been declining since 1970. Long-term unemployment is trending upwards, and inequality has become a global discussion topic, following the publication of Thomas Piketty’s 2014 book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century.

A widening danger?

Most shockingly, economists Angus Deaton, winner of the 2015 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, and Anne Case found that mortality for white middle-age Americans has been increasing over the past 25 years, due to an epidemic of suicides and afflictions stemming from substance abuse.

Is automation, driven by progress in technology, in general, and artificial intelligence and robotics, in particular, the main cause for the economic decline of working Americans?

In economics, it is easier to agree on the data than to agree on causality. Many other factors can be in play, such as globalization, deregulation, decline of unions and the like. Yet, in a 2014 poll of leading academic economists conducted by the Chicago Initiative on Global Markets regarding the impact of technology on employment and earnings, 43 percent of those polled agreed with the statement that “information technology and automation are a central reason why median wages have been stagnant in the U.S. over the decade, despite rising productivity,” while only 28 percent disagreed. Similarly, a 2015 study by the International Monetary Fund concluded that technological progress is a major factor in the increase of inequality over the past decades.

The bottom line is that while automation is eliminating many jobs in the economy that were once done by people, there is no sign that the introduction of technologies in recent years is creating an equal number of well-paying jobs to compensate for those losses. A 2014 Oxford study found that the number of U.S. workers shifting into new industries has been strikingly small: in 2010, only 0.5 percent of the labor force was employed in industries that did not exist in 2000.

The discussion about humans, machines and work tends to be a discussion about some undetermined point in the far future. But it is time to face reality. The future is now.

473,Artificial Sweetener. ,http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/fda-warns-artificial-sweetener-can-be-fatal-dogs,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released an official warning to dog owners on the dangers of xylitol, an artificial sweetener used in many household products. While safe for humans, the ingredient can be fatal for their furry companion.

The toxicity of xylitol for dogs has been known for some time, but this is the first official advisory from the FDA. The warning comes amid an increase in the number of dogs accidentally poisoned by xylitol – a figure that has increased from 82 cases in 2004 to more than 3,700 in 2014.

Products that contain xylitol include sugar-free gum, certain baked goods, cough syrup, chocolate bars, children’s and adult chewable vitamins, mouthwash, and toothpaste.

If ingested by your pet pooch, the sweetener can cause their pancreas to rapidly release insulin, dropping their blood sugar to dangerously low levels – all within 10 to 60 minutes of consumption.

“In people, xylitol does not stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas. However, it’s different in canines: When dogs eat something containing xylitol, the xylitol is more quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, and may result in a potent release of insulin from the pancreas,” wrote the FDA in a statement. This results in hypoglycemia, a possibly life-threatening condition if not treated.

Depending on the amount consumed, side effects can take up to 12 to 24 hours to appear, so it is best to stay vigilant during this time. Symptoms to look for include vomiting, weakness, staggering, lack of coordination, collapse, and seizures. If your dog has consumed xylitol, take your pet to the nearest vet or emergency animal hospital.

Other items that dogs should not eat include grapes, raisins, alcohol, onion, garlic, macadamia nuts, avocados, and caffeine. As a side note, the FDA said they do not know whether xylitol is poisonous to cats, as they tend to show disdain for sweets.

The takeaway: There is nothing sweet about giving your dog artificial sweetener, so keep your gum and chocolate bars out of paws reach.",2016-05-18 16:00:00
474,It crushes the diamond. ,http://www.iflscience.com/physics/hydraulic-press-channel-takes-one-natures-hardest-materials,"The Hydraulic Press Channel has had a meteoric rise to fame over the past few months, simply by satisfying our appetite for mindless destruction and showing millions of people how amazing Finnish accents are. So far, it’s squished everything from bowling balls to non-Newtonian fluid . But now they must face nature's hardest substance: diamond.

The diamond was donated to the channel by a generous diamond retailer looking to jump on the viral bandwagon. As stated in the video, it’s a 1.2 carat jewel and worth at least $4,000, complete with its own certificate to prove it’s the real deal.

So, as Lauri Vuohensilta – the mad genius behind the channel – says in the video: “They say diamonds are forever, but how long?”

As it turns out, not very long.

So, how was the diamond broken so easily? As some have pointed out, the “hardness” that diamonds are known for only really refers to their ability to be scratch-resistant. While the covalent bonds between the diamond atoms themselves are extremely strong, diamonds can also be brittle, especially if there’s any kind of defect or it’s been poorly cut. Scientists have even discovered materials that are actually harder than diamonds, such as wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite.

Nevertheless, it’s still pretty impressive how swiftly the hydraulic press manages to shatter the diamond. That, and the ""bonus crushing"" of the plasticine model at the end is a particularly good one.",2016-05-18 14:33:26
475,"A few miles high, but not into space. ",http://mentalfloss.com/article/79672/how-high-can-runaway-helium-balloons-fly,"If there is no ceiling or other obstacle in their way, balloons ascend higher and higher until they are out of view, but how high can balloons actually fly? Helium-filled balloons can reach several miles above the Earth's surface, but they cannot float into space (if they could, that'd just mean more space junk we'd have to deal with).

According to Robert Matthews of Science Focus, toy balloons can ascend around six miles high, while weather balloons (which are made of more durable materials) can go three times that distance. This is thanks to the Archimedes Principle (explained here in this Carol Hodanbosi article for NASA). The balloon floats in the first place because its helium is less dense than the air outside. As a balloon climbs higher, the surrounding air pressure drops, and the helium inside expands. When the density of the balloon matches the density of the air, its ascension stops. And when the expanding helium becomes too much for the toy balloon's latex material, it bursts.

Please don't feel compelled to test this out, however. Not only do helium balloons mess with wildlife, they have also been known to cause problems for commercial planes. Sorry to burst your bubble.",2016-05-18 04:38:10
476,28-32. ,https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/the-right-age-to-get-married-126672874767.html,"Research shows a “sweet spot” for marriage — but should we believe it? (Photo: Stocksy/Studio Firma)

Go to college. Get your career established. Date around. Find out what you’re looking for in a life partner. Wait to get married.

That’s been the prevailing logic when it comes to minimizing your odds of divorce for some time now. But in a study released last month, University of Utah researcher Nicholas Wolfinger, PhD, asserts there is actually an optimal age range for lasting marriage — and you shouldn’t wait too long. He found that likelihood of divorce is lowest when you get hitched between the ages of 28 and 32.

Wolfinger, an adjunct professor of sociology at the university, had previously found a U-shaped relationship between age at marriage and likelihood of divorce by looking at data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) back in 2006 to 2010. The NSFG polled more 22,000 men and women aged 15 to 44 on topics ranging from factors determining marriage and divorce, to attitudes about sex and pregnancy.

Ever the good researcher, Wolfinger wanted to see if he could replicate those initial findings by pulling additional NSFG stats from 2011 to 2013. He got nearly identical information: Age 28 through 32 is the sweet spot for marriage — get married before or after that, and risk of splitting from a spouse increases.

“The odds of divorce decline as you age from your teenage years through your late twenties and early thirties,” Wolfinger writes. “Thereafter, the chances of divorce go up again as you move into your late thirties and early forties.” After age 32, divorce risk climbs about 5 percent each year.

But not so fast. Wolfinger’s findings are something to consider, sure — but they’re not a reason to freak out.

Related: The Best Times and Places to Have Major Relationship Conversations

There have been some naysayers of the findings, notably Phillip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. He has found a slightly older “perfect marriage” age range, using different data than Wolfinger. He found there’s, ultimately, no reason to worry if you get married later on. Cohen’s stats were from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, sent out to 295,000 American households per month to collect ongoing data on social, economic, and housing characteristics of individual communities.

Story continues

And here’s another very important thing to point out about Wolfinger’s study: It only looks at divorce during the first five years after marriage, says psychologist Karla Ivankovich, an adjunct professor at the University of Illinois at Springfield. Ideally, a marriage is going to last longer than half a decade. “So there is still possibility of divorce, just not in the time frame identified within the study,” she tells Yahoo Health.

In a way, that 28-to-32 demographic does make sense. By that age, you know a lot more about who you are, what you want out of life, and what you want in a life partner, than you did in your early 20s.

Interestingly, Marisa T. Cohen, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at St. Francis College and co-founder of the Self-Awareness and Bonding Lab, has polled the masses on this very subject: What’s the best age to get married? She found daters are pretty in sync with Wolfinger’s findings: After examining opinions from 773 people, “an overwhelming majority — 83.7 percent — felt that it is ideal to get married in between 25 to 34 years of age,” she tells Yahoo Health.

But even though getting married in this age range is something we say we want, that doesn’t mean this is the time all of us are universally ready for marriage, she caveats. “You need to be committed in order to make a marriage work. Some of the causes of divorce, besides infidelity, are lack of communication, being incompatible partners, and growing apart,” Cohen notes. “Basically, if you don’t know who you are as a person, you won’t be a good partner.”

Instead of focusing on age as the decider of when to get married, we should instead focus on social environments and life experiences — and growing out of that “emerging adulthood” phase, which generally rolls through our post-grad, mid-20s years — to determine when marriage is appropriate.

What we do know: Younger marriages are more likely to end, research shows — and the reason is the romantic landscape in a person’s early dating years. “We aren’t just seeing a change in the overall divorce rate and an increase in the divorce rate of those who marry young, but overall we are seeing a shift in the basic way in which people court one another,” Cohen explains. “What was once dating and courting, is now more of a ‘hookup’ culture in college. What was once getting to know you, your values and morals, is now right and left swipes.”

It takes time to get all those “options” out of your system, and settle on the person who is right for you. And it’s not just the romantic aspects of marriage, but also the practical ones, that come into consideration. It takes time to come to fully bear all the responsibilities Mom and Dad had been shouldering before — like car payments, rent, insurance, general life decisions — and all that takes place during this “emerging adulthood” period.

Now for the other side of that 28-to-32 group. If you choose to get married at an older age, you have been flying solo much longer, says Carin Goldstein, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in Santa Monica, California. “You’re pretty set in your ways,” she tells Yahoo Health. “You’re less willing to compromise or accommodate a partner’s opinion into your own. When you’ve been supporting yourself and making your own decisions for years, it’s harder to get used to the idea of someone else’s opinion.”

Now that we’ve looked at the logic behind the magical “28 to 32,” it’s time to examine why getting hitched before or after that age range is by no means a death sentence for your marriage. (Do relax.) In fact, that range won’t be right for everyone.

Ivankovich compares determining the ideal age a person should get married to spinning the mystery wheel at your favorite casino. “It is not so much a number, but dependent on an individual’s maturity, and ability to commit to a long-term relationship,” she explains. “Prior experiences with marriage — how [a person was] raised, psychosocial situations, religious factors, you name it — all impact readiness.”

Indeed, there are many factors that determine marital success, according to Liz Keneski, a PhD candidate in human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. She’s conducted work alongside Tim Loving, PhD, an associate professor in the School of Human Ecology at the university, examining the recipe for marital success.

One major predictor: how family and friends in the couple’s sphere of influence view the developing relationship. “People readily recognize norms for relationship development — or how relationships ‘should’ go, based on what’s typical for our society,” Keneski tells Yahoo Health.

For instance, according to Keneski and Loving’s work, couples’ friends and family members report liking a loved one’s partner more when they perceive the relationship is progressing normatively (a.k.a. nothing out of the ordinary, no apparent red flags). “They report doing things to show their support for the relationship more, too, like inviting the loved one’s partner over for an event, hugging the partner, or asking about the partner,” Keneski says.

Related: 5 Relationship Secrets From Couples Who’ve Been Together For 40+ Years

In other words, people really like when relationships follow the “typical” script — and just like friends and family, we probably like to see that regular progression in our own relationships, too. Keneski and Loving have found that dating milestones matter a great deal, checking boxes like first kiss, first intercourse, meeting one another’s friends and parents (and so forth), in a steady order. However, what seems to matter is the order of these events and how well they go — and not necessarily how fast they occur.

No matter your age, you have to be open to amending your timeline to marriage a bit. Everyone’s journey to the altar, should they want to reach it, is very personal. But here are some areas of focus couples must work on to make a marriage last at any age.

Early on: Smell the roses.

Early in your marriage — especially if you marry in or before that “sweet spot” — Ivankovich suggests taking some time for yourselves as a couple. Plan for the future, instead of rushing through it. Discuss family, instead of starting one. Travel the world, instead of settling in one place. In other words: Stop and smell the roses. “Life is just beginning, so take a moment to explore before settling down,” she explains. “Learn about careers, enjoy time together.” There will be lots of time to establish yourselves.

As you grow: Build strong relationships apart from your significant other.

Keneski says that, ironically, a strong pairing is not just about two people. “Working on your relationship with your partner is certainly paramount in creating a great foundation for a relationship,” says Keneski, “but don’t forget to foster strong relationships with friends and family outside of your relationship. What they think of your relationship and how they interact with you and your partner matters for the happiness of your relationship.”

As you add family: Flexibility goes a long way.

Ivankovich says that the more you are able to roll with the punches and make adjustments to your plan, the happier you will be — especially as you begin to factor kids and family into the equation. “Long-term plans involve love,” she says. “Take some time to create a map for the future and consider how this will impact a life that involves family — but be willing to adapt to whatever life throws your way.”

As you mature: Decide to stay married…

Marriage and family therapist Jodie Voth says she’s polled couples in the later stages of their relationships, asking them how they’d made it last. “I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again,” she tells Yahoo Health. “If ‘marriage forever’ is your goal, every successful couple past 40 years of marriage has told me the same thing: It is a decision to stay married. Not romance, not flexibility, not negotiation or communication skills — it is a decision. Sometimes, every day.” So, the next time you two get into an argument and cannot see eye-to-eye? Voth says you say, “I’m gonna stick this out, because I want to be married to this person for the rest of my life.” And then, you keep working on it.

… And don’t foster contempt.

While deciding to stay married is hardly romantic, Voth says studies from psychologist John Gottman reveal what can make the whole experience much happier — and more likely to remain intact, too. “His research tells us that allowing yourself to be influenced by your partner and refraining from contemptuous behavior are what make marriages last,” she explains. “So, yes, keep divorce off the table — but also be open to hearing your partner’s opinion, and stop rolling your eyes and using sarcasm to communicate.” Marriage is more pleasant if you work together constructively. Leave contempt at the door.

The available research shows that most workers in the U.S. already are working close to the point where problems can start to occur. Despite how pervasive the managerial idea still is that working employees harder always translates to a better bottom line, science says that your company isn't going to gain much, if anything, if you put in much more than an extra hour or two a day.

478,Not making your bed exposes dust mites to air/sunlight and kills them. ,http://www.domain.com.au/advice/why-you-should-never-make-your-bed-20151001-gjy8f6/,"People often tell you to make your bed because it ‘starts the day off well’ or that it brings order and calm.

But the lazy among us have always known making your bed is a bad idea.

For starters, it’s difficult to see the point of arranging all your throw pillows and stuffed animals on the bed if you’re only going to push them off hours later.

If you have to leave the house early in the morning you’re probably all bleary-eyed and you don’t have the time or desire for tackling chores.

Even if you thought about making your bed, as soon as someone nags you to do it, that immediately makes you not want to do it. It’s all very complicated.

Plus, it’s harder to get comfortable in your bed if it’s been made and the sheets are firmly tucked in. (I like to create a cocoon out of blankets and fold all the sheets up around my legs, to the point where it’s stupidly warm, which is why bed-making is not for me.)

Another thing to consider: if you make your bed in the morning, that means you’re telling yourself that you won’t be getting back into it for the rest of the day, and you just don’t need to place those boundaries on yourself.

Finally, all these very valid points have now also been backed up by scientific evidence. Thanks science.

According to reports, making your bed every morning may be bad for your health.

The reason is dust mites; they don’t just look nasty, they are nasty.

In the average bed there’s as many as 1.5 million microscopic mites crawling around and feasting off the skin cells you shed while you sleep.

In the morning, if you make your bed immediately, all of the skin cells, sweat, mites and their droppings – which can cause asthma and allergies – will be trapped underneath.

However, if the bed is left unmade, the mites, dead skin, the sweat, all of it, will be exposed to fresh air and light.

So, if you have to make your bed it is better to wait until the evening. By that point your bed is much less appealing to dust mites and they will have died from dehydration or just lost interest.

What you should do to mitigate allergies is wash your sheets every one-to-two weeks, use a damp mop or rag to remove dust and encase your mattress and pillows in dust-proof or allergen impermeable covers.

There you have it. You’re welcome.",2016-05-16 23:24:15
479,You can't react fast enough. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/watch-there-s-a-mathematical-reason-for-why-you-can-t-catch-a-dollar-bill-in-your-fingers,"Here's a life tip for you - if a stranger ever comes up to you in the street, telling you he'll give you a dollar bill for free, and all you have to do is catch it between your fingers when he drops it, get the hell out of there, it's a trap!

Seriously though, test it out with a friend, and unless you're an exceptional human being, you will never ever catch that dollar bill. But don't feel bad - there's a mathematical reason for why it can't be done, and it's rooted in the biological fact that the reaction time for most humans is about 0.2 seconds.

Yep, 0.2 seconds approximately how long it takes for you to see something, process it, and physically react to it, which is actually pretty impressive when you think about it. But that's not nearly quick enough for your eyes to see that falling dollar bill, and have your brain to process that information, and instruct your fingers to snap together in time to catch it.

So case closed, right? Well not quite, because you're perfectly capable of catching things on the fly - humans aren't completely useless - so why not some sweet, sweet cash?

As the Numberphile video above explains, it all comes down to some good old high school maths. We all know that when we drop an item from a height, you can figure out the time it will take to get to the ground based on the falling velocity and the distance travelled. Or you can figured out the distance travelled based on the falling velocity and time it takes to get to the ground.

You just need to use an equation like this, D = 1/2 gt2, where D = distance, t = time, g = gravititation acceleration, and gt = falling velocity. On Earth, gravitational acceleration is measured at 9.8 m/s2, but for the purposes of this calculation, Numberphile mathematician Tadashi Tokieda has rounded that value up to 10.

If all that is giving you maths homework nightmares, don't worry, the video above does all the work. Just sit back, relax, and feel smart by osmosis.

So when you use this equation to figure out a distance based on the human reaction time of 0.2 seconds and gravitational acceleration value of 10, you get 0.2 metres, or 20 cm.

If you measure a dollar bill, you'll find that it's around 15 cm long, which means that if someone is holding it at 5 cm or less above your fingers, it's pretty much impossible for you to react fast enough to catch it. Curse you, slow mortal brain!

But don't give up just yet, because there is hope if your one dream in life is to catch falling money between your fingers.

You'll have to watch the Numberphile video above to find out why even someone without above average reaction times could improve their chances of achieving this feat, but let's just say if you do agree to that stranger's bet in the street, make sure he lets you choose which fingers to use.

480,"Without a GPS, scent. ",http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/how-dogs-find-their-way-home-without-gps,"Animals’ ability to navigate long distances has long been shrouded in mystery. From the skill of racing pigeons to find their way home, to the seasonal breeding migration of the humpback whale, a huge range of creatures are capable of navigating in a consistent, precise and effective way.

Science has been slow to fully identify and understand the processes and cues involved in animal migration. However, evidence now suggests that a vast array of species, from beetles to birds to dogs, demonstrate amazing abilities to travel long distances, without the use of electronic GPS – something many humans have perhaps become over-reliant upon.

In April, the story of Pero, an adventurous four-year-old working sheepdog was reported. Pero managed to find his way from Cockermouth in Cumbria back to his previous home, near Aberystwyth, on the coast of mid Wales. In a real-life story reminiscent of “Lassie Come Home”, Pero somehow navigated about 240 miles in two weeks. Significantly, his microchip confirmed this was not a case of mistaken identity, this young sheepdog really had made it back to his first home.

Stories like that of Pero’s often attract media interest, leaving readers puzzled over how an animal can travel so far. Without speculating over whether the dog had been simply dropped off at the farm by someone who recognised him, these sorts of tales apparently prove the remarkable nature of animal instincts. The deep relationship between people and their dogs also seems to drive a desire to believe that there is something magical about this ability. So, is this navigation skill because of “personal bonds” between owner and dog, or is there a scientific understanding of the biology involved?

Sniffing out adventure. www.shutterstock.com/Kevin Lobene

A huge variety of animals use a number of different sensory systems in order to travel distances. Desert ants, for example, use environmental olfactory cues and odour plumes – clouds of scent dispersed by the wind moving odour molecules – to navigate their way both to food sources and back to their nests. Honeybees appear able to recall routes to feeding sites when exposed to scent from that location. Other species such as sea turtles, some amphibians, spiny lobsters and birds are able to use magnetic positional information to migrate or orientate towards specific target locations. This latter ability to exploit geomagnetic information is significant, as it is unlikely to be affected by weather conditions, cycles of light and dark, seasonality or global position in the same way that other cues might be affected.

In addition to a “magnetic compass”, birds also appear to use sun and star “compasses” for navigation. Parasitic nematode worms are capable of moving towards new hosts by responding to seismic vibrations and other species use vibrations for prey capture. Bats, birds and marine mammals can also identify location and travel with the help of sonar and infrasound, while visual landmarks appear critical for species such as ourselves.

Pero’s tale.

But just how did Pero find his way home? It is likely that many animals, including dogs, navigate using an integration of many of the internal systems and external signals mentioned above. Dogs are also very reward driven – so positive associations with particular places or people are likely to result in a desire to return. The intense olfactory ability of dogs is also likely to assist location awareness – my own dogs appear to “smell” the beach miles before we actually see it.

Interestingly, recent evidence that dogs and some primates possess a molecule associated with magnetoreception – the ability to sense a magnetic field – might further explain Pero’s return home. Cryptochrome 1 is a light-sensing molecule that regulates circadian rythmns in species as diverse as plants and fish. It seems that this molecule is present in the retinal cone cells of a range of other species too, including dogs, foxes, wolves, bears and badgers. It has also been identified in some primate species including the Bornean orangutan.

The reason for the presence of this molecule remains undetermined and researchers have acknowledged that it might not be related to magnetoreception. However, the identification of cryptochrome 1 in the photoreceptors of these mammals' eyes is identical to the location of the same molecule in birds. This might suggest that the ability to respond to magnetic positional information is maintained in birds and some mammals. Indeed, magnetoreception has been documented in different mammal species, leading to the suggestion that dogs might even defecate in response to the earth’s magnetic field.

It is interesting to note that researchers have as yet failed to identify this molecule in species such as bats, an animal already known to be capable of navigating using magnetic fields. Perhaps some species have evolved different ways to use magnetic fields to identify location, or, alternatively, a range of interacting biological processes may be involved.

It is important to remember however, that Pero and other animals reported as having travelled miraculous distances tend to be the exception rather than the rule. For every amazing story of a pet dog or cat travelling huge distances to return “home”, there are many more who are quite simply, lost. For those animals, even a deep bond with their human caregiver is not enough to drive or facilitate a long-distance return.

So while there does appear to be some fundamental biology that means even our domesticated species can navigate long distances, nailing down the exact science that enabled Pero’s exceptional feat of navigation remains tricky.

After removing the lure and plucking the snake from the cod's mouth, they released the fish back into the waters and it appeared to swim off. The snake might not look in the best of shape, but Warton told The Mirror that the snake was still alive.

482,"It has to do whether or not you think people, especially yourself, can change. ",http://time.com/4198374/psychology-past-romance/?xid=time_socialflow_facebook,"A friend once grumbled that, given the choice, she’d rather see her ex miserable than herself happy.

Few things in life are as traumatic as the end of a long-term, romantic relationship. Nonetheless, many people are able to eventually recover and move on relatively unscathed.

Others, like my friend, aren’t so lucky. Even years later, they remain mired in the pain of the experience. Any reminder of their former partner – whether it’s a casual mention in conversation or a Facebook photo – can elicit profound feelings of sadness, anger and resentment.

Why is it that some people continue to be haunted by the ghosts of their romantic pasts, struggling to let go of the pain of rejection?

In new research, my colleague Carol Dweck and I found that rejection actually makes some people redefine themselves—and their future romantic prospects.

In one study, we asked people to write about any lessons they’d taken away from a past romantic rejection. Analyzing their responses, we realized that a number of respondents thought the rejection unmasked a basic negative truth about themselves—one that would also sabotage their future relationships. Some said they’d realized that they were too “clingy.” Other thought they’d been “too sensitive” or “bad at communicating.”

Additional studies explored the consequences of believing that rejection had revealed a fundamental flaw. By linking rejection to some aspect of their core identity, people found it more difficult to move on from the experience. Some said they “put up walls” and became warier about new relationships. Others were afraid to disclose the rejection to a new partner, fearing that this person would change their opinion of them, thinking they had “baggage.” (This might explain why some people hide past rejections, treating them like a scar or stigma.)

We then wondered: what makes someone more likely to link a romantic rejection to some aspect of “who they really are”? After all, other respondents wrote that rejection was merely a part of life, that it was an important part of growing up and actually caused them to become better people.

It turns out that your beliefs about personality can play a big role in how you’ll respond to romantic rejection.

Past research has found that people hold divergent views about their personal characteristics, whether it’s their intelligence or shyness. Some people have a “fixed mindset,” believing that these qualities are unchangeable. In contrast, those who have a “growth mindset” believe that their personality is something that can evolve and develop throughout their lives.

These basic beliefs shape how people respond to failure. For example, when people believe that intelligence is fixed, they’ll feel worse about themselves – and are less likely to persist – after experiencing a setback.

We thought that beliefs about personality might determine whether people see rejection as a piece of evidence about who they really are – as a sign of whether they are a flawed and undesirable person.

In one study, we divided people into two groups: those who think personality is fixed, and those who think personality is malleable. Participants then read one of two stories. In one, we asked them to imagine being left, out of the blue, by a long-term partner. In the other, we asked them to imagine meeting someone at a party, feeling a spark and then later overhearing that person telling a friend that they would never be romantically interested in her or him.

We might expect that only a severe rejection from a serious relationship would have the power to make people question who they are. Instead, a pattern emerged. For people with a fixed view of personality, we found that even a rejection from a relative stranger could prompt them to wonder what this rejection unveiled about their core self. These people might worry that there was something so obviously undesirable about them that a person would reject them outright—without even getting to know them.

So what can we do to prevent people from linking rejection to the self in this negative way? One promising piece of evidence shows that changing someone’s beliefs about personality can shift his or her reaction to rejections.

In a final study, we created articles that described personality as something that can evolve throughout the course of a lifetime, rather than as something that’s predetermined. When we asked people with a fixed view of personality to read these articles, they became less likely to interpret rejections as an indication of a permanent, fatal deficiency.

By encouraging the belief that personality can change and develop over time, we may be able to help people exorcise the ghosts of their romantic pasts—and move on to satisfying relationships in the future.

As of Thursday, Emma Morano is the only person on Earth who was born in the 1800s. She credits her longevity to her very bizarre diet.

The 116-year-old Italian woman isn’t gluten-free, vegan, or Paleo. She’s not gulping green smoothies or snacking on superfoods. Morano told the Associated Press she eats two raw eggs a day. Yes, really.

Since developing anemia as a child, Morano has been on the raw egg kick. It was her doctor who suggested she should add the eggs to her diet when she was just a young girl.

“

Morano’s secret doesn’t mean we should all be slugging back egg yolks in the name of health. Even though instances of egg-related salmonella have reportedly decreased since 1998, eggs for human consumption are probably better off cooked, because hey — why risk it? Plus, one study found that egg protein is more digestible when cooked, yet another compelling reason we should fully cook our omelets.

Whether or not raw eggs are all they’re cracked up to be (had to), Morano’s old age isn’t out of the ordinary for Italy, w number of centenarians. In one village, there are roughly 300 people over 100 years old, NPR reported.

484,It's worm poop. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/these-mysterious-south-american-mounds-turn-out-be-giant-piles-of-worm-poop,"Scientists have long puzzled over what created strange mound formations in the tropical wetlands of South America, and a new study appears to have found the answer.

The mounds, which are called surales, are found throughout the Orinoco Llanos wetlands of Columbia and Venezuela, and according to research led by archaeologist and palaeoethnobotanist José Iriarte, these spectacular formations are actually massive conglomerations of worm poop.

Surales vary in size, with the largest mounds measuring up to 5 metres in diameter and up to 2 metres tall. To figure out how these gigantic lumps came to be, Iriarte, a researcher from the University of Exeter in the UK, and his team analysed the physical and chemical makeup of the mounds' soil.

The team found that up to one half of the total soil mass of the mounds is composed of earthworm casts – the muddy soil byproduct ejected from worm guts. It's not surprising that worms leave their casts behind – after all, everybody has to go sometimes – but how do their poop piles become so… comically epic?

According to the researchers, the surales form when large earthworms feed in shallow, flooded soils within the wetlands. These big guys leave their larger deposits behind, creating mini poop 'towers' that start sticking above the surface of the water. Kind of like when Saruman's tower becomes flooded in by the Ents… except with worm poop instead of an evil wizard.

After enough time, this casts tower begins to form into a mound, and the largest surales are formed when a couple of smaller mounds situated close enough fuse together.

Professor José Iriarte

Despite the surales' somewhat humble beginnings, now that we know how they come to be, it helps solve a riddle that has long perplexed researchers. Previous hypotheses on their formation included termite activity and a form of land erosion, but the new findings finally discount those explanations.

""This exciting discovery allows us to map and understand how these massive landscapes were formed,"" said Iriarte. ""The fact we know they were created by earthworms across the seasonally flooded savannahs of South America will certainly change how we think about human versus naturally-built landscapes in the region.""

The findings are reported in PLOS ONE.",2016-05-13 12:00:00
485,You get an oscillating circuit. ,https://www.wired.com/2016/05/go-ahead-connect-inductor-capacitor-see-happens/,"What happens when you put an inductor and a capacitor in a circuit? Something kind of cool---and actually important.

What is an inductor?

You can make all sorts of different types of inductors, but the most common type is cylindrical coil of wire---a solenoid.

When current runs through the first loop, it creates a magnetic field that passes through the other loops. Magnetic fields don't really do anything unless the the magnitude changes. A changing magnetic field will create an electric field in the other loops. The direction of this electric field will make a change in electric potential that acts like a battery.

In the end, we have a device that has a potential difference that is proportional to the time rate of change of the current (since the current makes the magnetic field). This can be written as:

There are two things to point out in this equation. First, the L is the inductance. It only depends on the geometry of the solenoid (or whatever shape you have) and its value is measured in Henry's. Second, there is the negative sign. This means the change in potential across the inductor opposes the change in current.

How does an inductor behave in a circuit? If you have a constant current, then there is no change (DC current) and thus no potential difference across the inductor---it acts like it's not even there. If there is a high frequency current (AC circuit) then there will be a large potential difference across the inductor.

What is a capacitor?

Again, there are lots of different configurations for a capacitor. The simplest shape uses two parallel conducting plates with electric charge on each plate (but a net charge of zero).

The electric charge on these plates creates an electric field inside the capacitor. Since there is an electric field, there must also be a change in electric potential across the plates. The value of this potential difference depends on the amount of charge. The potential difference across the capacitor can be written as:

Here C is the value of the capacitance in units of Farads---it also only depends on the physical configuration of the device.

If there is a current going into the capacitor, the value of the charge on the plates will change. If there is a constant (or low frequency) current, this current will continue to add charge to plates to increase the electric potential so that over time, this potential will eventually act like an open circuit with the capacitor voltage equal to the battery voltage (or power supply). If you have a high frequency current, the charge will be both added and taken away from the plates in the capacitor with no charge build up and the capacitor will act like it's not even there.

What happens when you connect a capacitor and an inductor?

Suppose we start with a charged capacitor and hook it up to an inductor (no resistance in the circuit because I am using perfect physics-wires). Think about the instant right when these two are connected. Suppose there is a switch, then I can draw the following diagrams.",2016-05-12 20:33:00

Unless you're an amphibian or a superhero (Fish Woman, anybody?), the answer will be ""No."" The brain's innate drive for oxygen would override any ""willpower"" to win the prize.

Unnervingly, if you're currently living on a steady diet of sugar-enhanced foods, your brain is similarly re-wired, demanding that next ""hit."" Your willpower has as much of a chance at resistance as the ability to keep your body underwater.

We know sugar is not a healthy substance -- but it was this stunning example by my colleague Dr. Mark Hyman about its impact on our brain that really drove home the message. You see, I'm a reformed sugar addict. During residency, a long ER shift was the cue for a few bags of Skittles. A studying session led to Swedish Fish. But I realized that these sugar hits always led to a crash -- and then a craving for even more -- which made it clear to me that it was time to make a change.

Your Brain on Sugar

Advertisement

Sugar acts within the brain's ""Reward Center"" mechanism (it's like the brain's equivalent of the elementary school Gold Star chart, or if you're like me and in a home with a toddler right now, the ""Potty Chart""). Upon eating sugar, your brain releases Dopamine, our favorite ""feel good"" hormone, the same one that's triggered by other pleasure mechanisms like sex, exercise, and, on the bad side of the spectrum, drugs like cocaine or meth.

Through the same mechanisms as drug addiction, frequent sugar intake means that the brain eventually gets accustomed to that high and become less sensitive to sugar. So to get the same rush, your brain requires more and more sugar over time.

Here's how it works: You eat a sugary food, your blood sugar levels spike, and your body releases Dopamine (yay!) and insulin (which triggers your body to store the sugar as fat). Then comes the ""crash"": your sugar level plummets and you feel tired, hungry, and reach for the next sugary treat. It's purely chemistry, my dear, and these physical urges completely override your willpower and desire to eat healthfully.

Break the Sugar Cycle

So are you doomed to be a victim to brain chemistry? Hardly. Just as excess sugar rewired your brain in the first place, cutting back can reverse the dependence, just as I did. But this is harder than it sounds, largely because:

(1) It's everywhere: Added sugar is included -- sometimes as the second or third ingredient -- in over 70% of packaged foods. Think everything from breakfast cereals to BBQ sauce to salad dressings and so-called ""healthy snacks"" like granola bars or even those ""heart approved"" refined-carb breakfast cereals. The FDA just acknowledged the confusion behind these labels this week and is looking at redefining them, but until then, it's fair game for sugar-ladened snacks to boast the ""healthy"" designation.

(2) It's sneaky: Sugar exists in many forms, making it easy for the food industry to hide it in ingredient lists, listed with other names in foods you might not even think of as ""sugary.""

The Let's-Be-Realistic Bottom Line

Look, we all know the white stuff is going to sneak in somewhere, sometime, into our own and our kids' diets. You don't need to become a biochemist to cut back, and you can still even have a sugary treat once in a while. But if you're tired of this sugary chemistry experiment going on in your brain, follow these 3 steps to at least minimize the majority of added sugar.

Learn its disguises:

As tricky as this seems, sugar is almost never called just ""sugar"" on ingredient lists, so you have to be smart about spotting where it hides.

There are at least 61 different names for sugar on food labels. I may be a science nerd at times, but even I don't expect you to memorize them. Here are a few tricks: avoid anything ending in ""-ose"" like sucrose or maltrose. Look out for the buzzwords of ""syrup,"" ""nectar,"" ""cane"" and ""sweetener."" And be mindful that even natural sugars, like agave or honey, still contribute to your daily sugar limit. If sugar (or any of these terms) is in the top 5 ingredients, it's a treat, and not a nutritious food.

Cut Out Liquid Sugar:

Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages? News flash -- your brain doesn't even recognize these calories as food, leading to a high and crash that will end with you eating even more. Public enemy #1 is soda -- with up to 46 grams in a single 12-oz can, one drinks can put you over the sugar limit for the entire day (24 grams per day for women and 36 for men, per the AHA). Multiple studies have suggested the link between increased soda consumption and obesity in the U.S.

Advertisement

But it's not just soda -- watch the ""healthy juice"" too: many juices and seemingly healthy drinks contain added sugar. For the most part, unless you're talking a fresh-pressed, unsweetened juice, you're better off eating a whole piece of fruit. And to settle the whole fruit-is-sugar debate, while fruit does have sugar in the form of fructose, it's nothing in comparison to added sugars and doesn't cause the same blood-spiking mechanisms. There's no need to limit fruit if you're focusing on cutting back added sugar.

DIY It:

You don't have to completely cut out everything sweet; I don't like my coffee black or my yogurt plain. But it's a lot easier to control the amount of sugar you're adding if you do it yourself. Add a half-packet to coffee instead of letting the barista talk you into a fancy sweetened frappe. Buy plain Greek yogurt and add berries and honey; I guarantee it will have less sugar than the fruit-flavored, sugar-laden packaged kind. As it often does, it comes down to a simple truth: it's a lot easier to know what's going on in your body if you control what you put into it.

487,"It may reduce your capacity for empathy but pain may also reduce that as well.
",http://elitedaily.com/wellness/tylenol-side-effects-empathy/1491466/,"Zapping your headache by popping a few pills may also be killing your ability to feel.

In a new study published by The Ohio State University in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, researchers reveal, acetaminophen may reduce the ability to feel empathy for others.

Acetaminophen also happens to be the main ingredient in Tylenol.

To come to its conclusion, the team devised two double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments.

As the team describes,

...participants rated perceived pain, personal distress, and empathic concern in response to reading physical or social pain scenarios, witnessing ostracism in the lab, or visualizing another study participant receiving painful noise blasts.

The study came to its findings after having 40 college-aged participants take 1,000 mg of acetaminophen, while 40 more participants took a placebo.

The group then read eight different and unpleasant scenarios. In the end, the group that took the acetaminophen rated the scenarios as ""less severe"" than their placebo counterparts.

The team tested the results with a second set of 114 college students and came to similar findings.

How can this really translate into your everyday life?

Baldwin Way, senior author of the study, told Science Daily,

If you are having an argument with your spouse and you just took acetaminophen, this research suggests you might be less understanding of what you did to hurt your spouse's feelings.

The pure volume of acetaminophen taken in the US can also have profound effects on society as well. As the team concluded in its abstract,

Because empathy regulates prosocial and antisocial behavior, these drug-induced reductions in empathy raise concerns about the broader social side effects of acetaminophen, which is taken by almost a quarter of US adults each week.

However, simply not taking pain medication is a real lose-lose situation. Dominik Mischkowski, co-author of the study, pointed out to USA Today,

488,Liver disease. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-discovered-what-could-be-a-significant-new-health-risk-from-travelling-in-space,"If humanity is ever going to realise its ambitions of travelling to Mars and elsewhere in the Solar System, one of the challenges we're going to have to address is how to stay healthy in space over long periods of time. NASA estimates it's going to take at least 150 days for humans to get to Mars, and that's a long time to be exposed to things like cosmic radiation without the benefits of Earth's protective magnetic field.

Unfortunately, some of the latest research on the effects of spending time in space doesn't have very positive findings. A recent study found that mice flown aboard the space shuttle Atlantis returned to Earth with the early signs of liver disease – and the animals were only off the planet for less than a fortnight.

After 13.5 days onboard the shuttle during its final flight in 2011, the mice were studied by a team of scientists including anaesthesiologist and physicist Karen Jonscher from the University of Colorado. The team found that even a short duration of spaceflight appeared to activate specialised liver cells that can induce scarring and cause long-term liver damage.

""Prior to this study we really didn't have much information on the impact of spaceflight on the liver,"" said Jonscher. ""We knew that astronauts often returned with diabetes-like symptoms, but they usually resolved quickly.""

Unlike other studies that have analysed the effects of cosmic radiation on mouse brains to see how exposure to space could impact the animals' cognitive abilities, the researchers don't think radiation is what caused the liver damage in this case.

The more likely culprit is the relative lack of gravity in a microgravity environment, which scientists think has a negative influence on the animals' metabolisms.

""We saw the beginning of nascent liver damage in just 13.5 days,"" said Jonscher. ""The mice also lost lean muscle mass. We have seen this same phenomenon in humans on bedrest – muscles atrophy and proteins break down into amino acids. The question is, how does that affect your liver?""

When the space-faring mice were compared with a control group that stayed on Earth, samples taken from the travellers indicated increased fat storage in their livers, along with lower levels of retinol – an animal form of Vitamin A – and changes to the levels of genes that help break down fats.

Taken together, these are all signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and potential early indicators of fibrosis. The most disturbing aspect of the findings, which are reported in PLOS ONE, is the rapid timeframe in which these symptoms developed in the animals.

""It generally takes a long time, months to years, to induce fibrosis in mice, even when eating an unhealthy diet,"" said Jonscher. ""If a mouse is showing nascent signs of fibrosis without a change in diet after 13.5 days, what is happening to the humans?""

While NASA is aware of some of the risks that altered gravity fields can have on the human body – listing it first on a rundown of factors that could impact our health in space – liver damage isn't one of the risks reported, indicating we may still have a lot to learn in this area.

Of course, one of the primary scientific goals of NASA astronaut Scott Kelly's famous 'year in space' was the unique opportunity to see what such a long-haul trip off the planet did to the human body – with Kelly's twin brother, former astronaut Mark Kelly, serving as an Earth-based control.

The most remarkable and immediate (and temporary) effect seen was Scott Kelly growing an astonishing 5 centimetres (2 inches) taller over the course of the year, due to the reduced gravity environment onboard the International Space Station – but NASA's ongoing research into the pair and their health will be long-lasting.

In the meantime, scientists will need to do a lot more research to gauge the potential of liver damage from space travel, both in mice and humans. And aside from any technological measures we can implement to try to reduce or mitigate the health risks of space, the researchers also acknowledge the situation might not be quite as stark as these early results suggest.

""Whether or not this is a problem is an open question,"" said Jonscher. ""We need to look at mice involved in longer duration space flight to see if there are compensatory mechanisms that come into play that might protect them from serious damage.""",2016-05-12 16:30:01
489,Can I trust this person? Can I respect this person? ,http://www.businessinsider.com.au/harvard-psychologist-amy-cuddy-how-people-judge-you-2016-1,"Harvard social psychologist Amy Cuddy. Craig Barritt/Getty

People size you up in seconds, but what exactly are they evaluating?

Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy has been studying first impressions alongside fellow psychologists Susan Fiske and Peter Glick for more than 15 years, and has discovered patterns in these interactions.

In her new book “Presence,” Cuddy says people quickly answer two questions when they first meet you:

Can I trust this person?

Can I respect this person?

Psychologists refer to these dimensions as warmth and competence respectively, and ideally you want to be perceived as having both.

Interestingly, Cuddy says that most people, especially in a professional context, believe that competence is the more important factor. After all, they want to prove that they are smart and talented enough to handle your business.

But in fact warmth, or trustworthiness, is the most important factor in how people evaluate you. “From an evolutionary perspective,” Cuddy says, “it is more crucial to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.” It makes sense when you consider that in cavemen days it was more important to figure out if your fellow man was going to murder you and steal all your possessions than if he was competent enough to build a good fire.

Cuddy’s new book explores how to feel more confident. Amazon

While competence is highly valued, Cuddy says it is evaluated only after trust is established. And focusing too much on displaying your strength can backfire.

Cuddy says MBA interns are often so concerned about coming across as smart and competent that it can lead them to skip social events, not ask for help, and generally come off as unapproachable. These overachievers are in for a rude awakening when they don’t get the job offer because nobody got to know and trust them as people.

“If someone you’re trying to influence doesn’t trust you, you’re not going to get very far; in fact, you might even elicit suspicion because you come across as manipulative,” Cuddy says. “A warm, trustworthy person who is also strong elicits admiration, but only after you’ve established trust does your strength become a gift rather than a threat.”

490,"Sleep to ""Prune"" unused or ineffective synapses. ",http://www.fastcompany.com/3059634/your-most-productive-self/your-brain-has-a-delete-button-heres-how-to-use-it,"There’s an old saying in neuroscience: neurons that fire together wire together. This means the more you run a neuro-circuit in your brain, the stronger that circuit becomes. This is why, to quote another old saw, practice makes perfect. The more you practice piano, or speaking a language, or juggling, the stronger those circuits get.

The ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. For years this has been the focus for learning new things. But as it turns out, the ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. Even more important is our ability to break down the old ones. It’s called “synaptic pruning.” Here’s how it works. Your Brain’s Delete Button And How to Use It Your Brain Is Like A Garden Imagine your brain is a garden, except instead of growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables, you grow synaptic connections between neurons. These are the connections that neurotransmitters like dopamine, seratonin, and others travel across. “Glial cells” are the gardeners of your brain–they act to speed up signals between certain neurons. But other glial cells are the waste removers, pulling up weeds, killing pests, raking up dead leaves. Your brain’s pruning gardeners are called “microglial cells.” They prune your synaptic connections. The question is, how do they know which ones to prune?

advertisement

advertisement

Researchers are just starting to unravel this mystery, but what they do know is the synaptic connections that get used less get marked by a protein, C1q (as well as others). When the microglial cells detect that mark, they bond to the protein and destroy–or prune–the synapse. This is how your brain makes the physical space for you to build new and stronger connections so you can learn more. Why Sleep Matters Have you ever felt like your brain is full? Maybe when starting a new job, or deep in a project. You’re not sleeping enough, even though you’re constantly taking in new information. Well, in a way, your brain actually is full.

advertisement

When you learn lots of new things, your brain builds connections, but they’re inefficient, ad hoc connections. Your brain needs to prune a lot of those connections away and build more streamlined, efficient pathways. It does that when we sleep. Your brain cleans itself out when you sleep–your brain cells shrinking by up to 60% to create space for your glial gardeners to come in take away the waste and prune the synapses. Have you ever woken up from a good night’s rest and been able to think clearly and quickly? That’s because all the pruning and pathway-efficiency that took place overnight has left you with lots of room to take in and synthesize new information–in other words, to learn.

advertisement

Thinking with a sleep-deprived brain is like hacking your way through a dense jungle with a machete. Its overgrown, slow going, exhausting. This is the same reason naps are so beneficial to your cognitive abilities. A 10- or 20-minute nap gives your microglial gardeners the chance to come in, clear away some unused connections, and leave space to grow new ones. Thinking with a sleep-deprived brain is like hacking your way through a dense jungle with a machete. It’s overgrown, slow-going, exhausting. The paths overlap, and light can’t get through. Thinking on a well-rested brain is like wandering happily through Central Park; the paths are clear and connect to one another at distinct spots, the trees are in place, you can see far ahead of you. It’s invigorating. Be Mindful Of What You’re Mindful Of And in fact, you actually have some control over what your brain decides to delete while you sleep. It’s the synaptic connections you don’t use that get marked for recycling. The ones you do use are the ones that get watered and oxygenated. So be mindful of what you’re thinking about.

491,"The discovery of 1,284 confirmed exoplanets. ",https://bit.ly/1T9twP8,"As NASA readied to announce new information about the organization’s planet-hunting division, many of us wondered if we were going to hear the words, “We are not alone in this universe.” We did not. During a live audio conference, Kepler mission researchers announced the discovery of 1,284 confirmed exoplanets as part of a recent study—the most every announced at one time.

Since the Kepler Space telescope launched back in 2009, it’s mission has been to seek out possible habitable planets. If we are to become a space-faring species, we have to find Earth-like planets beyond our own solar system. Since its launch, Kepler has been watching 150,000 stars to find these possible habitable planets.

This star chart illustrates the patch of sky Kepler has been staring at for the past few years. It’s field of view occupies 100 square degrees of our galaxy.

The work of these scientists uses “astrophysical false positive probability calculations for every Kepler Object of Interest.” The 1,284 planets that have been validated as exoplanets through this method and no other. They determine, using these calculations, 1 percent of the 1,284 verified planets will be false-positives.

“Planet candidates can be thought of like bread crumbs,” said Timothy Morton, associate research scholar at Princeton University in New Jersey. “If you drop a few large crumbs on the floor, you can pick them up one by one. But, if you spill a whole bag of tiny crumbs, you’re going to need a broom. This statistical analysis is our broom.”

This method may help unlock Kepler’s full potential, cutting down the busy-work of examining anomalies that may not even be planets.

Kepler’s mission is to detect planets in that Goldilocks Zone. It examines the transit of planets across distant stars, which gives researchers an idea of the candidates ability to how life based on its orbit and size. While there’s so much more information to judge the “habitablility” of a planet, this is what Kepler is able to measure.

Future telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will be able to give researcher more information about distant planets. It will allow researchers to assess whether a planet is habitable or not based on atmospheric composition.

It’s nice to think that mapping out our galaxy may help us build a road map for future space-faring generations.

Stephen Petranek, a journalist and author of a new book titled How We’ll Live on Mars, agrees. He says we must become a space-faring society. Mars is the first step, a step that won’t be without its challenges, but a necessary one that will better prepare us.

492,The part of the brain associated with inhibition quiets down. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/something-weird-happens-to-your-brain-when-you-start-improvising,"The best musicians are somehow able to come up with a song or piece of music on the fly that no one has ever heard before. They just let the music flow, riffing off something that exists and creating something new.

That's what we call creative genius. But where does this improvisational ability come from? Charles Limb, a music-obsessed otolaryngologist and surgeon, wanted to know exactly that.

Over the past few years, he's put jazz musicans and rappers into MRI machines to see what's happening in their brain as they freestyle and improvise.

Results showed that when someone is creating something new, parts of the brain associated with self-expression (language and at times, especially while freestyle rapping, parts associated with visual imagery) are highly active.

At the same time, and perhaps more interestingly, another part of the brain associated with inhibition quiets down. At a TEDx talk in 2010, he said it looks like it does this ""so that you're not inhibited, so that you're willing to make mistakes, so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses"".

Below is a graphic from Limb's studies that shows that while improvising, areas of the brain involved in self-monitoring – the sort of thing that might stop creativity – quiet down (those are blue); while areas of the brain connected to expression and language become very active (in red).

TED

It's important to be cautious about research like this, as Limb notes, because we're just scratching the surface here. We know very little about how the brain works. Plus, images of what's happening in the brain – as fascinating as they are – are still a sort of observational science. We see something that's happening but don't know what's driving it and certainly can't manipulate it yet, flipping a creative switch.

But this is a start to understanding what creativity looks like.

To first look at what was happening as a jazz musician came up with something new, Limb had six musicians go through a set of steps. First he had them play scales, then improvise on them. Then they played a memoriSed piece of music, and finally an improvised version of that – all while inside an MRI scanner.

But they were up to the challenge. And all showed similar results while improvising – a dampening of parts of the brain associated with inhibition and an increase in activity associated with self expression.

Here's another graphic showing the way that brain activity changed. Blue is a decrease in activity, red is an increase:

TED

When Limb first published his research on the topic, co-author Allen Braun noted the similarities between the brains of improvisers and the brains of people in REM sleep – while they were dreaming.

""It's tantalising to think some connection exists between improvisation and dreaming, which are both spontaneous events. These musicians may in fact be in a waking dream,"" Braun told Hopkins Medicine.

Limb has followed this up with other research since then. He's shown that while improvising with partners, musicians' language centres in the brain are highly active, lending support to the idea that their music may actually be understood by the brain as a 'language' on its own.

More than anything else, it's fascinating to start to look at what creativity is on a neurological level. After all, the brain is perhaps the greatest unexplored frontier in understanding how people work.

We've mapped the human genome but are still trying to understand the massive network of neurons and glial cells beneath our skull. Concepts like creativity – the ability to make a mental leap and come up with something new – are even more mysterious.

""We know very little about how we are able to be creative,"" Limb says in the TED talk. But as he told Hopkins Medicine before, creativity is a fundamental part of humanity.

""Without this type of creativity, humans wouldn't have advanced as a species,"" says Limb. ""It's an integral part of who we are.""

“There is such a romance to me for the Los Angeles Rams to be sitting here playing the NFC Championship Game in that new stadium, and then to turn around and potentially play in the Super Bowl there,” said Jones on 105.3 The Fan, via Audacy. “They’re about one mile from the little house my parents lived in when I was born – I was born right there. I have a lot of relatives out there.

“There is so much of me that would like to see that fairytale here. This is the first real big year for them to be operating in that stadium. We have our media headquarters out there. That just looks like the Hollywood sign that used to be on that mountain. That was the city of entertainment for the world. Now, we see that beautiful stadium, and I’m excited about that. So I’m rooting for them.”

The Rams are coming into this weekend with a lot of confidence. Last Sunday, they knocked off the Buccaneers on the road.

Josh Allen set the tone for the Bills this past Sunday well before Buffalo’s offense took its first snap against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium.

In the morning leading up to the Week 16 AFC East showdown, Allen informed teammates that he woke up with “violence” on his mind. The star quarterback’s outlook, as wideout Isaiah McKenzie explained to NBC Sports’ Peter King after the game, resonated with the Bills.

“His point in saying he woke up with violence on his mind was we gotta come out and play every play like it’s the most important play,” McKenzie told King. “And we felt that from the first play of the game.”

Allen looked like a man possessed in Foxboro. The fourth-year pro had his way with New England’s defense, throwing for 314 yards with three touchdowns while also pacing Buffalo in rushing yards with 64. Allen’s stellar performance helped the Bills secure a 33-21 win, which vaulted Buffalo back into first place in the AFC East.

McKenzie certainly took Allen’s message to heart. The speedy slot wideout put together the game of his life, racking up 11 catches for 125 yards with a touchdown. McKenzie’s breakout game couldn’t have come at a better time for the Bills, who were without top WRs Cole Beasley and Gabriel Davis.

Players and coaches fall under the Tier 1 category, the NFL.com story noted, but the NFL Players’ Association would need to sign off on the NFL’s plan before players would get the booster shot.

But one player seems eager to get the booster shot: Chiefs wide receiver Josh Gordon.

Gordon, who was among the 36 NFL players to go on the NFL’s reserve/COVID-19 list, tweeted about the move.

One of the longest and most toxic rivalries in the NFL reignites for 2021 when the former takes their talents to FedEx Field on Sunday, and amid a fiery public exchange of words between the team's head coaches. Mike McCarthy expressed the ultimate ""confidence"" in his gameplan to go into Maryland and win, his comments meeting the ire of Ron Rivera, who labeled them a ""big mistake.""

That was far from the end of their exchange though, the media serving as a messenger service between Dallas and Greater Landover this week. On Friday, McCarthy was asked about Rivera's distaste for his initial comment, and he didn't pull any punches.

""The conversation we had in [Thursday's press conference], we were talking about a number of different things,"" said McCarthy. ""I think when you come out of a bye weekend, just like comments that are made, context is important. And I think sometimes that gets lost. But it's irrelevant what anybody thinks, anybody thinks about what I said in here yesterday. I was talking about my team.

""I can always coach my own team. And that's where I'm at with it.""

The temperature between the two rivals spiked further when owner Jerry Jones tagged in and jumped off of the top rope.

""We have always sold more Cowboys hats, caps, T-shirts, we've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington,"" Jones told 105.3FM the Fan. ""That's outside the Dallas area -- outside the Texas area -- Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count.""

Despite there being a large element of fact in what Jones said, it sparked an even taller storm surge during what's labeled as ""Dallas week"" in the nation's capital, but it's what Jones did two days later that's truly turning the screws. The Hall of Fame owner flew in the Cowboys benches to have them placed on Dallas' sideline on Sunday, a first time for any opponent entering FedEx Field.

Let the games begin.

Now, it's entirely possible this wasn't merely intended to be a slight from Jones to a franchise that, if they had their way, wouldn't have allowed the Cowboys into the NFL in the first place (back in the late 1950s). Apparently, the Seattle Seahawks (who lost to Washington at FedEx Field in Week 12) tipped off Jones to issues with the hotseat benches on the visitor's sideline in the stadium, per Todd Archer of ESPN, detailing how they'd routinely go out during the game, so Jones decided to ship his own to prevent that from being an issue.

Temperatures are expected to be in the mid-40s at kickoff, per Weather.com, so Jones made the call.

The Cowboys are 8-4 after stumbling mightily in November and then handing the New Orleans Saints a loss at Caesars Superdome to begin the all-important month of December, but Rivera has Washington on a red-hot four-game win streak that puts them at 6-6 and back in the playoff hunt. Their battle on Sunday will be the first of the season and is not only critical for both clubs, but will also set the tone for their second matchup to come in two weeks from today. Rivera is hoping to upset the Cowboys and not only send a message to the NFL that his team could make waves going forward, but also as a means of shoving McCarthy's and Jones' foot into their respective mouths.

Of course, the latter two want nothing more than to do the same to Rivera, who has also reportedly held a meeting to advise his players to not fall for any perceived psychological tactics being deployed this week by the Cowboys, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network. It could be argued that Rivera having that conversation means they've already allowed the Cowboys into their mental space, but ultimately it'll come down to what happens on the field that decides this game, and the NFC East.

To that point, the Cowboys are seeing a surge of reinforcements return in Week 14 while Washington is forced to be without a slew of key players due to a combination of injury and COVID-19. If Rivera is going to stun Dallas, he's going to have to hope they're not on their best game -- i.e., overconfident -- and that his squad steps up to show McCarthy and Jones why words and flown-in benches don't matter.

If you're not familiar with Scorigami, it's pretty simple: The internet cheers when the NFL gives us a final score that's never been seen before and that's what the Colts' 41-15 upset win over the Bills gave us during Week 11.

Scorigami has grown so much on Twitter that the Colts even made note of the fact that they hit the unique score in the win.

The idea of tracking every Scorigami was created by SB Nation writer Jon Bois and there's now a Twitter account with more than 275,000 followers that tracks each and every Scorigami.

The Scorigami Twitter account should probably dedicate this week's Scorigami to Jonathan Taylor and that's because he scored five touchdowns in the win.

The Colts victory marked the NFL's fourth Scorigami of the season and the SECOND one by Indy. The Colts also had a Scorigami back in Week 9 when they beat the Jets 45-30. The first one of the year came back in Week 6 when the Rams beat the Giants 38-11. Arizona and Houston also had a Scorigami in Week 7 when the Cardinals beat the Texans 31-5.

In the Colts' win over the Bills, the Scorigami almost didn't happen. Going into the fourth quarter, the Colts were ahead 38-7 and if that had been the final score, that wouldn't have been a Scorigami because it's happened 45 times in NFL history.

Early in the fourth quarter, the score changed when Josh Allen hit Stefon Diggs for a touchdown. After the score, the Bills also hit on the two-point conversion to make it 38-15. Although that score is rare, it has happened five times before in NFL history, so that wouldn't have been a Scorigami, either. The Scorigami wasn't locked in until Michael Badgley hit a 35-yard field goal with over six minutes left to make it 41-15.

The Colts then picked off Mitchell Trubisky late in the game to seal the Scorigami. And that's how you get a unique score for the 1,070th time in NFL history.

This has been a surprisingly slow year for Scorigamis with only four. Last year, there were a total of 12 on the season. Of course, it's not surprising to see fewer Scorigamis and that's because every time one hits, that's one final-score option that's taken off the table.

501,New York Giants ,https://www.yahoo.com/sports/tom-brady-reveals-the-nfl-team-he-loves-beating-the-most-and-its-exactly-who-you-think-232202639.html,"Tom Brady became the fourth quarterback in NFL history to defeat all 32 teams after taking down the New England Patriots on Sunday.

Brady has made plenty of rivals since joining the NFL in 2000. The Miami Dolphins have always given him trouble, the Kansas City Chiefs were responsible for his torn ACL, and the Indianapolis Colts and Peyton Manning always provided must-see television.

Beating those teams was likely satisfying, but there's one team Brady enjoys beating even more. If you think about Brady's career for a few seconds, you can probably guess which one.

Yeah, it's the New York Giants.

Brady revealed that tidbit on his podcast ""Let’s Go! With Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald and Jim Gray.” Why the Giants? The Super Bowl losses, of course.

Here's Brady's answer, per NBC Sports.

“Holy cow, that’s a good question,"" Brady said. ""The team I would love to beat the most is the Giants, there’s no doubt about that, because they’ve taken away some really, you know — I’ve always joked with Eli [Manning] but, yeah, and I think he likes that I bring it up all the time. So to bring it up again, I do not like losing to those guys, so when we beat them I love that.""

The choice is understandable. Two of the biggest losses of Brady's career came against the Giants. The two times Brady played the team in the Super Bowl, he lost.

The regular season is a different story. Brady is 5-1 against the Giants. He's thrown eight touchdowns and four interceptions in those games.

Tom Brady praises Patriots after beating them in Week 4

Brady took things a step further and told Gray which team he enjoys beating the least. It's easy to assume Brady harbors bad blood against the Patriots, but that's not the case. He admitted he enjoyed beating his former team the least.

Brady explained it was tough to face off against former teammates.

""And the team I like to beat the least is obviously the Patriots. Again, those are my guys, man. Those are the other warriors that I went to battle with for so long. I’ve had a lot of battles over the years with different teams, there’s a lot of mutual respect in pro sports, but glad I’m through with the one last night.”

Sunday's win might have been bittersweet, but Brady can offset that feeling in a few weeks. The Buccaneers will take on the Giants in Week 11, and Brady won't feel any remorse if he's victorious in that one.",2021-10-06 07:00:12

Matthew Stafford knew where he wanted to go, and he ultimately took matters into his own hands to ensure his desires were fulfilled.

With his Detroit departure imminent, Stafford reportedly zeroed in on the Los Angeles Rams, the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers as his top three potential landing spots. And when a team not on that list became “aggressive” in their pursuit of the veteran quarterback, Stafford intervened.

According to NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport, Stafford nixed a trade to the Carolina Panthers that was gaining steam.

From Rapoport’s report Sunday:

After consulting with his family, he made clear that he wanted to go to the Rams and so did his family. Stafford made his voice heard, and the Lions brass listened.

Suddenly, the Panthers — despite offering a prime first-round pick and Teddy Bridgewater — were out.

As multiple sources explained for the first time, Stafford ultimately steered himself to Los Angeles. He stepped in and stopped a Panthers deal on the verge of happening and caused the Rams to up their offer to include two future first-round picks and Jared Goff.",2021-09-12 08:48:08

Ben Simmons apparently is willing to go west, as so many young men have before.

The Philadelphia 76ers guard no longer is speaking to the team and would accept a trade to the Golden State Warriors, KRON’s Jason Dumas reported Thursday, citing a source. Trade rumors have surrounded Simmons for several weeks, and the Warriors are among the teams the 76ers reportedly have sought out as potential trade partners.

“Source: Ben Simmons has cut off communication with basically everyone in the Sixers organization,” Dumas wrote in a tweet. “Everything is going thru his agent, Rich Paul. Ben is open to going to the GSWs though he doesn’t have much leverage in the situation.”

The Sixers reportedly offered to trade Simmons to the Warriors last month in exchange for a package that included James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins and multiple draft picks. However, Golden State reportedly rejected Philadelphia’s proposal.

Dumas on Thursday offered additional insight about Simmons’ willingness to join the Warriors.

“The situation is getting worse by the day with Ben in Philly,” Dumas said during his appearance on 95.7 The Game’s “The Morning Roast” show, per NBC Sports Bay Area. “It’s a marriage that’s beyond repair at this point.

""hey Alex, just want to let you know they'll fix you right up, you'll be good as new... I'm out here and I don't feel any pain from my injury three years later""
He felt bad because Smith's leg ended up needing 17 surgeries
",https://www.audacy.com/610sports/sports/ryan-fitzpatrick-on-regrettable-text-he-sent-to-alex-smith,"It's always the thought that counts in a nice gesture, and 99 percent of the time, performing said nice gesture leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. But there are also times when this isn't the case — like, for instance, finding out that a co-worker is taking the day off and telling them to enjoy it, only to find out that he/she is missing work for a funeral. Trust me... I know from experience.

And the same goes for Ryan Fitzpatrick, the longtime quarterback who's beloved by fans and players alike but had one innocent gesture that didn't quite turn out the way he had planned. He shared a story about a message he sent to Alex Smith on the ""Green Light with Chris Long"" podcast.

""He was picked No. 1, I was pick No. 250, but he was always really nice to me going through the (draft) process and I've always appreciated him over the years,"" Fitzpatrick said, referring to their 2005 NFL Draft class. ""When Alex broke his leg in that game a few years ago, I had a what I thought was similar injury. I fractured my tibia in 2014 with the Houston Texans and so the single-worst... text I've ever sent out, I sent to Alex.

""And I said, 'hey Alex, just want to let you know they'll fix you right up, you'll be good as new... I'm out here and I don't feel any pain from my injury three years later,' or whatever, whenever it was. And I sent it and felt good about it. And he said, 'Oh, mine might be a little more complicated.' And 17 surgeries later and the story of what he had to overcome, I mean, I felt like the biggest a------ ever.

""...But what he did last year was, it was incredible for him to get back on the field and I was very happy after sending that text that he didn't lose his leg.""

Smith's miraculous recovery story was one of the defining moments — perhaps the defining moment — of the 2020 NFL season, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it was easy for everyone to watch. In fact, it was quite the opposite, and Smith remembers just how poor the conditions were for such a return.

""I think the first [game] that he got put in was against the Rams and it was just images of Aaron Donald jumping on his back and him sitting there having to hold Aaron Donald on his back, and [he] got sacked a bunch that game, and it was pouring rain, and it just seemed like it was a miserable experience,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""I don't want to speak for Alex, but I'll say that I assume that it was such a huge personal challenge for him just to prove that he could do it, that he could come all the way back, and I think it was a really inspirational story for a lot of people watching him do that.""

Smith won Comeback Player of the Year, leading the Washington Football Team to a 5-1 record in his six starts and leading the league in passing yards (390) in just his first start of the season. The fact that he returned from an injury that threatened not only his leg but his whole life was a remarkable way for him to cap off an excellent career. After such an improbable feat, Smith decided to hang 'em up earlier this week.

How would Fitzpatrick sum up Smith's legacy outside of the injury?

""I think, you know, it's a goofy label and sometimes gets used too much, but I'm gonna use it for him,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""He was a winner. I mean, he won when he was in San Fran at the tail end there, when he was in Kansas City, and [it] wasn't always the 300-yard games and five touchdown passes and the way it kind of happens now with some of these young kids.

""But everywhere he went, he made the team better.""

506,"Most consecutive stolen bases without getting caught to begin a career.
",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/diamondbacks-speedster-tim-locastro-sets-mlb-stolen-base-record-with-28th-swiped-bag/,"Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Tim Locastro stole his 28th career base in Saturday night's game against the Cincinnati Reds. With it, Locastro broke the Major League Baseball record for most successful stolen bases to start a career. Since making his MLB debut in 2017 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, he's gone 28 for 28 on his stolen base attempts. His mark of 28 stolen bases passes Hall of Famer Tim Raines, who stole 27 in a row from 1979-81. Records for successful stolen bases attempts have been kept since 1951.

Here's a look at stolen base No. 28:

Locastro, 28, will send his cleats that he wore for the record-breaker to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

""Obviously you always want to get into Cooperstown,"" Locastro told reporters after the game. ""That's what you dream about as a kid, winning the World Series and getting into Cooperstown. So, having my cleats there, that's unfathomable to me.""

The speedy Locastro -- who boasts an elite sprint speed of 30.9 feet per second -- grew up two hours from the Hall of Fame, in Auburn, New York. While Locastro's spikes will be featured in the Hall of Fame, he received second base as a keepsake for breaking the MLB record. The grounds crew at Chase Field retrieved it, and the base was authenticated.

Locastro gave his mom the base after the game:

Locastro's impact wasn't limited to the base paths in the D-Backs' 8-3 win over the Reds. He hit in the leadoff spot (for the third consecutive game) and finished with four singles, two runs scored and the record-breaking stolen base. Locastro will continue filling in as Arizona's regular center fielder in the absence of Ketel Marte, who is on the 10-day injured list with a right hamstring strain.",2021-04-12 10:14:50
507,"Doctors found a blood clot in his lung and were able to treat it successfully.
",https://yhoo.it/2QbpT3y,"NCAA basketball official Bert Smith hasn't watched the moment that might have saved his life.

Smith abruptly collapsed during an Elite Eight game between No. 1 seed Gonzaga and No. 6 seed USC last month in the men's NCAA tournament. It was a scary moment as an audible thud was heard throughout Lucas Oil Stadium, and the official was taken off the court on a stretcher, though he was awake and alert.

Smith told the Indianapolis Star's Gregg Doyel he doesn't remember falling and hasn't seen a replay, but what doctors found that night could have been life-saving.

NCAA ref on stretcher photo

Smith, who became an NCAA Division I official in 1993, said he remembers the play preceding the fall. The action was moving away from his baseline position after a Gonzaga steal, but he said he couldn't move or catch his breath. He felt wobbly and the next thing he remembers seeing is the ceiling of the stadium.

Immediately after falling, Gonzaga assistant coach Tommy Lloyd ran to him and the bench waved for doctors. He was surrounded by medical professionals and eventually was helped on to a stretcher.

He's grumpy in the now-famous photo of him on it and told Doyel he was tricked.

“The doctor said, ‘Listen, tell you what, why don’t you just sit on the stretcher?’ I said OK, I can do that,” Smith says and now he’s laughing. To me, he offers an aside: “He’s taking advantage of a guy in a weakened position.”

He continues the story:

“The doc says, ‘Swing your legs around.’ I swing my legs around, and they go: Click-click-click-click. They strapped me in! I looked at him and said, ‘Oh no you didn’t …’”

He said he told the doctor at the time, ""You little SOB, you tricked me!”

Fall could have saved official's life

The NCAA announced later in the night that Smith was ""alert and stable"" and would not be transported to a hospital. Per the Star, he was treated at the stadium for two hours with vital checks on pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level that came back normal. He didn't have a headache or blurry vision.

Story continues

A few hours later, his officiating friends joined him at the hotel and suggested he go to the hospital to be evaluated for a concussion, just in case. At IU Health Methodist, the 56-year-old Smith was treated by Dr. Katie Trammel, ""an important part of this story.""

Via the Star:

“She sits down next to the bed,” Smith continues, “and she says: ‘I saw your fall tonight. Something doesn’t add up. I want to know why you fell.’ She checked a few things out, came back in and took me through the car wash. Just a lot of tests. And they found out.

“She said: ‘I got the answer to the question. You went down because you had a blood clot in your lung.’”

Smith’s pausing. Dr. Katie Trammel, he’s wanting me to know, may have saved his life.

“You don’t know where that clot was going next,” he says.

Smith was put on blood thinners and discharged two days later with the clot gone. No one knows where the clot came from, per the Star. He said the night before the game, while running the stairs in the hotel to see his buddies or get ice, he was a little out of breath. He gets exercise any time he can and officiates around 90 games a year for the NCAA.

It could have been a red flag, he said doctors told him, but then again ""sometimes it just hits you.""

Smith is back home in Kentucky with his wife, Jacquie, and his grandson, Karter. He said he'll be back officiating next season. He told the Star he's happy it happened during the Elite Eight when he could get the right help he needed rather than during an instance when he was driving or sleeping.

",https://sports.yahoo.com/how-ncaa-rankings-have-tiny-colgate-ahead-of-a-handful-of-powerhouses-221121339.html?ncid=facebook_yahoosport_l0w2dc1068w,"The top seven teams in the NCAA’s NET rankings include unbeaten Gonzaga, one-loss Baylor and a trio of Big Ten heavyweights with national title aspirations.

Then there’s No. 8: A small-conference afterthought that has never won an NCAA tournament game in program history, nor even once appeared in the AP Top 25.

How is Colgate — the No. 2 seed in this week’s Patriot League tournament — ranked ahead of 2019 national champ Virginia, blue blood Kansas and powerhouses Ohio State and Villanova? Even the coach of the Raiders didn’t see this coming.

“It’s a mathematical outlier,” Matt Langel told Yahoo Sports. “It’s an interesting tidbit in what has been the craziest college basketball season in my lifetime.”

The explanation for Colgate’s top-10 NET ranking begins with the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the Patriot League’s schedule. The league did not allow six of its eight teams to start their seasons until Jan. 2. Only Army and Navy were exempt and had permission to schedule games in November and December.

As a result of that decision, the totality of the Patriot League’s non-league schedule this season consists of nine games involving either Army or Navy. Army went 4-1 including a narrow loss to Florida and an impressive win over mid-major power Buffalo. Navy went 3-1 including an upset of Georgetown.

In a normal year, the NET rankings — a metric created to help select and seed NCAA tournament hopefuls — would evaluate the strength of the Patriot League on the results of roughly 100 non-conference games. In this pandemic year, only nine data points are available. Army and Navy outperforming expectations in those nine games is dramatically warping the NET’s perception of the league as a whole.

“Basically, Colgate and the Patriot League are a closed system,” college basketball analytics expert Bart Torvik told Yahoo Sports. “You can't really use results from just this year with no priors of any kind and compare those teams against the rest of D-I because there’s no connectedness.”

Story continues

(Michael Wagstaffe/Yahoo Sports illustration)

Colgate has soared higher in the NET rankings than its Patriot League peers because of its 12-1 record and impressive margin of victory. Because the Patriot League broke its teams into three divisions to help limit travel, Colgate has only played three opponents: Army, Boston University and Holy Cross. The Raiders’ lone loss came by two against Army. They won the rest of their games by an average of nearly 19 points apiece.

“When you beat your opponents by such a huge margin, that shows up,” said data scientist Ed Feng, founder of The Power Rank.

While it’s theoretically possible that the Patriot League could produce a team worthy of a high ranking, recent history suggests it’s unlikely. Only twice in the 2000s has the Patriot League’s NCAA tournament entrant received better than a No. 13 seed. The league has not produced an NCAA tournament victory since 15th-seeded Lehigh toppled mighty Duke in 2012.

Other respected college basketball analytics experts have avoided overrating the Patriot League this season by incorporating data from previous years into their rankings. The assumption that the league would have performed at its recent average level in non-conference play makes a huge difference.

Colgate is 80th in Torvik’s tempo-free rankings. Ken Pomeroy has the Raiders 89th.

“The preseason weighting helps anchor the Patriot League in a more realistic way,” Pomeroy told Yahoo Sports. “The weighting only applies to cases where teams have played few games, so it influences the Patriot League while not being a factor for the vast majority of teams at this point.”

While the NCAA’s algorithm does not include data from previous seasons, Colgate’s top-10 NET ranking isn’t likely to dramatically alter the selection committee’s perception of the Raiders. NCAA spokesman David Worlock cautioned that the NET is “just one tool” and that “other metrics and criteria factor into the committee’s decision for selecting and seeding teams.”

Many mock NCAA tournament brackets project Colgate as a No. 13 or 14 seed if it wins this week’s Patriot League tournament. The Raiders received a No. 15 seed two years ago and lost a first-round matchup to Tennessee.

“I don’t think we’re going to get a seed that is similar to where our NET ranking is or even close,” Langel said, “but my hope is that maybe we can bump up a spot or two.”

The most tangible impact of Colgate’s high NET ranking is that Langel’s phone has rung more often than usual the past few weeks. Coaches of teams on the NCAA tournament bubble keep calling to try to hastily arrange a game.

Stoppages and outbreaks caused an unusual number of teams to scramble to fill holes in their schedules. What better way to do that than by scheduling the Raiders in hopes of earning a résumé-boosting Quadrant 1 victory without having to beat a traditional power?

“I fielded a number of calls from bubble teams as the season was winding down,” Langel said. “My angle was to try to get them to come here. I think a testament to our team is that nobody really had a lot of interest in doing that. They wanted to play us, but they wanted to play us in their venue.”

Colgate’s top-10 NET ranking has also garnered attention from coaches eager to assess how the Raiders did it. They all want to know if this is strictly a COVID anomaly or if there’s a lesson to be learned in how to game the NET in the future.

Among those qualified to answer that question is Matt Dover, co-owner of an analytics company that helps coaches optimize their non-league schedules to maximize their chances of making the NCAA tournament. It’s Dover’s belief that this is simply a “weird artifact of a weird season” — not a loophole to be exploited again and again.

“The NET is built to be pretty hard, if not impossible to game, under normal circumstances,” Dover told Yahoo Sports. “This is just a unique situation caused by the Patriot League playing so few non-conference games. That is leaving the entire league vulnerable to huge statistical swings that there won’t be in future years.”

Could another one-bid league gamble, only play a handful of strategically selected non-league games and hope to outperform expectations the way Army and Navy did this season? In theory, maybe. In reality, too many small-conference teams rely on the revenue generated by playing road non-conference games in return for tens of thousands of dollars.

“What are they going to do?” Dover said. “Totally forgo the option of playing those? Because that’s what you’d have to do. You’d have to limit it to a tiny, tiny sample size. Once you get up to a slightly larger sample size — every team playing a few non-conference games for example — it would be much less likely you’d get something super skewed.”

Yet Reid, the son of Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, remains a free man, still awaiting a Kansas City police investigation to determine whether he’ll face charges.

That continued uncertainty has frustrated many, who in the meantime have followed what remains an ominous prognosis for the 5-year-old girl who was in the backseat of one of the hit vehicles and critically injured during the crash.

Ariel Young woke up from a coma last month. That’s about the only positive news. Her family and their attorney report she remains unresponsive and can neither speak nor walk.

“She likely has permanent brain damage that she will endure for the rest of her life,” Tom Porto, the family’s attorney told ABC.

“She is not the same happy, free-spirited little girl she was before this horrific crash,” her aunt Tiffany Velhurst wrote on a GoFundMe page that is attempting to raise money for the family.

Kansas City Police told Yahoo Sports on Tuesday that the investigation into the incident is ongoing and there are no updates.

KCPD originally stated that similar cases take at least 1-2 months, as it awaits toxicology reports and further investigation. That timetable is still in play. Toxicology results alone in Jackson County, Missouri can sometimes take three months to be returned, according to locals with knowledge of the system.

According to a search warrant to draw blood from Reid, the 35-year-old acknowledged to officers on the scene that he had consumed 2-3 drinks prior to driving and was taking prescription Adderall. He was not arrested on the scene for suspicion of drunk driving or any charge.

The fact Reid was taken to an area hospital, where he underwent surgery for injuries sustained in the crash, may have played a part in that decision. While the lengthy delay in charges remains a topic of discussion, police and independent local defense attorneys say this is standard operating procedure, particularly for a high-profile case involving a critical injury.

Story continues

“While many point to alleged statements made by Mr. Reid to law enforcement as a reason to charge, this was a devastating incident with catastrophic consequences,” said Chris Scott of the Christopher Scott Law Office in Kansas City.

Scott does not represent Britt Reid, but both as a former county prosecutor and now a defense attorney, he has extensive background in DUI cases.

“Law enforcement needs as much information as possible before turning the investigation over to prosecutors for a charging decision,” Scott said. “It could be more than just toxicology results they are waiting for. There could be accident reconstruction taking place, other witnesses needing to be tracked down, or other issues they need to resolve.”

As for a timetable, no one can reasonably know. Police have asked for patience and continue to stress they are doing what they can.

“If toxicology reports are pending, those could come in tomorrow or take weeks or months to come back,” Scott said.

Then and only then will local prosecutors decide whether to pursue charges.

“Ultimately, he will only be arrested if criminal charges are filed,” Scott said.

In a statement last month following the crash, the Chiefs said they were “gathering information” themselves on the situation, but offered no details or update to Yahoo Sports this week. The team instead pointed to their previous statement.

What the Chiefs have found could have a significant impact on the case and the NFL itself. The accident occurred around 9 p.m. on the ramp leading from Stadium Drive to Interstate 435. That’s when Reid struck two vehicles, including one that carried Ariel. Her mother had driven to the spot to aid a cousin who had run out of gas.

It is the most direct route from the Chiefs' facility, where the coaching staff was working to prepare for the Super Bowl, toward Reid’s home in Overland Park, Kansas.

Due to NFL COVID-19 restrictions, Reid was prohibited from visiting any bars, restaurants or even a private residence. Doing so would have prevented not only him but anyone he contact-traced with from working the Super Bowl. Even then, there is no place to drink that would require taking Stadium Drive home.

As such, the suspicion is that Reid was drinking inside the Chiefs' facility, which like all NFL buildings has extensive video and professional surveillance and security.

Reid has a history of legal and substance abuse problems, including a prior DUI in Pennsylvania. The Chiefs overlooked that in the spirit of nepotism and gave Reid a job as their outside linebackers coach.

Reid was quickly suspended by the team following the crash. He did not travel to the Super Bowl, although since he was hospitalized that decision was moot. The team allowed his contract to expire a week after the season and he is not employed in the NFL. The Hunt family, which owns the Chiefs, has been in touch with the family of Ariel Young and is now offering support and resources.

Otherwise, it is still wait-and-see in Kansas City for a frustrated public.

There’s still hope for better days for Ariel, and for details and decisions from Kansas City law enforcement and the Chiefs themselves.

Feelings apparently are not mutual between Carson Wentz and his reported strongest suitor.

During an appearance Monday on FOX Sports 1’s “The Herd,” Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer identified the franchise most likely to acquire the veteran quarterback from the Philadelphia Eagles.

“I think Chicago is the frontrunner this morning, and I do know there’s a feeling inside that building from Ryan Pace, from the coaching staff, Matt Nagy, John DeFilippo (…) they believe, mechanically, they can fix him,” Breer said, as transcribed by NBC Sports Philadelphia.

So what’s the hold-up? Wentz seemingly has been available for trade for a few weeks now, and the Bears are in need of an upgrade under center.

Well, according to Breer, Wentz’s personal desires are serving as a hang-up in trade talks.

“I think the issue right now, Colin, is where Carson Wentz wants to go,” Breer said. “I think it’s become pretty clear he’d rather go to Indianapolis, and I think part of it now, for the Eagles, is, ‘Alright, if our best return now is Chicago over Indy, then we need to convince Carson Wentz, this is the only place you’re going, bud, and you need to buck up and accept this, and realize the Bears are going to give you a good chance.’

“I think it’s pretty clear at this point that the Bears have pushed harder than the Colts to get Carson Wentz. (…) I think the Bears would like to at least know that Carson Wentz is on board before pulling a trigger on a trade.”",2021-02-16 06:26:42

It’s no secret that Rob Gronkowski loves his alcohol. But that doesn’t mean he is an under-prepared, reckless partier.

Gronk on Wednesday arrived at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Super Bowl championship parade carrying not a case of beer, but a case of water. Clearly, the Bucs tight end understood hydration would be imperative on a day in which he would parade and party in 80-degree weather.

Check out this video tweeted by ESPN reporter Jenna Laine:

Smart move, Gronk.

513,"First time the two most recent Super Bowl winning QBs will face each other in the Super Bowl.
",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/why-tom-brady-patrick-mahomes-will-make-super-bowl-history-as-soon-as-they-take-their-first-snaps/,"Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes are used to making history. Brady, with a record six Super Bowl rings already in his possession, will go for a seventh when the Buccaneers face the Chiefs in Super Bowl LV on Feb. 7 on CBS. Brady's counterpart, Patrick Mahomes, made history last year by becoming the first player to win Super Bowl and league MVP honors before his 25th birthday. A win in Super Bowl LV would make Mahomes the youngest quarterback in history to win multiple Super Bowls.

As soon as they take their first snaps in Super Bowl LV, Brady and Mahomes will make even more NFL history. Brady and Mahomes will become the first winning quarterbacks from the previous two Super Bowls to face each other in the Super Bowl, as noted by NFL Network's Rich Eisen. Brady is two years removed from leading the Patriots to a 13-3 win over the Rams in Super Bowl LIII. Last February, Mahomes rallied the Chiefs to a come-from-behind win over the 49ers to claim Kansas City's first title in 50 years.

While the previous two Super Bowl winning quarterbacks have never faced each other in the Super Bowl, there have been six previous Super Bowls played between quarterbacks who had already won a Super Bowl. Here's a look at the quarterbacks who took part in those games.

Super Bowl Quarterbacks Result X Roger Staubach (DAL), Terry Bradshaw (PIT) Steelers 21, Cowboys 17 XIII Roger Staubach (DAL), Terry Bradshaw (PIT) Steelers 35, Cowboys 31 XVIII Jim Plunkett (LAR), Joe Theismann (WAS) Raiders 38, Washington 9 XLIII Ben Roethlisberger (PIT), Kurt Warner (ARI) Steelers 27, Cardinals 23 XLVI Tom Brady (NE), Eli Manning (NYG) Giants 21, Patriots 17 XLIX Tom Brady (NE), Russell Wilson (SEA) Patriots 28, Seahawks 24

In the previous six games between Super Bowl winning quarterbacks, a quarterback took home the MVP award on three occasions. In Super Bowl XIII, Bradshaw, the league's MVP that season, won his first of two consecutive Super Bowl MVP awards after throwing for 318 yards and four touchdowns in Pittsburgh's second Super Bowl win over Dallas. In the second half of Super Bowl XLVI, Eli Manning helped engineer three scoring drives to help the Giants win their second Super Bowl over the Patriots. In Super Bowl XLIX, Brady's two fourth quarter touchdown passes gave him his fourth Super Bowl ring and third Super Bowl MVP award.

Brady is 2-1 in the Super Bowl against quarterbacks that have already won a ring. His first Super Bowl win came at the expense of Kurt Warner, whose Rams fell to the Patriots in one of the greatest upsets in Super Bowl history. Sandwiched between that win and the Patriots' win over the Seahawks is New England's four-point loss to Eli Manning's Giants in Super Bowl XLVI. Four years earlier, Manning and the Giants had stunned Brady and the previously undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII, 17-14. Overall, Brady is 6-3 in the Super Bowl, and his six Super Bowl wins are two more than the second-winningest Super Bowl quarterbacks: Bradshaw and Joe Montana. His four Super Bowl MVP awards are one more than Montana, who went 4-0 in Super Bowls as the 49ers' quarterback.

The specter of facing the most experienced quarterback in Super Bowl history is not lost on Mahomes, who was asked about his soon-to-be Super Bowl counterpart following Kansas City's victory over Buffalo.

""Yeah I mean, the Super Bowl is the Super Bowl. Being able to go up against one of the greatest, if not the greatest quarterback of all time in his 150th Super Bowl,"" said Mahomes, who is 1-1 against Brady in his career. ""I mean it's going to be a great experience for me. To go out there and get to have a chance to repeat and get to do it against the best, I mean it's something special and I'm excited for the opportunity.""",2021-01-26 07:30:32
514,"Every time Tom Brady lost in Week 1, he made it to the Super Bowl.
",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-has-an-improbable-streak-going-that-he-can-keep-alive-with-a-playoff-win-over-the-packers/,"No team wants to lose during the first week of the regular season, but if Tom Brady is your quarterback, losing can actually be a good thing and that's because Brady currently has a pretty wild streak going that's tied to how his team does in the regular season opener.

Over the course of his 21-year career, Brady has made the Super Bowl in every season where he's lost in Week 1 and that streak will continue this year if Tampa Bay can beat the Packers in Sunday's NFC Championship. In his career, Brady has been the starting quarterback in 19 openers and in those games, he's gone 15-4 as the starter. The first three Week 1 losses resulted in Super Bowl appearances and now, he'll be hoping the fourth Week 1 loss does the same.

Back in Week 1, the Buccaneers lost to New Orleans 34-23, but then they rebounded to go 11-4 over their final 15 games before winning two playoff games to get where they are now.

Here's a look at what happened in the other three seasons where Brady lost in Week 1.

2003

Week 1: 31-0 loss to Buffalo.

The opening week of the 2003 season was arguably one of the most disastrous games of Brady's career in New England. In a road game at Buffalo, Brady completed just 14 of 28 passes for 123 yards while also throwing FOUR interceptions in a 31-0 loss. The blowout loss must have served as a wake-up call because the Patriots would go 14-1 over the rest of the season.

End result: Won Super Bowl XXXVIII. Despite the loss in the opener, Brady and the Patriots still bounced back to make it to the Super Bowl, where they faced the Carolina Panthers. In a 32-29 win over the Panthers, Brady took home the Super Bowl MVP award thanks to a performance that included 354 passing yards and three touchdowns.

2014

Week 1: 33-20 loss to Miami.

During Brady's career, the Patriots always had a tough time playing in Miami and the opening week of the 2014 season was no different. Although the Patriots led 20-10 at halftime, the Dolphins dominated the second half by outscoring New England 23-0.

End result: Won Super Bowl XLIX. The 2014 season marked the first time in 11 years that the Patriots had lost in Week 1, but like they did in 2003, they rebounded with a Super Bowl win. Although Brady threw for 328 yards and four touchdowns, this game is mostly remembered for the fact that the Seahawks didn't give the ball to Marshawn Lynch at the one-yard line on their final offensive play of the game.

2017

Week 1: 42-27 loss to Kansas City.

This is the only opening-week loss of Brady's career that came at home and it was an embarrassing one. In the Thursday night opener, the Patriots got outscored 21-0 in the fourth quarter. Brady got outplayed by Alex Smith, who threw for 368 yards and four touchdowns.

End result: Made it to Super Bowl LII: Like every opening week loss of Brady's career, this season also ended with a Super Bowl appearance. The only difference this time around is that the Patriots didn't actually win the Super Bowl. Despite an NFL-playoff record 505 yards from Brady, the Patriots were still beaten by the Eagles 41-33.

If the Buccaneers can beat the Packers this week, Brady's improbable streak will continue.

515,NFL's top-two rushing teams facing each other in the playoffs. ,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ravens-at-titans-playoff-game-will-feature-something-the-nfl-postseason-hasnt-seen-in-32-years/,"It's not often you see the NFL's top-two rushing teams face each other in the playoffs, but that's exactly what will be happening on Sunday in Nashville when Tennessee hosts Baltimore for a wild-card game.

In an era where nearly every team in the NFL loves to throw the ball, the Ravens and Titans have gone against the grain and their throwback strategy means we're going to be getting a postseason rarity: This week's game will mark the first time in nearly 32 years that the NFL's top-two rushing teams have faced each other in the playoffs.

The last time it happened came in January 1989 when the Bengals and 49ers met up in Super Bowl XXIII. In that game, the 49ers and their No. 2 rushing offense narrowly beat a Bengals team that ranked No. 1 overall in rushing in 1988. Although the Bengals had the NFL MVP on their team that year in Boomer Esiason, they still managed to average 169.4 yards per game on the ground. As for the 49ers, their ground attack averaged 157.6 yards per game even though they had Joe Montana under center.

Neither team came anywhere close to their season average as the 49ers totaled 111 rushing yards while the Bengals ended with 106 yards in San Francisco's 20-16 Super Bowl win.

The Ravens-Titans game will mark the just the fourth time that the top-two rushing teams have met in the postseason since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. Besides Super Bowl XXIII, there was also the 1972 AFC Championship that featured an undefeated Dolphins team (211.4 yards per game during the season) going up against the Steelers (180 yards per game). The other meeting came in the 1970 divisional round between the Cowboys (164.3) and Lions (151.9).

In the three previous meetings, the team that led the NFL in rushing yards has gone 2-1 with the Dolphins (21-17) and Cowboys (5-0) both winning. Also, that is not a typo, the Cowboys won a playoff game 5-0.

This year, Baltimore will be going into the postseason on the heels of winning the regular season rushing title. The Ravens averaged 191.9 yards per game on the ground this year, which led the NFL by more than 20 yards. The only team that even came close to matching them was the Titans, who finished second overall with an average of 168.1 yards per game (No other team in the NFL even averaged 150 yards). Not only did they rank one and two in rushing this year, they were also two of the three teams in the NFL that called more run plays than pass plays in 2020 (The Patriots were the other one).

Although they were the top-two teams in rushing yards, there was a stark difference in how they got there. The Titans are more a one-man show while the Ravens are more of a running back by committee. The Ravens had three players finish the year with more than 700 yards rushing, including Lamar Jackson, who ended the season with 1,005.

As for the Titans, Derrick Henry finished the season with 2,027 yards, which is the fifth-highest total in NFL history. Henry could continue to make history on Sunday: If he hits the 150-mark, he'll tie Terrell Davis for the most games in playoff history with at least 150 yards rushing.

The run game will be important to both teams, but it will probably be slightly more important to the Titans and that's because they went 2-3 this year in games where they got out-rushed by their opponent and 9-2 when they had more rushing yards. As for the Ravens, they went 3-2 when they got out-rushed and 8-3 when they had more yards on the ground than their opponent.

This game will mark the third time these two teams have faced each other over the past 12 months and not only did the Titans win both games, but they out-rushed the Ravens each time.",2021-01-10 08:03:54
516,"Mets and Blue Jays
",https://bit.ly/38OMLeT,"The Mets and Blue Jays have long been considered the front-runners to land Astros free agent George Springer, and now, according to at least one report, they are the final two teams competing for the high-priced center fielder.

The New York Daily News' Deesha Thosar cited a source Wednesday that says Springer is expected to pick between those two finalists in January.

SAD TIMES: Josh Reddick has woo'ed his last 'Woo' with the Astros

SNY baseball reporter Andy Martino confirms that the Mets and Blue Jays are ""seriously interested"" in Springer, but that the Mets aren't as close to a deal as some have reported. Martino says the five-year, $125 million contract for Springer that has been floated is off and that Springer is asking for ""well over $150 million.""

MLB Network's Jon Heyman says the Mets and Blue Jays are engaged in a ""spirited derby"" for Springer as they bid against each other. He also says a deal could take a while as neither team has come close to Springer's asking price, but the Mets should be considered the favorite.

The Mets always have made the most sense as a Springer landing spot with new owner Steve Cohen looking to make a splash by opening up his wallet. Springer also grew up in New Britain, Conn., which is just about 100 miles from the Mets' Citi Field. Springer's wife Charlise grew up in upstate New York, also just about an hour-and-a-half drive from the Mets' home.

This is Springer's first chance to cash in on the free agent market. Before the 2020 season was shortened and salaries were prorated, Springer signed a one-year contract with the Astros worth $21 million. In November, Springer rejected the Astros' one-year, $18.9 million qualifying offer, which was a formality as the Astros had to offer that in order to receive draft compensation if he signs elsewhere.

If Springer signs with the Mets, it will be the second straight offseason an Astros free agent was lured from Houston by big money in New York. Last year, Astros pitcher Gerrit Cole signed with the Yankees for nine years and $324 million, the fourth-largest deal in baseball history.

The 31-year-old Springer will always be one of the faces of the Astros first championship. He was the 2017 World Series MVP, tying a record with five home runs in the seven game series. He homered in each of the final four games of that series against the Dodgers, setting a record for most consecutive games with a home run in the World Series.

Springer, who was the Astros' first-round pick in 2011, ranks fifth on the franchise's all-time home run list with 174 in seven seasons. His .491 career slugging percentage is sixth-best in Astros history.",2020-12-31 17:54:47

Team Canada captain Kirby Dach is out of the 2021 World Juniors after suffering a wrist injury in Wednesday’s pre-tournament game against Russia.

The Blackhawks talented prospect needs to head back to Chicago to undergo further examination by team doctors and a potential surgery for his gruesome injury.

We say gruesome because on Christmas morning, a picture of Dach’s dismantled wrist was revealed on social media, and it is simply not the Christmas present he was hoping for…

We warn you, this ain’t pretty…

The sad thing is that Dach appeared to get injured on a harmless bodycheck in the neutral zone in the third period of the preliminary game against Russia on Wednesday night.

Right after contact, the young captain pulled off his glove, skated off the ice and went directly to the locker-room area. He probably saw what you just did above…

Gross.

This is heartbreaking for Dach who was so excited to represent his country for the first time as he was not loaned to the team when the Canadians captured gold last year in the Czech Republic.

Against the Chargers on Thursday night, the Raiders quarterback was thrust into action in the first quarter after starter Derek Carr suffered a groin injury that sidelined him for the rest of the game. Because the injury happened with three full quarters to play, that opened the door for Mariota to not only see significant playing time but earn a serious raise in the process.

This offseason, Mariota inked a two-year, $17.6 million contract to join Las Vegas and back up Carr. As Field Yates of ESPN points out, there's an incentive to Maritoa's contact that if he plays more than 60% of the snaps in any game in 2020, he earns a crisp $200K. That payday could have reached $325K had the Raiders won, but Justin Herbert's goal-line plunge in overtime booted any chance of that extra $125K landing in Mariota's pocket.

Don't feel too bad for him though as his base salary for 2021 has now increased by $625K thanks to playing in more than 60% of their offensive snaps in this matchup as well. That means, Mariota made around $825K for his efforts against Los Angeles. Not too shabby for a Thursday night out in Vegas.

Despite being on the losing end, Mariota was extremely impressive and nearly had the Raiders pulling out the win. The former No. 2 overall pick completed over 60% of his throws for 226 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He also rushed for a game-high 88 yards and added another score with his legs. While a lot may be made about this quick cash-grab against Los Angeles following Carr's injury, this performance could even lead to a bigger payout if some quarterback-needy team this offseason sees Mariota as a potential starter for them in 2021. At that point, it'd be safe to say he's on a heater.",2020-12-18 08:13:00

MLB might’ve tipped their hand at the Cleveland baseball team’s new team name, via the U.S. Patent and Trademark office.

A New York Times report late Sunday revealed that the “Cleveland Indians” moniker would be no more. That was confirmed on Monday afternoon by team owner Paul Dolan, who said that the organization would part ways with the team name after 105 years following discussions with Native American groups. However, the change won’t take place until after the 2021 season at the earliest.

Some names that have been floated around are the Cleveland Spiders and the Rockers. However, the MLB might’ve tipped their hand on the team’s newest nickname. That name is the “Cleveland Citizens,” which appears to be registered by the league in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

not sure how much to read into this if at all, but ""Cleveland Citizens"" appears to be a trademark registered by MLB under the US Patent & Trademark Office (h/t @matt07555207) https://t.co/1vrGXk7e2T — Ben Nicholson-Smith (@bnicholsonsmith) December 14, 2020

Citizens a potential name for the Cleveland baseball team

When looking at the name, the trademark was filed on Aug. 17, 2020. While the league appears to have filed the trademark, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will ultimately be the new name. Rather, it would be more of a move to prevent someone else from filling out an application at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, so the league won’t have to negotiate a deal.

Momentum for Cleveland changing their name arrived after the Washington Football Team distanced themselves from their former insensitive moniker back in July. The Football Team name was initially used as a placeholder, but team president Jason Wright told ESPN that it was in the running to become the permanent name.

On Opening Day for the 2020 season, the Cleveland baseball team wore their navy blue road jerseys which had the city name on the front to support the name change.

Creating a new name for a sports team does take time, because they have to file trademarks for the name and the logo. It’s a lengthy process, but Dolan confirmed that they’re heading in the right direction and moving on from their previous moniker.",2020-12-15 12:50:32

The Jets are expected to fire head coach Adam Gase following the season (or before it ends). New York has yet to win a game this season and is on track to get the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.

While it’s been a disappointing season for the Jets, the head coaching vacancy could be an attractive one.

New York has some young talent and is expected to add generational quarterback prospect Trevor Lawrence in the NFL Draft. The Jets could attract some big names to their soon-to-be-vacant coaching position.

Cowher, who led the Pittsburgh Steelers to a Super Bowl, was linked to the job this week. However, he’s made it clear that he won’t be returning to the sideline.

“I have no interest in coaching,” Cowher told ESPN.

Cowher added that he has no interest in coaching and won’t discuss any jobs.

521,January 15th ,https://info.hockeyfeed.com/nhl-news/new-projected-start-date-for-2021-season-revealed,"Friday is a good day. And this Friday is even better than that!



Earlier this morning, TSN Senior Hockey Reporter Frank Seravalli reported that the National Hockey League has shared draft schedules with the NHLPA on Thursday, including a 56-game season outline.

While Seravalli pointed out that the schedules were all based on a Jan. 1 start date, the two sides had discussed pushing that date back until later in the month.

And now his colleague insider Pierre LeBrun reveals that the plan is now to see the 2021 season get underway on Jan. 15, which could allow teams to get training camps going after the Christmas break.

A Jan. 15 start is now being discussed, source says, really no choice given that Jan 1 doesn’t seem realistic at this point. Economic issues still unresolved but both sides keep talking about other issues around season planning. As Frank says below, some positive vibes https://t.co/0uMf6FViG2 — Pierre LeBrun (@PierreVLeBrun) December 4, 2020

Elliotte Friedman also confirms the report on Friday morning.

Latest details as far as I know https://t.co/fZgeON6uEi — Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) December 4, 2020

For the past weeks, it sounded like the NHL was refusing to stray from its original goal of starting the season on Jan. 1, despite the fact that this projected date is just a month away and the format has yet to be determined. However, this new development sounds like a positive one despite the fact that the start date is getting pushed.

Now, we all know, many more details need to be ironed out. Players aren’t happy about too many things, especially that the NHL has reportedly asked for players to defer 20% of their salaries while escrow increases to 25%. And this despite the fact that both sides agreed to a new six-year collective bargaining agreement before the league’s return to play over the summer that accounted for the expected financial repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The union agreed to 10% salary deferrals with escrow capping at 20%. That money was agreed to be paid in three equal, interest-free instalments in October 2022, 2023, 2024.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman insisted Wednesday that the NHL is “not seeking to renegotiate” the six-year Collective Bargaining Agreement extension that was unanimously ratified by owners in July.

“We’re not actually having negotiations and we’re not seeking to renegotiate,” Bettman said. “We made a number of assumptions collectively over the summer, most of which are not applicable anymore.



“Whatever the revenues are, the players only get 50 per cent. And if we overpay them and they don’t pay us back in the short term, they have to pay us back over time. There will be stresses on the system, and we’ve had discussions about what those stresses are, and how they might be dealt with. But we’re not trying to say ‘You must do X, Y and Z.’ We’re trying to look for ways to continue to work together.”

It has since been reported that players are weighing options to sue the NHL if it chooses to cancel the 2021 season. However, at the moment, this sounds like pretty good news to see puck drop in early 2021, possibly Jan. 15th.",2020-12-04 09:00:04
522,Matthew Stafford. The quote came from an unnamed coach. ,https://www.knbr.com/2020/11/30/would-win-super-bowl-coach-believes-49ers-should-trade-for-veteran-quarterback/,"

© Kirby Lee | 2020 Nov 29

For those hoping the 49ers move on from Jimmy Garoppolo this offseason, an intriguing possibility became more likely this week.

The Detroit Lions axed much maligned head coach Matt Patricia after another disappointing loss on Thanksgiving. With the Lions essentially bottoming out this season, a full rebuild is on the horizon, and now discussions are ongoing around the league regarding what the Lions should do with veteran quarterback Matt Stafford, who will be 33 before the 2021 season.

According to one NFL offensive coach, the 49ers should trade for him if he’s made available.

“They would win a Super Bowl,” an offensive coach said via Mike Sando of The Athletic. “Stafford would be in a real organization finally. He would bend to Shanahan and that offense because there is such a history of success with that system. And Stafford would know he’s not going to get hit in the head all the time like in Detroit.”

Imagining Stafford as the 49ers’ QB is all well and good, but acquiring him wouldn’t necessarily be all that easy. First off, Stafford has a cap hit of $34 million next season and nearly $28 million in 2022. That’s more than the $26.4 million and $27 million that Garoppolo is owed in the next two seasons, and would likely hinder the 49ers’ ability to re-sign a few of their many upcoming free agents that includes Trent Williams and nearly the entire secondary.

It all depends on what the Lions want in return and how much the 49ers value a quarterback nearing the end of his prime. Stafford’s arm talent is fairly undeniable, and he’s still putting up numbers (261.5 yards per game, 18 touchdowns to 8 picks, 92.7 rating) on a very questionable Lions team.

Sure the 49ers as currently constructed with Stafford could be Super Bowl hopefuls, but would what they lose in bringing on Stafford keep them in that conversation?",2020-12-01 16:05:05

The NBA has welcomed plenty of amazing point guards from the draft in recent years. While this year’s crop is not considered as deep as the previous ones, most pundits believe that LaMelo Ball has the brightest future at that position.

Duke Blue Devils legendary head coach Mike Krzyzewski, however, completely disagrees with the public consensus and made a case why his point guard Tre Jones is a much safer bet than the controversial Ball. Coach K appeared on NBA TV and gushed over what makes the 6-foot-2 guard a truly special talent for teams looking for a floor general.

“I’d take Tre in a heartbeat. I think he’s the best point guard in the draft. He’s another guy that can come in and play right away.

During the Buccaneers' 38-3 loss to the Saints, Tampa Bay somehow only managed five rushing attempts, which set the NFL record for fewest rushing attempts in a game.

To say Tampa Bay gave up on the run would definitely be an understatement, because it was worse than that. It was almost like the Bucs forgot the run existed. After calling two run plays in the first quarter, they would only call two for the rest of the game. The crazy thing is that Tampa Bay was on track to finish the game with just four rushing attempts, but it ended up reaching five because Blaine Gabbert's kneel down on the final play of the game counted as a rushing attempt.

Here's what the box score looked like for the Bucs at the end of the game:

Ronald Jones: Three carries for 9 yards.

Leonard Fournette: One carry for 0 yards.

Blaine Gabbert: One carry for -1 yard.

If you're scoring at home, that's five carries for 8 yards. Before Sunday, the NFL record for fewest carries in a game was six and that had actually been done four times. In a twist of fate, Tom Brady was also involved in one of those games.

Here's a quick look at the the four games that previously held the record. The Chicago Cardinals first set the record in 1933 and then it stood for 87 years.

Chicago Cardinals vs. Boston Redskins, Oct. 22, 1933: The Cardinals couldn't get anything going in this game as they totaled just six carries in a 10-0 loss to Boston. Final score: Boston 10-0 over Chicago.

New England Patriots vs. Pittsburgh Steelers Oct. 31, 2004: The Patriots had to abandon the run early in this game after falling behind 24-3 in the first half. Brady ended up throwing 43 passes in a game where the Patriots rushed just six times for five yards. The Patriots were 6-0 going into this game, but fell to 6-1 after losing to the Steelers. The Patriots' leading rusher was Kevin Faulk, who had five carries for 4 yards. Final score: Steelers 34-20 over Patriots.

Minnesota Vikings vs. Buffalo Bills, Sept. 23, 2018: This ended up being one of the biggest upsets in NFL history as the 16.5-point underdog Bills would shock the Vikings. In this game, Minnesota gave up on the run after Buffalo jumped out to a 27-0 lead in the first half. The Vikings' leading rusher in this game was Mike Boone, who carried the ball two times for 11 yards. As a team, the Vikings finished with six carries for 14 yards. Final score: Bills 27-6 over Vikings.

Like the Buccaneers, all four of these teams lost. As far as rushing attempts go, the magic number seems to be nine. If you don't hit that number, then you have no chance of winning in the NFL. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, there have been 20 games where a team had eight carries or less and those 20 teams have gone 0-20.

The Seahawks, Broncos and 49ers were fined an additional $250,000. The three fines added up to $1.05 million.

The fines came a week after Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive VP of football operations, sent a strongly worded memo to all 32 teams reminding them of the importance of wearing face covering during games. The memo also stated that future discipline could be enforced to coaches who don't comply with the league's rules. This season, any non-player in the ""bench area,"" which is defined as each sideline between the 30-yard lines, is required to wear a mask at all times.

""We must remain vigilant and disciplined in following the processes and protocols put in place by not only the league, union and clubs, but also by state and local governments,"" the memo read. ""Failure to adhere to this requirement will result in accountability measures being imposed against offending individuals and/or clubs ... Becoming careless or ignoring face covering and physical distancing requirements will put the 2020 season at risk.""

While he was not fined on Monday, Rams coach Sean McVay said that he did hear from the league following his team's Week 1 win over the Cowboys. McVay told reporters that he figured that the league's memo ""was directed at me.""

""I've got to do a better job about that,"" McVay said with regard to wearing a mask during games. ""So moving forward there will be a conscious effort to do that.""

Knox’s plea may have been a bit premature at the time. However, with star running back Saquon Barkley likely done for the season with a torn ACL, his vision may soon come to fruition.

NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport has reported that the Giants plan to bring in the ex-Atlanta Falcons starting running back Devonta Freeman for a workout. Freeman, who spent the weekend visiting an NFC East foe in the Philadelphia Eagles, “should be” visiting with Big Blue on Monday.

From @GMFB : The #Giants lost RB Saquon Barkley for the season with an ACL tear, based on initial tests, and they plan to bring in Devonta Freeman to see if the former #Falcons star replaces him. pic.twitter.com/4DEUVYuMgp

Freeman Still Offers Upside as a Dual-Threat Weapon

Freeman has endured a notable whirlwind offseason, which included rejecting a deal from the Seattle Seahawks earlier this spring. Since then, he reportedly threatened retirement and switched agents. He’s receiving a few bites but has left every visit without a contract, this after his new agent Drew Rosenhaus vowed to find Freeman employment by “late July.”

Despite the NFL’s reluctance to commit to Freeman, he’s still just 28-years-old and a viable enough talent to help an NFL roster. While he may no longer be the player who tied David Johnson for the lead-league in total touchdowns by a running back in 2015, Freeman’s multi-faceted skillset makes him a feasible placeholder for Barkley until 2021.

The former second-team All-Pro saw a downtick in his rushing prowess this past season, averaging just 3.6 yards per carry on the ground over his 14 games. With that said, he had averaged a far superior 4.53 ypc. over the five seasons prior. Not to mention, Freeman still remains one of the league’s better receiving backs, hauling in 59 receptions in 2019, ranked eighth-most amongst players at his position.

The Giants don’t have a clear answer to losing Barkley, who went down early in the second quarter of Sunday’s loss to the Chicago Bears. But then again, no team would. Offseason addition Dion Lewis tried his best to shoulder the load in Barkley’s absence in Week 2, yet mustered up a mere 20-rushing yards on 10 carries.

Wayne Gallman, the only other running back on the Giants’ current roster, was a healthy scratch on Sunday. Expect Gallman to be tossed into action this coming week against a battered San Francisco 49ers team. Gallman has shown himself capable of producing as a go-to option in spot situations, most notably a 118-yard, two-touchdown performance back in Week 4 of last season.

Despite the duo of Lewis and Gallman, the Giants will be on the search for reinforcements in the backfield, a search which may just so happen to end with them adding a former two-time Pro Bowler into the fold.",2020-09-21 18:38:04

The Patriots have signed former Bengals QB Jake Dolegala to their practice squad. Quality move for the St. Francis High grad. — Tim Graham (@ByTimGraham) September 15, 2020

Newton, who is 6-foot-5, is one of the bigger quarterbacks in the league, but Dolegala might make him look a bit little small.

Follow the Heavy on Patriots Facebook page for the latest breaking news, rumors, and content!

Where Is Dolegala From?

Dolegala played for four years at Central Connecticut. As a senior in 2018, he completed 61% of his passes, threw for 2,221 yards and 16 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions. He wasn’t drafted in 2019, but was a part of the Cincinnati Bengals’ camp this year and in 2019 where he performed well.

During the 2019 preseason, Dolegala completed 37-of-61 passes for 347 yards and 2 touchdowns. There was some thought he could be a developmental prospect in Cincinnati, but once the team drafted Joe Burrow No. 1 overall in 2020, it was clear Dolegala was expendable, even as an option to supply depth.

The Patriots must have had an eye on him last year and in 2020 because they brought him in to be a part of the practice squad.

What Role Is He Going to Play on the Practice Squad?

For now, Dolegala is just on the practice squad to provide some depth. He is the only quarterback on the practice squad with the team having released Brian Lewerke. If for no other reason, Dolegala gives the Patriots a young player who can learn their system and continue to give wide receiver prospects like Devin Ross and Isaiah Zuber some work.

Could He Be a Developmental Quarterback?

With his height, strong arm and solid decision-making, Dolegala has some potential. However, he’d need to really show himself to be quite the quick study for him to make a big enough of a mark with the team to justify any level of security. To be honest, I’d be surprised if he was still a part of the team, in any capacity, by the end of the season.

Perhaps he’ll be a surprise and push Jarrett Stidham as the best young quarterback on the roster.

One could describe Bill Belichick in any number of ways.

He’s The Hoodie. The GOAT. A legend whose football acumen is renowned across the NFL.

But for some, a nickname given to Belichick early in his coaching career might perfectly encapsulate the New England Patriots’ head man.

Here’s an excerpt from “The Dynasty,” by Jeff Benedict, which The Athletic shared Wednesday in wake of the book’s publication:

One of Belichick’s nicknames was Doom. Bill Parcells had given it to him when Belichick was his defensive coordinator for the Giants. “We used to call him Doom because every time he walked around it was the end of the world,” ex-Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor said. “‘Ah, you didn’t make this play.’ ‘Ah, you didn’t go over here.’ It was the end of the world.”

The nickname fit Belichick’s dour demeanor, which fed into his tendency to focus on and prepare for scenarios that most coaches overlooked. “Looking at the negative side and preparing for the negative has made him a better football coach, because he prepares for all of the things that can go bad,” said Patriots defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel. “And to tell you the truth, I think he kind of halfway liked the idea that people were calling him Doom because that way, he didn’t have to be nice to anybody.”

“It’s clear there was a ton of interest between the Patriots and Cam Newton,” Giardi said. “The moment Newton was released, there was a phone call made immediately and then both sides did their due diligence. As you heard Belichick say, they felt comfortable enough to sort of create this union and obviously Cam felt the same.”

Not only were the Patriots able to land Newton on a discount, they also added a highly motivated player who will be entering somewhat of a “make or break” season. So despite what the Colin Cowherds of the world might say, New England’s investment in Newton could prove to look genius.",2020-08-04 09:43:40

If you ask diehard New York Mets fans what their favorite moment was, they might bring up their 1969 and 1986 World Series championships. But deep down inside, Mets fans were ecstatic once team-killer and Atlanta Braves legend Chipper Jones finally retired from the MLB. Jones has fueled Mets fanatics dreams with nightmares, because he always found a way to play at his best in Queens, NY.

Even years after his retirement, Jones is still living rent free in the heads of the Mets. Do you need proof? Well, look no further than Jones having a cardboard cutout at Citi Field during the Braves’ regular season opener against the Mets.

Was Chipper responsible for this?

It’s unknown if Jones purchased the cardboard cutout to be seated front row at Citi Field. But whoever did it, we give you major props. This is an amazing troll job.

In Jones’ 19-year career, Jones always rose to the occasion once he went to battle against the Mets. Jones played 245 games against New York, and he managed to slash .309/.406/.543 while hitting 49 home runs and 159 RBI, per Baseball Reference.

Jones always loved playing the Mets on the road, specifically at the old Shea Stadium. He loved the old ballpark so much, that he named his son Shea, who just so happens to have a cardboard cutout at Citi Field alongside his old man!

Mets fans were looking forward to the start of the season, but now they’re getting mocked by the man they sarcastically called “Larry” every time he visited the Big Apple. Well, by a picture of Jones to be exact.",2020-07-24 15:30:43

According to The Athletic, Manning pulled in a total of $3.36 million, making him the only player on the NFLPA's royalty list who cracked the $3 million mark last year. At this point, Manning could probably just live off his royalties if he wanted to.

The royalty numbers come from the NFL Players Association and the earnings only take into account the sales of things that the NFLPA licenses, such as jerseys, video games, and trading cards. Manning likely made millions from his Nationwide commercials and Brady likely made millions doing endorsements for companies like Aston Martin and UGGs, but those aren't included in the total since those companies don't sell NFLPA licensed merchandise.

The earnings year ended on February 29, 2020, which means the royalty totals covered all of the 2019 season. Manning has managed to stay popular, despite the fact that he hasn't played in an NFL game since winning Super Bowl 50, which took place in February 2016. Mahomes, this year's Super Bowl winning quarterback, pulled in a total of $2.78 million in royalties, which ranked third behind Brady, who pulled in $2.99 million.

There's a good chance that Brady will top this list next year, and that's because his jersey has been flying off the racks since March when he signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Of the top 10 royalty earners, only six of them cracked the $2 million mark. Besides Manning, Brady and Mahomes, Dak Prescott ($2.56 million), Saquon Barkley ($2.34 million) and JuJu Smith-Schuster ($2.19 million) all pulled in more than $2 million in royalties.

According to data obtained by This Is Money, seven million European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) cards are due to expire this year. If caught out, tourists will have to pay more in medical bills than expected.

This further adds to the worries of UK citizens who fear Brexit could mean the loss of cheaper medical bills abroad.

When in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, EHIC cards enable the holder to receive emergency medical care at the same cost and standard as state-provided care in the country.

According to the NHS, this means cardholders receive treatment “at a reduced cost or, in many cases, for free.”

After submitting a freedom of information request to the NHS business services authority, This Is Money revealed that 7,196,592 EHIC cards are set to expire this year.

The number expiring this year is unprecedented and marks an increase of 66% when compared with 2015.

Last year 4,333,892 cards expired, whilst only 2,797,576 expired in 2014. However, data is only stored for two years and This Is Money warned: “This wasn’t reflective of the whole of that year”.

✕ Brussels welcomes appointment of May as British PM

The findings suggest that a large number of UK tourists are set to be caught out if they produce an expired EHIC card when in Europe. Failure to produce a valid card may result in expensive private medical treatment.

Reminders are not sent out to EHIC cardholders and it is the responsibility of the owner to renew his card.

All adults over the age of 16 require their own EHIC card to benefit from the reduced cost in medical expenses. An EHIC card is free but This Is Money warned: “several websites have been set up in the past few years selling EHIC cards for a fee.

“However, these sites are a scam and you… can apply for an EHIC card through the official EHIC website, by calling 0300 330 1350 or by printing an application on the NHS website.”",2016-07-14 12:00:01

Now, 70 years later, high-tech imaging techniques have helped shine a light onto the dark – yet profoundly inspirational – story of what took place there.

An international team of archaeologists has uncovered a 35-meter (115-foot) long tunnel that Jewish prisoners secretly dug with spoons and their bare hands to escape a Nazi massacre site in Lithuania's Ponar forest, a site where 100,000 people had been killed.

Researchers from Israel, Lithuania, Canada, and the US used electrical resistivity tomography to avoid disturbing the bodies in the mass graves, an imaging technique commonly used in mineral and oil exploration that shows up changes in electrical properties underground. Their imaging showed that a tunnel started in a pit, used to imprison the captives, and led to an open space in the forest.

Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, campaigned in support of Brexit and told GQ’s political correspondent Rupert Myers to “suck it up” during a brief exchange on Twitter on Sunday evening.

Myers had written: “I can’t get over the fact that the winning side lied about a whole bunch of stuff and yet expect us to live cheerfully with the result.”

The MP replied: “I know you’re struggling to cope with representative democracy & the decision of 17m people to disagree with you but chin up.”

Mr Jackson’s comments were spotted and retweeted by author J.K.Rowling, who wrote: “Welcome to our post-referendum, anti-elitist, in-touch-with-the-people politicians.”

In response, Mr Jackson told Peterborough Today: “I could not care less what JK Rowling thinks. It’s got nothing to do with her.

“There’s a campaign to de-legitimise the result which is the largest number of people voting for anything in British electoral history.

He added: “The point is there’s £350 million that has to be allocated to the EU. It’s up to the Government now - it might spend it on the NHS, adult social care, school places. We will have that choice to make.”

550,"1) Acquisition of Irish citizenship through descent, 2) marriage, or 3) ""citizenship by investment"" (basically buying your citizenship). ",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-eu-referendum-how-can-i-keep-my-eu-passport-travel-a7100091.html,"A passport from a European Union country confers the right to live and work in any other EU nation, and soon UK citizens will lose that right. After the Leave vote, some speculated that they could renew their passport immediately and remain a citizen of the EU for the next 10 years. That option will not work. Even though the cover of a British passport reads ""European Union"" at the top, when the UK leaves Europe, it ceases to be an EU passport.

Accordingly, many people will decide it is rational to seek an alternative passport. But how difficult is it?

The easiest route for some will be to acquire Irish citizenship through descent - a process that is straightforward if you have the good fortune to have an Irish parent. It doesn't matter if they were born in the Republic or Northern Ireland; it's the island of Ireland that counts.

The government in Dublin says: “If either of your parents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, then you are automatically an Irish citizen, irrespective of your place of birth. If you were born outside Ireland to an Irish citizen who was himself or herself born outside Ireland, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen.”

✕ David Cameron resigns as PM

Even if neither of your parents is an Irish citizen, you can go back another generation: to citizenship through descent from Irish grandparents.

The Irish government says if one of your grandparents is an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, you can have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register - and, “If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration.”

This lineage can continue through the generations: if you are (or become) an Irish citizen, this status can be passed on “by each generation ensuring their registration in the Foreign Births Register before the birth of the next generation”.

He is likely to reassure nationals of other EU countries living in the UK that their status is unchanged. That is what the Leave campaign has said, so, even after the Brexit negotiations are complete, those who are already in the UK would be allowed to stay Getty 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you Higher inflation A lower pound means that imports would become more expensive. This is likely to mean the return of inflation – a phenomenon with which many of us are unfamiliar because prices have been stable for so long, rising at no more than about 2 per cent a year. The effect may probably not be particularly noticeable in the first few months. At first price rises would be confined to imported goods – food and clothes being the most obvious – but inflation has a tendency to spread and to gain its own momentum AFP/Getty Images 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you Interest rates might rise The trouble with inflation is that the Bank of England has a legal obligation to keep it as close to 2 per cent a year as possible. If a fall in the pound threatens to push prices up faster than this, the Bank will raise interest rates. This acts against inflation in three ways. First, it makes the pound more attractive, because deposits in pounds will earn higher interest. Second, it reduces demand by putting up the cost of borrowing, and especially by taking larger mortgage payments out of the economy. Third, it makes it more expensive for businesses to borrow to expand output Getty 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you Did somebody say recession? Mr Carney, the Treasury and a range of international economists have warned about this. Many Leave voters appear not to have believed them, or to think that they are exaggerating small, long-term effects. But there is no doubt that the Leave vote is a negative shock to the economy. This is because it changes expectations about the economy’s future performance. Even though Britain is not actually be leaving the EU for at least two years, companies and investors will start to move money out of Britain, or to scale back plans for expansion, because they are less confident about what would happen after 2018 AFP/Getty Images 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you And we wouldn’t even get our money back All this will be happening while the Prime Minister, whoever he or she is, is negotiating the terms of our future access to the EU single market. In the meantime, our trade with the EU would be unaffected, except that companies elsewhere in the EU may be less interested in buying from us or selling to us, expecting tariff barriers to go up in two years’ time.

If your genes are geopolitically unhelpful, the next possible route to an EU passport is marriage. But don’t expect instant results. Each country makes its own rules on how long it takes to acquire citizenship, and they are generally designed to avoid marriages of convenience. For example, the spouse of a citizen of Malta can become a citizen of the island only after five years of wedded bliss.

The final option is open only to those with the right kind of bank balance: buying your way in to EU nationality, with a “citizenship by investment” scheme that many countries offer. According to KPMG, Cyprus is “the ‘jurisdiction of choice’ for many high net worth individuals and their families”. The price tag is investing €5m in the island.",2016-06-24 08:57:27
551,A startling number of sexual assaults were committed by serial rapists. ,http://www.attn.com/stories/8902/researchers-tested-backlogged-rape-kits-revealed-startling-truth-about-sexual-assault,"On Monday, researchers from Case Western University released the results of an investigation into backlogged rape kits in Ohio's Cuyahoga County. Included in the results are some noteworthy findings about the behaviors of serial rapists and one time offenders.

The data, which was reported by the Cut, revealed that a startling number of sexual assaults were committed by serial rapists.

According to the Cut, the Case Western study is related to a larger effort to process a huge backlog of rape kits in the Cleveland area. Researchers were able to look at 248 high priority rape case files, and found noteworthy differences between serial rapists and one time offenders.

""About a quarter of the serial offenders in this sample had previously been arrested for sexual assault, and 60 percent would have a subsequent sexual-assault arrest. The majority of both serial and onetime sexual offenders had a history of a felony-level arrest, but serial offenders' histories were more extensive and violent. Serial rapists were also more likely to kidnap their victims, commit the assault outdoors, and threaten victims with a weapon.

Case Western researchers also wrote in a brief that ""it is very likely that a sexual offender has either previously sexually assaulted or will offend again in the future.""

As result, they recommend authorities alter their approach to investigating rape cases.

""Investigating each sexual assault as possibly being perpetrated by a serial offender has the potential to reduce the number of sexual assaults if the focus of the investigation is more on the offender than on a single incident. Serial offenders have traditionally been investigated according to the consistency of the assault or the MO (e.g., who they assault, where they assault, how they assault). For example, our findings seem to suggest that MOs (while definitely important to track for investigative purposes, especially when DNA is present) are not a consistently reliable link across assaults and thus a missed opportunity to solve unsolved sexual assaults and an opportunity to prevent future offending.""

We don't know exactly how many untested rape kits are out there.

""We cannot be sure of the total number of untested kits nationwide because most jurisdictions do not have systems for tracking or counting rape kits,"" End the Backlog reports. ""Additionally, there is no federal law mandating a nationwide movement toward tracking and testing rape kits, despite efforts by some members of Congress to pass such legislation. However a growing number of states, all across the country, are making real reforms to end the backlog.""

In late May, the Senate unanimously voted to pass a bill that would grant rights to victims of sexual assault.

""The Senate measure would generally require that victims be notified of the results of rape kit tests, including any DNA matches, as well as toxicology reports that could show whether they had been given a date-rape drug, for instance,"" the New York Times reported.

""The bill would also ensure that rape kits would be preserved without charge for 20 years or until the statute of limitations expires, whichever comes first,"" the Times added.

Still, it's important to acknowledge that only a small fraction of victims of sexual assault report incidents to law enforcement.

Sixty-eight percent of sexual assault victims do not report incidents to the police, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN).

Not right away -- California grew just fine in the year the tax hikes took effect -- and especially not in the medium term, as new economic data showed this week.

Now, correlation does not, as they say, equal causation, and two examples are but a small sample. But the divergent experiences of California and Kansas run counter to a popular view, particularly among conservative economists, that tax cuts tend to supercharge growth and tax increases chill it.

California's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth of the year. That was up from 3.1 percent growth for the Golden State in 2014, which was near the top of the national pack.

The Kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015. That's down from 1.2 percent in 2014, and below neighboring states such as Nebraska (2.1 percent) and Missouri (1.2 percent). Kansas ended the year with two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- a shrinking economy. By a common definition of the term, the state entered 2016 in recession.

Other effects of the Kansas tax cuts, which were meant to spur entrepreneurship, are well-documented.

Story continues below advertisement

While state officials anticipated that the reductions would create a shortfall in the state budget, tax revenues have been consistently below even those expectations. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service have signaled that they could reduce Kansas’s credit rating, indicating there is a chance the state cannot pay its bills.

The shortfalls have forced Gov. Sam Brownback (R) and lawmakers to make additional adjustments. The state canceled the initial reduction in sales taxes, then increased them again, while delaying additional scheduled reductions in the income tax.

On the whole, Brownback’s policies modestly increased taxes for the poor and working class, who pay more in sales taxes than income taxes, while reducing taxes drastically for the rich.

The poorest 20 percent of households -- those making less than $23,000 a year -- are paying about $200 more, on average, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington. For the middle class, the changes have been a wash, with less-affluent households paying somewhat more and more-affluent households giving up a little less.

Meanwhile, the wealthiest 1 percent of households, those making at least $493,000 a year, are saving an average of $25,000.

Kansas’s gross domestic product is still less than it was at the end of 2011, said Menzie Chinn, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has been following Kansas’s economy. Meanwhile, the economy in the rest of the country continues to expand.

“It’s remarkable,” Chinn said.

It is perhaps less remarkable -- or surprising -- that California has powered along. The recovery nationwide has favored massive metropolitan areas stocked with high-skilled workers, which is to say places such as Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco. The damage from California's deep housing crash has slowly healed in places such as the Central Valley.

Still, the noncoastal regions of California lag far behind Silicon Valley and Los Angeles in their job and growth recoveries. The state's median income remains below pre-recession levels after adjustment for inflation, although it still beats the national average.

Few, if any, economists would say today that the recovery has been sufficient for all Californians. But almost no one can say that raising taxes on the rich killed that recovery. Or that given a choice of the two states' economic performances over the past few years, you'd rather be Kansas.",2016-06-23 11:00:00
553,Volunteers dressed as angels formed a human wall to separate the hateful Westboro Baptist Church from mourners at victims' funerals. ,http://www.bet.com/news/national/2016/06/19/anti-lgbt-protestors-at-funerals.html,"As many of the funerals for victims of the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando have begun, and the majority of the victims were LBGT men, it's no surprise that the notorious hate group, Westboro Baptist Church, made an appearance to protest by holding up their hateful signs and claiming that homosexuality is responsible for the evil in the world. But they weren't prepared for what they found when they arrived.

The protestors were blocked by volunteers who dressed up as angels, with huge white sheets held up from their shoulders to block the signs, and chants, from the Westboro Baptist Church protestors.

The ""Angel Action"" counter-protest can be traced back almost 30 years, to 1999, when WBC members picketed the funeral of Laramie, Wyoming gay teen, Matthew Shepard where friends of the murdered teen dressed up in similar outfits to block protestors at the murder trials of the two men responsible for his tragic death.

The angels at Saturday's funerals were members of the Orlando Shakespeare Theater, and their actions were met with hugs and tears from the grateful family and friends of those lost in the tragic shooting.

The chants of the WBC were also drowned out by the angelic volunteers singing ""Amazing Grace,"" in a beautiful and emotional sing of solidarity and support.",2016-06-23 10:00:00

Even though the holiday is a joyous occasion, I felt tears in my eyes as I recited our sacred prayers.

I had not been to a bar in more than 20 years. And I had never been to a gay bar. Someone in the congregation told me about a bar called the Fireplace, so I announced that as our destination. Afterward, I found out it was predominantly frequented by gay African Americans.

Approximately a dozen of us, wearing our kippot, or yarmulkes, went down as soon as the holiday ended. Some of the members of our group are gay, but most are not. We did not know what to expect. As we gathered outside, we saw one large, drunk man talking loudly and wildly. I wondered whether we were in the right place. Then my mother, who was with me, went up to a man who was standing on the side of the building. She told him why we were there. He broke down in tears and told us his cousin was killed at Pulse. He embraced us and invited us into the Fireplace.

We didn’t know what to expect, but it turned out that we had so much in common. We met everyone in the bar. One of the patrons told me that his stepchildren were actually bar-mitzvahed in our congregation. Another one asked for my card so that his church could come and visit. The bartender shut off all of the music in the room, and the crowd became silent as we offered words of prayer and healing. My co-clergy Maharat Ruth Friedman shared a blessing related to the holiday of Shavuot, and she lit memorial candles on the bar ledge. Then everyone in the bar put their hands around each other’s shoulders, and we sang soulful tunes. After that, one of our congregants bought a round of beer for the whole bar.

Everyone in the bar embraced each other. It was powerful and moving and real and raw.

After that we moved to the outdoor makeshift memorial service at Dupont Circle. There, too, we did not know what to expect. But as we gathered around the circle, people kept coming up to us and embracing us. One man we met there told us that his daughter sometimes prays with us. Others were visiting from Los Angeles but joined in full voice, clearly knowing the Hebrew words to the song we were singing.

As we were singing, I looked over at some gay members of our congregation and saw tears flowing down their faces. I felt the reality that we are living in a time of enormous pain. But I also felt that the night was a tremendous learning experience for me. I learned that when a rabbi and members of an Orthodox synagogue walk into a gay African American bar, it is not the opening line of a joke but an opportunity to connect; it is an opportunity to break down barriers and come together as one; it is an opportunity to learn that if we are going to survive, we all need each other.

557,Not really. ,http://www.npr.org/2016/06/15/482113672/are-gop-women-warming-up-to-trump,"Are GOP Women Warming Up To Donald Trump?

Enlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR

It's no secret that Donald Trump has struggled to win over female voters. Polls show more than 60 percent of women have an unfavorable opinion of the presumptive Republican nominee.

But, as the campaign pivots to the general election, are Republican women reconsidering Trump? It's this group of largely white women Trump needs in November.

In the key battleground state of Ohio, there are plenty of women who adore Trump — and plenty of women who despise him. But many Republican women seem to be somewhere in the middle. They may not like Trump's tone, but they're willing to vote for him, or willing to be persuaded.

""He is a rough talker, but it's not a big deal. Everybody seems so thin-skinned,"" says Diana Forrester, a longtime Republican voter. ""He's raised some wonderful children, and that tells you a lot about a person.""

Outside of her suburban Columbus house, Forrester flies an American flag. Inside, she has pictures of her family — including her son, a National Guardsman who was killed four years ago in Afghanistan by a suicide bomber.

""I don't believe we can continue to go in the direction we're going. We've got to change our direction,"" Forrester explains over chicken sandwiches and fruit on a hot summer day at her house.

She's upset by President Obama's leadership and his desire to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay.

""Why are we arguing about bathrooms?"" she asks, referencing the debate around transgender bills. ""It makes no sense to me. It's like everyone's gone crazy. ... Our sons and daughters are being killed on foreign soil, and we're worrying about bathrooms?""

Forrester says the Orlando shooting proves, once again, that even on U.S. soil, Americans are not safe.

""You can't send a child to school and be certain they will come home safe. You can't go to a restaurant and be sure you won't be shot over your soup,"" she says.

National security is her main concern, and she thinks Trump is the best candidate to protect the country. But Ohio is a place where security moms meet Midwestern manners, and Trump's tactics and tone ruffle a lot of feathers.

""I don't know how he's going to mend fences with women in general,"" says state Rep. Barbara Sears, who described Trump's attitude as ""condescending and simplistic.""

Sears is a delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich at the Republican National Convention this summer. She was a loyal Kasich supporter, and campaigned for him across five different states when he was running for president.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR

But now that Kasich is out of the running, she plans to support Trump — it's a matter of pragmatism and party loyalty, she says.

""Philosophically I'm a Republican, lean more toward the conservative side, and so the idea of moving away from some semblance of a conservative side would just not be acceptable to me,"" she explains. ""So, yes, I'll support Donald Trump ... and rally behind that, because that's the philosophy I want guiding the ship down in D.C.""

But does she like Trump?

""I'm still trying to decide whether I like him or not, but I don't know whether I have to like the president. I have to respect the president's ability to lead the country, right? I don't have to be overly excited about the idea of having a cup of coffee with him,"" she says.

At a park in a wealthy suburb just outside Columbus, moms in sun hats watch their kids in bathing suits splash through water fountains. It's the kind of park where you see Muslim, Latino and black families — and Kasich-style Republicans, like Rachel Pugar, 29.

""We're not thrilled with Donald Trump,"" she says with a laugh, nodding to her husband, who stands nearby in a pair of scrubs watching their daughter.

Pugar says they supported Kasich in the primaries and worry that Trump doesn't understand foreign policy.

""I think he's a little bit dangerous,"" she says. ""I don't like the way he talks about women and minorities. ... He just doesn't seem like a very stable candidate.""

But come Election Day, she says, she will probably still vote for him ""because we dislike Hillary even more.""

NPR spoke to about two-dozen Republican women from Columbus to Cleveland for this story, and many of them said they would vote for Trump even if they don't like his tone or his character.

But a few women were adamant that Trump is a choice they cannot accept. So, they say, they simply will not vote for president this November; they insist they'll vote for down-ballot elections, but they'll leave the top of the ticket blank.

""He's just so liberal to me, so liberal,"" says Sandy Nowak, who voted for Ted Cruz in the primary.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR

Nowak worries that Trump is not a true conservative.

""I just feel like I can't, in good faith, go vote for him and then sit back with a good conscience,"" she says. ""I don't necessarily trust him as a person. ... I feel like if we get him, we're saying goodbye to the Republican Party as we've known it.

Her best friend, Tamara Frazier, seems a little more open to persuasion.

""I'm willing to sit back and listen and see what he does over the next few months,"" she says. ""I'm still expecting him to be Donald Trump. I'm sure he's going to say things that just make me go, 'Oh!' ""

Frazier says some days she's optimistic that Trump is heading in the right direction.

""A lot of times he's on late-night talk shows, and he's being very calm and reasonable, and I'm sitting there going, 'OK, it's possible he could have good manners,' "" she says.

But then, she says, she's reminded of the insults he's hurled at women, mainly because of an ad she's seen on TV that she can't get out of her mind; it's an anti-Trump ad made by a superPAC supporting Hillary Clinton, in which women wearing Trump T-shirts mouth Trump's own words regarding women.

""They're hitting everything from short women to Megyn Kelly. ... I'm not kidding, every time ... that crazy commercial comes on, it puts me in the worst mood toward him,"" she says.

The problem for Trump is that Democrats already have a built-in advantage with women. So, he can't afford to have a Republican woman like Frazier sitting on the sidelines.",2016-06-15 15:24:18

",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/6/9/1536703/-A-USA-Today-Investigation-That-Should-Surprise-Nobody,"USA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn’t pay his bills

""During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah's at Trump Plaza.

""The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder. ""Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. “That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company… which has been around since my grandfather,” he said.

""Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will ""protect your job."" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades – and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.

""At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.

""Trump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.

""In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens – filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work – since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.

""The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.""",2016-06-10 09:00:00

Sunny and windy weather lit up the country's solar and wind farms, causing a surge of clean energy that amounted to almost all of Germany’s 45.8 gigawatt daily demand. Topped up by the supply from traditional power plants, the sum of energy being produced that day was well in excess of the amount needed.

And that means that for a brief moment in time, energy prices were negative: consumers were effectively being paid to use energy.

The below chart shows Germany's power production and consumption on 8 May 2016: you can see the gigawatts peaking between 10am and 12am.

Germany isn’t the only country living the green dream: for four consecutive days last month, Portugal managed to run entirely on wind, solar and hydro power. It’s a bright point in a generally cheery picture for Portugal, with renewable sources now providing almost half its energy each year.

Sixteen countries have now hit 100% renewable electricity production, according to 2013 data from the Energy Information Administration. Costa Rica made headlines recently by running entirely on clean energy for 75 days of 2015.

But for the fields of psychology, sociology and economics, it has been a gold mine, too. The sudden change in fortunes has offered a rare glimpse into the subtle but important ways in which money can alter a child’s life. The dataset is so rich that researchers continue to study it to this day.

""It would be almost impossible to replicate this kind of longitudinal study,” said Randall Akee, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the impact of changes in household income. “Especially for a sample this large. This is the sort of circumstance you dream of as a researcher.""

Seizing the opportunity, Akee, along with a team of other researchers, recently revisited the data to analyze each child’s personality both in the years before the casino was built and in those after.

As part of the original study, the children and parents were asked a series of questions, designed to measure, among other things, a number of personality traits. The same questions were posed every other year, for a decade. Akee's goal was to observe any changes—positive or negative—resulting from the extra household income. Their findings, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research last month, are nothing short of remarkable.

""This was hugely important to the development of the children, to their wellbeing” said Akee. ""And the effect wasn’t small either—it was actually fairly large.""

Not only did the extra income appear to lower the instance of behavioral and emotional disorders among the children, but, perhaps even more important, it also boosted two key personality traits that tend to go hand in hand with long-term positive life outcomes.

The first is conscientiousness. People who lack it tend to lie, break rules and have trouble paying attention. The second is agreeableness, which leads to a comfort around people and aptness for teamwork. And both are strongly correlated with various forms of later life success and happiness.

Story continues below advertisement

The researchers also observed a slight uptick in neuroticism, which, they explained, is a good sign. Neuroticism is generally considered to be a positive trait so long as one does not have too much of it.

""We're talking about all sorts of good, positive, long-term things,"" said Emilia Simeonova, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies the economics of health, and one of the paper's co-authors. ""There are very powerful correlations between conscientiousness and agreeableness and the ability to hold a job, to maintain a steady relationship. The two allow for people to succeed socially and professionally.""

Remarkably, the change was the most pronounced in the children who were the most deficient. ""This actually reduces inequality with respect to personality traits,"" said Akee. ""On average, everyone is benefiting, but in particular it's helping the people who need it the most.""

Story continues below advertisement

Why exactly this happened with the children neither Akee nor any of his co-researchers can say with absolute certainty. Not even Jane Costello, a professor at Duke University who was part of the team that initiated the original study and co-authored the recent paper can say. But they have a few ideas, based on observable changes in the families after the casino was built and the extra money started to flow in.

They know, based on the interviews with parents, that the relationship between spouses tended to improve as a result. They also know that the relationship between the parents and their children tended to improve. And they know that parents tended to drink less alcohol.

""There is a lot of literature that shows in order to change outcomes among children you are best off treating the parents first,"" said Simeonova. ""And these are really clear changes in the parents.""

Story continues below advertisement

There's also the question of stress, which the extra money helps relieve—even if only a little. While the added income wasn't enough to allow parents to quit their jobs, it's a base level that helped with rent and food and other basic expenses. That, Akee said, is powerful enough itself.

""We know that the thing poor couples fight about the most is money,"" he said. ""Off the bat, this means a more harmonious family environment.""

And some of the families, given the boost, even moved to areas with slightly better census tracts in terms of both income and education. They were, in other words, able to expose their children to a different group of peers.

Story continues below advertisement

For the most part, scientists agree that the window for improvement in a child's cognitive abilities is short-lived. By the age of about 8, children have set themselves on a path, Akee said. What comes next happens, more or less, within the confines of the limits that were created in their early years.

One's personality, on the other hand, is malleable well into adolescence. What's more, the changes tend to be fairly permanent.

""All of the evidence points to the idea if they change in the teenage years, they will stay changed forever,"" said Akee. ""In this case, the kids will likely maintain a different level of conscientiousness and agreeableness for life.""

Experts have known about the power of intervention for some time. A lot of previous research has shown that educational interventions can have sizable impacts on personality traits and, in turn, life outcomes. But rarely, if ever before, have researchers been able to observe the impact of a change in income across such a large group.

The takeaway isn't that casinos are inherently benevolent institutions. But rather that money—even modest sums—can be a pretty powerful thing. And for reasons most would likely overlook.",2016-06-10 07:30:00

Priyanka Parashar/Mint via Getty Images

The House passed a bill on Wednesday that would delay the Environmental Protection Agency’s new ozone regulations for perhaps another decade -- a move that could endanger the health of millions of Americans.

The EPA’s October 2015 regulations lowered the limit for ground-level ozone pollution -- otherwise known as smog, which forms when nitrogen oxide reacts with volatile organic compounds in the air. The rules had been in the works for seven years, and even the updated standard was not low enough to please a number of public health and environmental groups.

But business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argue that the new standard is too strict and will hurt industry. They scored a win with the House bill, sponsored by Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas), which would push back implementation of the rules by 10 years.

Olson said in a statement that the bill is simply a “common sense"" effort to provide “needed flexibility so that states and localities can adequately achieve new, lower standards with time for compliance.”

Business advocates are understandably pleased. “Manufacturers are encouraged to see House leaders pursue much-needed legislation to reduce the burdens and inflexibilities associated with the 2015 ozone standards,” said Ross Eisenberg, NAM's vice president of energy and resources policy, in a statement.

But environmental, science and health advocacy groups contend that such a delay would increase dangerous air pollution. On June 7, 116 organizations signed a letter warning that the bill ""could well result in communities being exposed to unhealthy levels of smog and soot and sulfur dioxide and even toxic lead pollution.""

The White House has made it clear that President Barack Obama would veto the bill if it passed the Senate, releasing a statement on Tuesday that said it “would jeopardize progress toward cleaner air and significantly delay health benefits worth billions of dollars for millions of Americans.”

Ozone pollution can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, including asthma attacks, wheezing and increased risk of stroke and early death, according to the American Lung Association. The dangers are considered even greater for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and people with pre-existing lung and heart conditions.",2016-06-10 06:33:45

Turner was convicted in March on three felony counts of sexual assault.

According to Turner's inmate details, which are available to the public, he will be released on Sept. 2, 2016.

County of Santa Clara

Public Information Officer Sgt. James Jensen, from the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office, said over the phone the date that appears on the site is indeed when the court has instructed officials to release Turner, although he could not say that the sentence has been formally shortened.

When asked if it's possible that the release date suggests Brock may be moved to another corrections facility, Jensen said, ""That would not be a possibility.""

""If it says he's getting released on that date — unless there's some special circumstance and he receives new criminal charges while in prison and were to be charged — that is the date of his release,"" said Jensen.

An unnamed representative from the same sheriff's office told TMZ that Turner is being held in ""protective custody"" away from any inmates who aren't also in protective custody, and will have an escort who will accompany him on prison grounds.

According to the representative, Turner was eligible to receive these protections by virtue of him serving time for sexual assault and ""those type of inmates are often targeted,"" wrote TMZ staff.

Opinion polls suggest the public is split down the middle. The referendum on June 23 is too close to call.

Those in favor of walking out of the EU -- the Brexit option -- say European rules stifle U.K. business and leaving would boost the economy. They also say Britain would regain control of its borders and be able to limit immigration.

Those campaigning for the U.K. to stay -- including the government -- paint a much grimmer picture of life outside the EU. They say trade and investment would suffer, triggering a recession, killing jobs, slamming the pound and causing house prices to fall.

The referendum is the biggest decision Brits have faced in a generation. The last direct vote on the country's ties with Europe was in 1975.

A win for Brexit would shape the future of the U.K. and Europe for decades to come. The big problem is that nobody knows exactly how.

Government crisis?

Prime Minister David Cameron would face huge pressure to resign. He is campaigning for Britain to stay in the bloc, but his Conservative party (and government) is bitterly divided over the issue.

Fellow Conservative and former London mayor Boris Johnson leads the Brexit campaign and may be a candidate to succeed Cameron.

Whoever leads the government, he or she would eventually have to give formal notice to the other 27 EU countries of the U.K.'s intention to quit.

There is no deadline for that to happen, but once it does there is no turning back. The U.K. would then have two years to negotiate its divorce from the EU -- including the terms of trade with its 440 million remaining consumers.

They're worried about the impact on trade. By leaving, Britain would lose its automatic right to trade freely with the rest of the EU, which currently buys about 45% of British exports. The EU is an even bigger market for British services, such as banking and insurance.

On the other side, ""Brexiteers"" say the government could negotiate a new free trade agreement. But no country outside the EU has been able to secure that kind of privileged access to European markets without agreeing to pay into the EU budget or to accept free movement of citizens -- principles rejected by the Brexit campaign.

Investment and employment may also suffer. Many U.S. companies are heavily invested in Britain and use it as a gateway to the rest of Europe. So they may scale back in the U.K.

Other EU countries poured £496 billion ($708 billion) into Britain in 2014 -- almost half of all foreign investment. Those campaigning to remain in the EU say the flow of money could fall if the U.K. severs its links with the bloc. Many companies sell goods from their U.K. factories to other EU countries, and Brexit would make that harder.

A recent survey by professional services firm EY found that 72% of global companies see access to Europe as a key factor in deciding where to put their money. Nearly a third intended to either freeze or reduce their investment in the U.K. until the result of the referendum is known. Real estate investment has already been hit hard.

World leaders: Brexit is a 'serious risk to growth'

U.K. officials have said that up to 820,000 jobs could be lost if Britain leaves the EU. Several global companies have hinted they might shift jobs out of the U.K. The latest warning came from JPMorgan (JPM) last week.

Some Brexit campaigners have acknowledged that a vote to quit the EU could initially cost Britain jobs.

What happens to millions of migrants?

Migration is another hot topic. One of the core principles of the EU is the free movement of people, which gives citizens of any member state the right to live and work in any of the 28 countries in the union.

Those in favor of Brexit say leaving the bloc would allow the U.K. to decide which migrants to let in.

But an exit from the EU would raise questions about the status of roughly 3 million people from other EU states who currently live in the U.K. Campaigners say they would be allowed to stay, but future EU migrants would likely need a visa.

Brexit would also impact the roughly 1.2 million Brits living in other EU countries, as they could lose their right to travel around freely and access benefits such as healthcare.

Brexit: The big numbers you need to know

The domino effect?

A British vote to leave the EU could be the start of turbulent times for Europe. The EU is grappling with the world's worst refugee crisis in 70 years, and populist parties are gaining strength. The economy remains weak and unemployment high.

Support for the EU is falling sharply. A Pew Research Center study this week found that 47% of people in 10 member countries have an unfavorable opinion of the EU.

EU leaders are worried that if Britain decides to leave, other countries could follow. That could lead to a gradual unraveling of the EU, with huge consequences for the global economy, security and stability.

A more immediate threat is the risk that the United Kingdom could break apart. Leaders of the Scottish National Party have said they would seek a new referendum on Scotland's independence if Britain votes to leave the EU.

Scots are expected to vote in favor of keeping the U.K. in the EU.",2016-06-09 08:51:41
566,"Underwater volcanoes create massive carbon dioxide buildups in the lake - when the giant ""bubble"" is burst by an earthquake or a storm, the gas kills neighboring life. ",http://www.ozy.com/flashback/exploding-killer-lakes/65346,"A giant cloud of carbon dioxide bubbled up from Lake Nyos in northwestern Cameroon near the border of Nigeria on August 21, 1986, flowing into the valley below. It stripped the air of oxygen, suffocating 1,746 villagers and 3,000 animals to death.

This may sound like a scary movie plot, but for the thousands affected, it was a very real nightmare. A hydrovolcanic eruption 400 years earlier created a crater in the lake, where massive amounts of carbon dioxide built up over the centuries. Volcanic rumblings continued miles below the surface, with gas seeping into the groundwater to create “CO 2 -charged soda springs” that bled into the lake, says Dr. George Kling, a biologist at the University of Michigan.

When that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke.

The problem with CO 2 is that it builds up, “like in a soda bottle,” Kling says. No one can see the pressure building as long as the cap — in this case, the weight of the water — stays put and forces the gas to dissolve or be submerged. But when that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke, with bubbles rising to the surface and a giant burst of CO 2 escaping into the atmosphere.

Triggering the pressure’s release can be as simple as heavy rain or an earthquake. In Nyos, some boulders and dirt were the likely culprits, and Kling says he found evidence of a “very large and recent landslide” when he visited after the disaster. Dr. Njilah Isaac Konfor, a disaster-management and groundwater expert at the University of Yaounde in Cameroon, says there were reports of a week of rain before the event.

Luckily, there are just three known lakes worldwide with these properties, and only two of these limnic eruptions have occurred in recorded history. The first was a much smaller explosion at Lake Monoun, also in Cameroon, that killed 37. It took place two years earlier, almost to the day, just 19 miles away from Lake Nyos. Volcanologists and engineers, Kling says, have been working to eliminate the CO 2 risk there ever since via six-inch pipes that pump out the gas.

While “unlikely,” according to Dr. Greg Tanyileke of the Cameroonian Institute for Geological and Mining Research and the chief government scientist working on the lake, Lake Nyos could suffer another deadly eruption. Warding off such a calamity is an ongoing process, he says. Kling adds that, despite efforts to warn locals and help them make “informed choices,” many have returned to their homes and farmland because the soil there is so fertile, and farming is critical to their rural existence.

But CO 2 isn’t the only problem. There’s also a rickety natural dam made of volcanic ash and rock at one part of the crater. If it collapses, the top 130 feet of the lake could come crashing down, causing a flood that “would reach Nigeria” and endanger 5,000 people, Kling says. Even worse, this could cause another imbalance in the lake and possibly unleash any remaining carbon dioxide still suppressed at the bottom. This “double-whammy threat,” as Kling calls it, is being addressed by an expensive but essential dam-strengthening project that is nearing completion.



Even if Cameroon’s lakes are no longer a threat, scientists have their eyes on a far bigger lake in Central Africa with similar attributes. Lake Kivu, which lies on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, is 1,600 times larger than Nyos and contains 1,000 times more gas. It also sits on the Albertine Rift, where it is enduring increasing volcanic activity. This, combined with the fact that it has gas levels high enough to kill two million people along its shores if there’s a limnic eruption, makes it what Kling calls the “largest ticking time bomb in the world.”

And scientists haven’t settled on what can be done to avert the danger. The lake is so big that the methods used to degas Cameroon’s bodies of water simply won’t work. Instead, the Rwandan government is trying to prevent a disaster and capitalize on the natural gas — the fifth largest methane deposit in the world — by carefully harvesting the deposits for electricity. But until this project is done on a larger scale, another disaster like the one at Nyos remains possible.",2016-06-08 13:06:07
567,"About $420,000. ",http://hellogiggles.com/chewbacca-mom-has-lots-o-money/,"Here's how much money Chewbacca Mom has made since her video went viral

One day, Candace Payne was just a regular cool mom, sitting in her car after a shopping trip to Kohl’s, and decided to try out the talking Chewbacca mask she had just bought. The next day, she was the biggest star on the internet.

Literally overnight, her simple Chewbacca mask video went completely viral, and now it is the most-watched live video on Facebook ever. Since then, she’s joined James Corden on his way to work; appeared on Good Morning America; and even took a trip to Disney World. These spoils are the same equivalent of what Luke Skywalker got after he blew up Death Star.

We can’t exactly put a price on that cool medal Leia hangs around Luke’s neck, but we can put a price on everything that Payne, a mother of two Star Wars loving kids, has received over the last week. Money went ahead and tallied up the actual $$$ that Payne has received since her video hit the internet…and it’s a lot. It’s almost enough to buy her own Death Star.

According to Money, the grand total is roughly $420,000.

Money breaks down the amount like this: $3,000 in gift cards from Kohl’s +$5,000 travel expenses for talk shows + $2,500 gift card from Hasbro + $7,500 Disney World vacation for the family + $2,000 for the VIP treatment at Fan Expo Dallas + $400,000 in college scholarships for her family.

That’s a whole lot of money. It’s just under half a million dollars, and it all came out of posting a 4-minute video where she laughs in her car over a CHEWBACCA MASK. Clearly, this wookiee is winning.",2016-06-06 17:13:00
568,Women's shelters in El Salvador. ,https://www.buzzfeed.com/karlazabludovsky/this-is-where-women-are-seeking-peace-in-the-worlds-most-vio?utm_term=.paEjzVymQ#.etpGyq36j,"When Idalia, 37, decided she would defy his orders, her husband hired a hitman to kill her. Luckily for her, the assassin was himself thrown in jail before he could carry out the hit. Desperate to find out what was going on, Idalia went to visit her would-be killer in prison and found out how much her husband had paid to get rid of her. “$10,000. That’s it,” she said in disbelief, crying quietly.

In El Salvador, where warring gangs have unleashed an unprecedented bloodbath, turning it into the country with the highest murder rate in the world, women’s lives are almost worthless. “Men continue thinking they own women,” said Alba Evelyn Cortez, a consultant on gender issues at El Salvador’s legislative assembly.

It is, frankly, terrifying to be a woman in El Salvador. The staunchly Catholic country of six million on the Pacific coast of the Central American isthmus is one of the most machista and patriarchal in the region.

Systematically beaten, raped, and killed in a country that has rarely held their aggressors accountable, women have become even more vulnerable since a government-brokered truce between the country’s two main gangs collapsed in 2014, experts and activists say. In 2012, when the truce was signed, homicides dropped by 60% from the previous year, but last year they shot up past pre-truce levels: There were 6,653 homicides — an average of 18 per week, or 115 for every 100,000 people.

This violence has spilled from the street into people's homes. “Gang members are at the center of families,” said Silvia Juárez, of the Organization of Salvadoran Women for Peace, or ORMUSA, a nonprofit. “The violence that women in El Salvador face is more lethal now.”

Femicides, or the killing of women because of their gender, have been on the rise in recent years. In 2014, there were 183 cases of femicide, up from 98 the previous year, though the numbers are believed to be significantly underreported. But it’s not just femicides: The rate at which women are being killed is rising faster than men. Last year, women made up 8.6% of all homicides, up from 7.5% the previous year, according to the Institute of Legal Medicine.

Despite this, there are few resources available for women who suffer domestic violence. The Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women, a government agency, has just one overnight shelter for victims of domestic violence, making it impossible for most women to reach.

In recent years, however, a glimmer of hope has emerged in the figure of the former first lady, Vanda Pignato. She has led a campaign to bring women's rights into the mainstream, and has built six centers — known as Ciudad Mujer (or Women's City) — around the country, offering women a place where they can seek help. And most importantly, they can do so anonymously — essential in a country where speaking out against your male abusers can be fatal.",2016-06-06 13:59:22
569,Oregano. ,http://grist.org/food/this-herb-could-be-the-secret-to-curbing-cows-climate-changing-burps/,"Oregano may seem like an unlikely ingredient in the fight against climate change. But this modest herb could make cows’ methane-heavy belches — a big contributor to the warming of our planet — a little less potent.

Oregano’s essential oil contains carvacrol, an antimicrobial that kills off some of the methane-producing bacteria in the cow’s rumen. Danish researchers who are investigating oregano’s methane-suppressing abilities hope that it could reduce cows’ methane emissions by a quarter. Nearly 15 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to livestock, and 65 percent of that total comes from raising beef and dairy cattle.

NPR points out that oregano oil isn’t the only solution to cutting down cows’ ballooning emissions. Scientists have explored unpronounceable alternatives like 3-nitrooxypopanal, a methane-inhibiting chemical. But those may not be compatible with organic guidelines, and many of the people who care about cows’ methane emissions are the same ones who buy organic milk.

We could just eat less dairy and beef. But while some Americans are starting to shift away from meat, that change may not happen soon enough. It might behoove us to get our cows chewing oregano cud, since that could be one small solution we could implement fast.",2016-06-02 15:30:00
570,Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. ,http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/pcos-this-woman-was-told-to-lose-weight-by-doctors-but-something-else-was-going-on-a7033141.html,"To Deborah E. Savage, a trip to the doctor was frequently an exercise in humiliation.

For more than 15 years, Savage's doctors doled out the same advice: You need to stop gaining weight. When Savage replied that she had tried watching her diet and exercising, only to pack on more pounds, it was clear they simply didn't believe her. Her family was equally skeptical.

""I would eat like my sister, and I would gain weight but she wouldn't,"" recalled Savage, a civil engineer who lives in Montgomery County and turns 31 next month.

Savage's inexorable weight gain, which began in middle school and resulted in obesity, was not her only problem: For years, she also struggled with eruptions of painful acne and facial hair. ""These things made me feel ugly,"" she said.

Last year, after Savage had trouble getting pregnant, an inability she suspected was linked to her irregular periods, she consulted a new obstetrician/gynecologist. The doctor suggested that Savage's constellation of problems might have a single cause. But it took a second OB/GYN to conduct the proper tests, which led to a definitive diagnosis of a common -- and consequential -- disorder.

""It's frustrating to me that so many doctors"" didn't think of this, she said. ""If I'd known, I would have made changes years ago.""

From the time she was 12, Savage recalled, her inability to lose weight became one of the defining elements of her life. And because she is short -- 5-foot-3 -- extra pounds were particularly noticeable. Her family's comparisons with her older, thinner sister rankled.

At her mother's suggestion, Savage joined a gym, but that didn't help her lose more than a few pounds.

Savage said she was too intimidated to ask her doctors why her weight didn't budge much, even when she faithfully followed a diet and worked out.

Nor did she mention the other problems that plagued her. ""The facial hair thing was embarrassing, so I didn't want to talk about it,"" she recalled. ""Same with the acne. I felt so sensitive about it.""

Savage wasn't sure what to make of her irregular menstrual periods, but doctors did not seem concerned. At times she went three months without a period; at other times they lasted for two weeks. She managed to lose a little weight in college, but her acne and other problems persisted.

✕ What if men had periods?

In her early 20s, Savage said, her gynecologist chided her about how heavy she was; every year, she seemed to gain 10 pounds. ""I explained that I had tried diet and exercise, but he said I was not trying hard enough,"" Savage recalled.

To regulate her menstrual cycle and tame her acne, the doctor prescribed oral contraceptives, which helped clear her skin and made her periods somewhat less irregular.

When she got married in 2010, Savage and her husband joined a popular weight-loss program to see whether they could motivate each other.

Savage said she lost only about eight pounds after several months, while her husband, who followed the same diet, had no trouble shedding much more weight.

""It was very frustrating,"" she recalled. ""I was serious about following the rules, but it didn't pay off. I kind of gave up.""

By early 2015, she was desperate. She had stopped taking the pill nearly a year earlier, in hopes of getting pregnant; without it, her acne had roared back and her facial-hair problem had worsened. Savage was at her heaviest weight -- about 240 pounds -- and her family doctor warned that her cholesterol, at 210 mg/dL, was too high.

In March, she switched gynecologists. Her new doctor zeroed in on her irregular periods and her weight and asked Savage whether she had heard of a metabolic disorder called polycystic ovarian (or ovary) syndrome.

Savage replied that a friend in college had been diagnosed with PCOS. She was surprised when the doctor responded that she suspected Savage might have it, too.

An explanation at last

PCOS is a common hormonal imbalance that often begins in puberty and affects as many as 10 percent of women. Its cause is unknown, but heredity appears to play a role: Women whose mothers or sisters have the disorder are at higher risk. Many women with PCOS have enlarged ovaries containing fluid-filled cysts that produce excess androgens -- male sex hormones, which interfere with ovulation. Other signs of PCOS include irregular, absent or prolonged periods, acne and excess facial and body hair, a condition known as hirsutism.

Because it also disrupts the regulation of insulin, many women with PCOS are overweight or obese. The disorder, which can be controlled but not cured, also increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart attack.

The gynecologist told Savage that she also suffered from PCOS. When Savage asked whether it was possible to test for the disorder, she said that the gynecologist told her, erroneously, that there were no tests. The best way to treat the problem was to lose weight, the doctor advised. And, the gynecologist added, she held weight-loss seminars in her office and urged Savage to sign up.

Savage declined. Two weeks later, she consulted a third OB/GYN, Neil Horlick, who practices in Montgomery and Frederick counties.

Horlick, after taking her history and performing an exam, said he suspected she had PCOS. When Savage told him she had been told there was no test for it, he assured her that testing was available and that he would order it.

Because abnormalities of the thyroid or adrenal glands can cause similar symptoms, those must be ruled out first. PCOS is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion, made on the basis of blood tests, a patient's symptoms and an ultrasound of the ovaries.

""We generally look for two out of three criteria for PCOS,"" Horlick said. These include a history of irregular or absent periods, elevated levels of male hormones, particularly testosterone, and the presence of ovarian cysts. In Savage's case, an ultrasound showed no cysts, but she did have an elevated testosterone level.

Horlick said he was surprised that Savage's condition went undiagnosed for so long. ""PCOS is always on our radar"" when a patient with irregular periods complains of weight gain and hirsutism, Horlick said.

He told Savage that her best chance of getting pregnant involved losing weight. Horlick prescribed metformin, a diabetes drug that can promote weight loss. Metformin is commonly given to PCOS patients and may help promote ovulation as well.

Savage decided to take a new approach to food. She began following a paleo diet, which emphasizes meat, vegetables, nuts and fruit, and drastically reduces the intake of carbohydrates, sugar and processed foods.

The first month, she said, she was elated to discover that she had lost 15 pounds; between April and September, she shed 50 pounds and her cholesterol dropped 20 points. Her acne also improved, her level of testosterone dropped, and her menstrual cycle became more regular.

Savage said she asked relatives whether anyone else had been diagnosed with PCOS. ""My parents had never heard of it,"" she said.

In October 2015, she and her husband were elated to learn that she was pregnant with identical twin boys. Savage spent six weeks hospitalized at Maryland's Shady Grove Medical Center under close observation, because her twins have a rare condition in which they share a single amniotic sac and placenta, a condition unrelated to PCOS.

",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/17/cheese-america-surplus-donation,"As if we didn’t already have enough to worry about, what with the never-ending wars, economic inequality, prejudice, and the latest Drake album being very underwhelming to be perfectly honest, now I find out we have too much cheese.

According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, the United States has an overwhelming surplus of cheese, enough to equal three extra pounds of the stuff for every person in the country. If that’s really the case, then I eagerly await my share of this glorious bounty. Just ship it over in some dry ice, Obama. This hot tub I just installed in my back yard will make an excellent fondue pot.

The unfortunate dark side of this situation is that the overproduction of cheese by dairy farmers has tanked the price of their number one product, costing the industry millions of dollars in lost revenue. Michigan dairy farmer Carla Wardin told the Journal that her colleagues plan to deal with the situation by “do[ing] the same thing … you milk more cows”.

If dairy farmers refuse to stop making cheese, I suppose the only solution to this problem is to quickly, efficiently dispose of the cheese surplus. How are we going to do that? Glad you asked, because I have a few brilliant solutions. In fact, these are so clever that you might as well start calling me the Elon Musk of dairy products:

Donate the cheese to the hungry

According to the United Nations World Food Programme, 795 million people on the planet don’t have enough food to lead a healthy life. That’s about two and a half times the population of the US, but there’s enough surplus cheese here to give each of those hungry people 1.5 pounds. Even though cheese is not particularly healthy, and some people are lactose intolerant, some cheese is still better than no cheese, which also happens to be my rule at cocktail parties during the passed appetizer period.

All the extra cheese would be gone, dairy farmers could milk cows as much as they pleased, the price of cheese would soar, and the world’s starving masses would be able to enjoy a spot of brie that pairs excellently with a glass of pinot noir. There are no losers here.



Of course, that’s not what will happen. Here are scenarios far more likely than an act of kindness by the dairy industry:

Dump the cheese in the ocean

There’s already an island of trash in the middle of the Pacific Ocean the size of the state of Texas that no one seems to be bothered by, though there’s a decent chance that if Donald Trump finds out about it, he’ll promise to drop a nuke on it.

Besides the horrific effect a pile of garbage has on our marine ecosystem, it’s also not at all edible. You can’t eat an island of refuse, but you certainly can eat a large, floating mound of cheese. It’ll be a great place for cruise ships to stop for a cheesy photo opp. Plus, you can take a hunk of it home, like the Berlin Wall – at least until the whole thing melts and kills all the fish. But hey, think about what that will do to the price of fish! Cash those checks now, folks.

Bake the world’s largest pizza

We haven’t sent an astronaut to the moon in decades. Infrastructure projects that used to thrill the human imagination are now seen as major inconveniences at best, and at worst, blatant government overreach. New skyscraper height records are met with the sort of shrug usually reserved for the newest Katherine Heigl movie.

It’s time to inspire this great nation again. The only thing I can think of that really excites Americans is pizza. Every time I’ve seen a mega-pizza delivered to a home or a place of business, people gather around and poke at it with a stick like the monkeys from the beginning of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Pizza is the real final frontier, so let’s take that cheese and bake the largest pizza of all time.

The Guinness Book of World Records states that the biggest pie of all time was baked in Italy in December of 2012 by a man named Dovilio Nardi. It was 1,261.5 square meters – 13,580ft to us Yanks. That this pizza holds the record is shameful.

First of all, it’s gluten-free. Second, there’s no pepperoni, no mushrooms and no buffalo chicken – no toppings at all. But the most heinous crime is that the crust is not stuffed. If America made a giant pizza, you’d better believe that we would stuff the hell out of that crust. There’d be cheese, bacon, sausage, ranch dressing and if you’re lucky, a 2016 Chevy Malibu free to whomever is able to eat their way to it first.

Erect cheese sculptures in every city

If our current reevaluation of former presidents like Woodrow Wilson and Andrew Jackson are any indication, it is inevitable that every great American we revere now will eventually be found out as a murderer, a sadist or a racist. Why bother going through the tedious process of removing their names from buildings, taking them off currency or tearing down their statues? Why not just henceforth make each monument out of cheese? That way, they eventually rot and we have to toss them in a dumpster to get rid of the awful, awful smell of old gruyere. By the time the revelations of anti-social behavior come out, the cheese monument will be long gone.

Shoot it all into the sun with a rocket

This would be similar to the scene in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, when Superman collects all the nuclear weapons on the planet and hurls them into the sun to avert a global holocaust. Except it’s cheese.

Put it on the moon

In the same vein as the Superman IV solution, I propose we leave the cheese on the moon. It will probably be just fine sitting up there with no oxygen-based microorganisms to rot it. Remember how people once thought the moon was made of cheese? Well, now it will be. A dream no longer deferred.

Whatever we do, though, let’s make sure we don’t give it all away to someone who needs it. That would be un-American.",2016-06-02 14:00:00

The girl’s mother described how jihadi fighters had set fire to the family home in Mosul, northern Iraq, after they failed to pay a religious tax on time.

The tax, known as the Jaziya, is imposed on all non-Muslims in Isis controlled territories and is calculated according to their estimated net worth.

The unnamed mother described how “foreign” Isis fighters had arrived at her door and said she had two choices, either “you are to leave now or you are to pay the Jaziya"".

Human rights advocate, Jacqueline Issac, said the mother told them she would pay, but asked for a “few seconds” as her daughter was in the shower.

The jihadis reportedly refused to wait and lit the house with a torch immediately.

Both the mother and her daughter managed to escape the burning house, but the child died from her fourth degree burns a few hours later.

Ms Issac told the Daily Express: “The daughter had fourth degree burns and the mother took her daughter, scrambling, doing anything to save her.

“She rushed her to the hospital and her daughter died in her arms.

“The last thing her daughter said was: ‘Forgive them’.”

Last week, a leading cleric in Baghdad said the country’s ancient Christian population could disappear within five years because of the Isis threat.

Father Martin Hermis Dawood said he used to advise members of his congregation who were contemplating fleeing the country to stay strong, but since the emergence of the terror group two years ago he had told them to go.

Iraqi Christian leaders estimate the total number of Chaldean Catholics, Syrian Orthodox and members of the eastern Assyrian church - the main denominations in the country - has declined from 1.3 million people 20 years ago to just 400,000 today, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Father Dawood said: “We are in the middle, we have seen it. When newspapers published cartoons about the Prophet Mohammed, it was in Europe, but gangs tried to assault Christians here. Something happened in Belgium or in Holland, I paid here.

“We know very well that not every Muslim here is a terrorist, but there is a culture rising, not only here in Iraq, but in the Middle East. There’s a struggle happening in the whole world and we will be burned in this fire in the future.”",2016-06-02 13:30:00

Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic.

Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said.

Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones.

Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food?

The answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward. Here, we explore this hotly contested issue.

What the heck does organic mean anyway?

Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed.

“By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,” Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email.

When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says “100 percent organic” indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. “Organic,” on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while “made with organic ingredients” is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients.

There’s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an “excuse to charge more.”

Indeed, there’s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are.

Still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not.

A 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and “substantially higher” levels of antioxidants.

So, what does this mean for human health?

According to the Environmental Working Group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the USDA in 2014 contained pesticide residues. In some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled.

Pesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's to cancer and birth defects.

The jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health.

In the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency.

“We’re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis,” said Michael Crupain, the director of Consumer Reports’ Food Safety and Sustainability Center, in an earlier post. “It’s not realistic to expect we wouldn’t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal. We just don’t know enough about the health effects.”

Some organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects.

When it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, there's also conflicting data.

The 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods. A meta-analysis published two years later in the British Journal of Nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds.

A recent study, published in February, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids.

“Omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function,” wrote study co-author Chris Seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the U.K.’s Newcastle University. “But getting enough in our diet is difficult. Our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients.”

As for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut.

The Centers for Disease Control notes that ""[s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health"" because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop. So choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue.

Other ways of measuring “worth”:

When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth’s well-being, too.

“When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,” she told HuffPost. “Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me.”

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health.

But organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit.

Thomas Barwick/Getty Images

Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation.

Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large.

“Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,” he said. “It’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly.”

According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers.

“Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,” the nonprofit writes.

Many organic farms are small operations, though ""big organic"" farms do exist as well. If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you're often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce.

Organic on a budget

Regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just “buy organic to the extent you can, when you can.”

And there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply):

1. Prioritize your purchases.

“It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,” advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University’s Pancreas Center, in a blog post.

She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible.

“Some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,” she said.

Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. “The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,” said Lu.

For produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable.

“Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,” said Gerszberg.

The Environmental Working Group's “Dirty Dozen” and “Clean Fifteen” lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The “clean” list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower.

2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce.

Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative.

“The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor,” writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont. “Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities.”

Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient. It also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation.

It's estimated that the average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture. In contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less.

3. Buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too.

Many mainstream supermarkets, including Safeway, Target, Wal-Mart and H-E-B, carry organic store-brand options, while Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's sell organic foodstuffs in bulk. Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products.

4. Keep an eye out for sales and coupons. Sites like All Natural Savings and Organic Deals can help customers surface organic food deals.

5. Grow your own food. It might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isn't as difficult as it sounds. It just requires a bit of effort and patience. Good Housekeeping has some tips on how to start your own organic garden. Live in a small apartment? The Urban Organic Gardener website's got you covered.

The bottom line

So is buying organic worth it? Depending on your priorities, it might be. Ultimately, many experts agree that eating a balanced diet, while remaining conscientious about how your food choices impact the health of the planet and farming communities, is key.

575,Media and Political elites. ,http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/05/31/obama_s_new_overtime_regulations_draw_complaints_from_media_activists.html,"Noam Scheiber at the New York Times posted a fantastic piece Monday about a surprising source of opposition to the Obama administration’s new overtime regulations: media and political elites.

As of Dec. 1, the law will require employers to pay the vast majority of salaried employees earning less than $47,476 annually overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours a week, double the current standard. As Vice President Joe Biden said when he announced the new regulations earlier this month, “If you work overtime, you should actually get paid for working overtime.”

The administration estimates this will raise the pay of more than 4 million workers by $12 billion over the next decade. And if an employer doesn’t want to pay the bill? Well, employees gain free time.

Sounds great, right?

Not, apparently, if you are a New York publishing insider. “You want to bump into the boss at 8 o’clock at night,” Dan Reynolds, the chief executive of Workman Publishing and a man otherwise known as, uh, the boss, told Scheiber.

Or a political activist.

In a statement released shortly after the rules were announced, Andre Delattre, the executive director of the United States Public Interest Research Group, better known as US PIRG, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization, whined, “A person of means—in service of a cause to which they feel deeply committed—can volunteer to work for our organization for free for as many hours as they wish, but a person of lesser means—who is no less committed to the work we do—cannot agree to work for our organization for less than $47,476 without having their work hours strictly limited in order to keep our costs affordable.”

What’s going on here?

When the Obama administration first announced their intention to reform the overtime regulations two years ago, some of the most vehement protest came from employers of low-wage workers, like the fast food industry. And little wonder.

While hourly workers are almost always eligible for overtime pay, salaried workers are not—unless, that is, they earn less than the overtime threshold. When that amount was set at the current $23,660, there was an easy enough dodge. Give someone a managerial or professional title, and you were all but home free. While some companies—Hi, Chipotle!—have been sued by current and former employees who allege that their highfalutin’ job descriptions did not match the reality of their less than impressive responsibilities, it seems all but certain the vast majority got away with the practice.

Advertisement

The new rules are, of course, an attempt to do away with this rather disgraceful behavior. But raising the issue brought another uncomfortable truth to light. Employers in lower-prestige professions like fast food are not the only ones treating employees unfairly. Any number of higher-end, more prestigious industries were relying on the business model, too. Scheiber calls it “The Devil Wears Prada economy,” after the famed Lauren Weisberger novel, widely thought to be about her time working for Vogue’s Anna Wintour.

Advertisement

This is, of course, something of an established path for career advancement. You work long hours at your intro job—like, say, editorial assistant, or political canvasser, or would-be Hollywood agent—and try to take on extra duties as well, in the hopes the boss will notice you and promote you up.

Advertisement

This model has its supporters, including Slate’s Jordan Weissman, who wrote last year, “while overtime functions pretty well when it’s used to discourage companies from working vulnerable employees in low-skill positions to the bone, it’s not necessarily appropriate in creative industries where educated young people are out to make a name for themselves and margins are thin.”

However, an argument could be made that by enabling this sort of behavior at the more prestigious ends of the labor market, we are making the practice more acceptable for everyone by normalizing it.

Americans, somewhat famously, are a nation of workaholics. In 2014, a Gallup survey found that the average American claimed to be putting in 47 hours a week on the job. As I pointed out last year, most of us seem to think that’s proper, or at least acceptable. We idealize Silicon Valley, where outsize workweeks are the norm.

Advertisement

Yet this sort of time on the job is not exactly effective. Academic studies show that work performance deteriorates rapidly after someone puts in more than 50 hours a week. In fact, the drop-off point might even come after significantly fewer hours on the job. An Australian survey recently found that for people over the age of 40, performance began to decline after a mere 25 hours a week.

Moreover, it’s easy to suspect that the bosses claiming that their underlings are desperate to work long hours for low pay are telling themselves what they want to hear.

Advertisement

A quick tour of Glass Door, a site for job listings and career advice, makes it clear that many of US PIRG’s employees and former employees have a different take. “Take better care of your employees. Invest in them. Give them the financial resources to have a live outside of work,” one wrote the week after the new regulations were announced. “With such a low pay and laborious workload, it’s hard for people to make it a long-term job,” a former canvasser claimed. “Very long hours, high turnover, terrible work/life balance - employees are expected to devote almost all their time to their jobs (80+ hours a week),” wrote a third.

Liberals like to point fingers when people like presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims, “Wages are too high,” because, as he put it a Republican debate last November, “People have to go out, they have to work really hard and they have to get into that upper stratum.” But as the US PIRG example reveals, it turned out they—OK, we—have something of a problem of our own.

The truth is this: Underpaid overwork is underpaid overwork, and it shouldn’t matter if you are serving burritos at Chipotle, making Anna Wintour’s manicure appointments, or lobbying for political change. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. That means getting paid for every hour spent on the job, not to mention getting a break from it.",2016-06-01 20:56:00

Flirty Prince Harry can't keep away from glamorous US soldier at Invictus Games - there's just one problem

Prince Harry looks like he's smitten with US soldier Sergeant Elizabeth Marks - meeting her several times at his Invictus Games.

The flirtatious meetings between the two have set social media alight as the pair spent a number of hours together.

They were pictured together after the 25-year-old came first in the 100 metre freestyle with the Prince, 31, seemingly mesmerised by her leg-length tattoo.

They then shared a moving moment when Sergeant Marks gave Harry back the medal - one of four golds she won in the pool - asking him instead to deliver it to doctors and nurses at the British hospital that saved her life.

Sergeant Marks clearly found Harry hilarious as they were seen joking and laughing together as he tried on one of her US team tops.

“As soon as they met they just hit it off,” said a spectator.

“Sergeant Marks is extremely attractive and Harry clearly took a little bit of a shine to her after all what she has achieved.

“But when she asked for her medal to be given to doctors and nurses who saved her life back home he, like all of us, was bowled over.”

The next day they met up again with a kiss on the cheek as they were both spectating at the wheelchair rugby tournament.

Two years ago on the eve of competing in the first Invictus Games in London, Sgt Marks fell gravely ill when she collapsed with a lung condition.

Her trouble began on the flight over to the UK when she began losing her voice.

Initially she thought it was due to the amount of interviews she had done but by the time the plane landed in London, she couldn’t breathe and was taken to the Royal London Hospital and admitted for what they believed was pneumonia.

A specialist team from Papworth Hospital was brought in who placed her in an induced coma.

Speaking about her ordeal Sgt Marks said: “I landed in London and became very ill very rapidly, I was in hospital in London and went into respiratory distress syndrome, they shipped a team down from Papworth who put me on to ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] life support and that ultimately saved my life.

“And when they did so I was on it for 10 days and ended up waking in an army hospital in Germany having no idea what had happened.

“But they absolutely saved my life and I can’t thank the UK enough for having that kind of medical support and taking such good care of me.""

Sgt Marks joined the US army when she was 17 years old.

She suffered debilitating hip injuries in Iraq in 2010 that left her with no feeling in her left leg.

The Army evacuated her and flew her to Brooke Army Medical Centre in San Antonio, Texas, where she began a gruelling recovery.

She underwent three surgeries to restructure her hips and regain enough mobility to walk.

Doctors never determined what caused the illness and although the ECMO saved her life it left her with some neurological impairment.

The sergeant took to the pool in her bid ongoing bid to be cleared for duty to continue as an active soldier.

Arizona-born Sgt Marks now hopes to repeat her success at the Invictus Games at Rio’s Paralympics in September.

She is ranked number one in the world in the 100-meter breaststroke with a time of 1:30.44, according to the International Paralympic Committee.

577,Women. ,http://elitedaily.com/envision/which-demographic-buys-gas-guzzling-suvs-the-most/1508536/,"You know those big SUVs that rush by you on the highway with no regard for human life? Most of them are purchased by one particular demographic.

According to CarBuzz, SUV sales are skyrocketing as more fuel-efficient sport utility vehicles are introduced to the once struggling marketing. But who's buying them the most? You'll NEVER guess...

Believe it or not, women are actually purchasing more SUVs than men, according to recent data and research by Michigan-based firm MartizCX.

Mainstream small SUV sales to women increased by nearly 34 percent compared to a 22 percent increase in mainstream small SUV sales to men between 2010 and 2015. Within the women purchasing SUVs, 40 percent are single and unmarried.

Premium small SUV sales to women soared by 177 percent over the same 5 years.

But why?

TIME links the increased female-dominant SUV sales to a rise in income and educational attainment and a drop in marriages and child-bearing.

MartizCX reveals,

There's a group of single, professional females out there that need vehicles, and you need to be attentive to them.

It looks like single, professional females gravitate more toward practical, fuel-efficient SUVs rather than sports coupes and luxury sedans.

So far, the top five best-selling SUVs in 2016 are: Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Ford Explorer, and the Nissan Rogue respectively.

By the early hours of Friday 24 June, it will be clear if the UK has defied the experts and pollsters by voting to leave the European Union.

If that happens, a shattered David Cameron, his leadership already a matter of speculation, will have no option but to make a statement outside 10 Downing Street saying he will respect the mandate of the British people. The Treasury, Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) will move quickly to roll out well-hidden battle plans to prevent market chaos.

A shocked European political class will find itself grappling with an unprecedented, messy and sprawling divorce that could rumble on for years.

The EU will respond as it does to any crisis, and convene an emergency summit, probably as early as the weekend.

As the morning unfolds it will quickly become clear that although the basic Brexit procedures are set down in law with some clarity, the politics, timeframe and potentially explosive brinkmanship will bring deep uncertainty and new disputes between the Brexiters and Europe.

EU commission officials, for instance, claim the UK will rapidly discover it has put itself in the role of supplicant, and they even talk of throwing the country out on its ear. Jean-Claude Juncker has already warned the UK should remember that deserters are not greeted with open arms.

“It is in our interest to do the divorce as quickly as possible. There’s no appetite for negotiating new terms in the first two years,” one source says.



Others, mainly in the leave campaign, contend that a more stately, considered pace to the divorce is possible. They deny the EU holds all the cards in shaping a new relationship between an independent UK and a jilted Europe.

The weekend (24-26 June)

The high watermark of summer: as the Glastonbury faithful turn their attention to the headliners, and football fans gear up for the knockout phases of the European championships, officials in London and Brussels will be weighing a very different knockout. Rapidly the discussion will move to the processes of Brexit, and the irreversibility of the decision. Only Greenland (on achieving self-rule) and Algeria (on gaining independence from France) have left the European bloc, and the only legal pathway out of the current EU is through article 50, inserted in the 2009 Lisbon treaty. This allows a country two years to negotiate the terms of its exit from the moment it notifies the EU of its intention to leave. A Brexit vote does not represent that formal notification. Those playing for time will argue that six weeks must be allowed for legal challenges to the referendum result, so at the very least it might be best to wait for the result to be immune from legal interference.

But once the notification is triggered, negotiations cannot extend beyond a two-year notice period, unless all remaining EU member states agree to such an extension. It would therefore take just one member state to insist the divorce must happen at the end of the two years. Arguably, and this will be contested, the UK could at some point in the two years reverse its decision to leave. If, for instance, the deal offered by the EU were very poor, nothing in the EU treaty would prevent the UK government going back to a largely pro-remain UK parliament to seek a second referendum.

Week one

The EU’s instinctive response to a UK Brexit vote will be one of self preservation. An emergency summit is likely to seek the equivalent of the “Draghi moment” when the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, announced he would do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. With markets in turmoil, and Eurosceptics across Europe emboldened, the European political class will want a joint declaration of a determination to continue, possibly as an even more integrated Europe.

Divisions will start to emerge. Countries with strong ties to the UK such as Malta, Cyprus and Poland may plead for caution. Slovakia, which will hold the presidency of the council in the second half of 2016, is reluctant to see the UK go. The inclination across Brussels will be to treat the UK harshly so Brexit cannot be presented to other sceptical states as a cost-free option. “It will be imperative to prevent the Brexit contagion gripping other countries,” says one EU official. The French and Germans, facing challenges from their own Eurosceptics in 2017 elections, will demand action. They will want to know what kind of future relations with Europe the UK proposes. At issue will be the UK access to the single market and the continuance of the free movement of labour.

Andrew Duff, a former Liberal Democrat MEP, who helped devise article 50, says: “The EU could not allow a seceding state to spin things out for too long. The clause puts most of the cards in the hands of those that stay in.”

By the end of the week, the UK may find itself excluded from some EU meetings as the remaining 27 decide how to structure the withdrawal negotiations, based on proposals from the executive commission.

Week two

Inside the UK, Cameron will either fall on his sword, prompting a leadership contest at a point of economic turmoil, or say he has a duty to negotiate an exit, perhaps staying on until the autumn.

He has said he would immediately trigger article 50 because “the British people would rightly expect that to start straight away”. George Osborne has said that “this is crucially important, the one way the European Union itself has a legal basis to negotiate our exit is to trigger article 50. Article 50 would be triggered immediately and that process would begin.” The trigger would be pulled with a fortnight, Osborne added.

However, Dominic Cummings, the campaign director for Vote Leave, says an immediate move to set article 50 in motion would be “mad and like putting a gun into your mouth and pulling the trigger”.

Meanwhile, Michael Gove claims the remarks by Cameron and Osborne need to be filtered through the prism of the referendum campaign. It is in the interests of Cameron and the commission to play up the risk of a Brexit vote.

In reality, once defeated in the referendum the political authority of the Cameron-Osborne axis will have been blown away. The mantle will have passed to Gove, and to Boris Johnson. Both men have said there is no need to rush to the exit door.

The next few weeks

The shell-shocked 450-strong majority for remain in the House of Commons will have gathered its forces. A consensus will form that it would be best for all sides to take their time.

From Cummings’ point of view, time will be needed over the summer for the EU to admit it is in its self-interest to retain a close trading relationship with the UK. At play will be the UK’s continued membership of the single market, and free movement of EU citizens.

But Agata Gostyńska-Jakubowska of the pro-EU Centre for European Reform says delaying for too long “might be unacceptable for the EU partners”, further eroding goodwill and weakening their negotiating hand. The UK, by extending the agony, would be an unwanted participant in EU meetings.

So politically Britain will not be able to delay in perpetuity, and by the autumn the pressure for an article 50 notification will be overwhelming.

Once the article 50 trigger is pulled, the EU council of ministers, now certain that Brexit is happening, will by qualified majority voting agree a negotiation mandate, in the form of directives to the commission.

The full scale of the task facing Whitehall will become clear. The UK will have to renegotiate 80,000 pages of EU agreements, deciding those to be kept in UK law and those to jettison. British officials have said privately that nobody knows how long this would take, but some ministers say it would clog up parliament for years. Greenland, with a population of 55,000, took two years to negotiate its exit.

Brexiters often point to farming or fisheries as relatively easy to negotiate, yet 60% of UK food and drink exports go to the EU and 60% of fish. The EU and Norway spend four months negotiating a fisheries deal for 40 stocks. Yet EU-UK fisheries negotiations would have to contend with 140 stocks.

A senior UK official said: “The honest answer is nobody knows how long this would take and we would all be making it up.”

Winter 2016

One scenario is that the first set of negotiations surrounding withdrawal will be completed inside two years. They will cover issues such as residual EU budget payments to and from Britain, the acquired rights of UK citizens in Europe and the reciprocal rights of EU citizens in the UK, the pensions of British EU civil servants and relocation of EU agencies based in the UK.

However, longer-term issues such as future trade relations, including tariffs, are likely to be dealt with separately.

The negotiations will be grinding on, and the Brexit campaign may find some of its optimism about a new trade deal was unfounded. Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, has claimed “we will be able to trade with the single market on free-trade terms, without paying into the system or accepting freedom of movement”. He insists that access will be tariff-free, and that the UK is uniquely well placed to strike such a deal thanks to its large trade deficit with major EU countries. Elliott has reasoned: “I cannot imagine, the day after Britain votes to leave, Angela Merkel allowing a situation where the British markets were cut off for BMW or any of the other companies. Ditto the French farmers, the Italian fashion companies and what have you.”

Others say this is overly optimistic. Cameron, for instance, has pointed out that 44% of UK exports go to the European Union, while just 8% of what the EU exports goes the other way. In short, he says, Britain is the one in greatest need of an agreement.

Striking a trade deal on services, especially the critical financial services, will be difficult as France and Ireland eye a chance to end the dominance of the City of London, and grab business. Equally UK negotiators will find it hard to get countries such as China interested in negotiating a separate trade deal with the UK, as opposed to the whole EU.

As all this emerges from the Brussels negotiations, the UK parliament may assert itself and demand a closer relationship with the EU than the one envisaged by Brexiters. One model is offered by Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area. Another is Switzerland’s relationship with the EU – in effect a series of bilateral treaties.

MPs will start to use the Commons to rein in Gove and Johnson. If no trade deal is struck they will become increasingly worried as the UK will have no choice but to trade with the rest of Europe under World Trade Organisation rules.

The House of Commons foreign affairs committee recently spelled out the implication of this: “If no deal could be concluded within the two-year notice period, the UK would move to standard WTO relationship terms and would then need to decide which of the 6,987 directly applicable EU regulations would need to be replaced by UK law.”

Boris Johnson - going into bat for Britain? Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA

The French and German elections will be over. Eurosceptic parties will possibly have suffered because of the evident difficulties the UK is experiencing in its negotiations. The drawbacks of life outside the EU will have been clear to French and German voters.

Let’s imagine one far from implausible outcome. The EU has played hardball with the UK and the deadline for Brexit is imminent. Last-minute talks are due to start, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, insists he will bat for Britain through the night. With few bargaining chips at his disposal, he strikes a deal on the narrow terms of the UK exit but the future trading relationship is unclear. By default, Britain will cease to be a member of the European Union and will trade with Europe under WTO rules outside the single market, facing tariffs on exports.

This deal – such as it is – will need to be agreed by a qualified majority in the council of ministers. Any remaining UK allies in the council will be outvoted. Consent of both the European and UK parliaments will then be required, followed by ratification by member states. The UK, now outside the EU, will return to Brussels to reopen its trade talks.

It took 12 years to get into Europe and, the UK may discover, it will take just as long to get through the exit door.",2016-06-01 03:22:00
579,Cancel the Paris Climate Plan. ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/05/27/donald-trump-just-made-an-extremely-important-promise-its-one-of-his-worst-yet/,"The near-term political consequences of this will — or should — be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely. I don’t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it’s likely Sanders will see it this way, too.

To get all the details on Trump’s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer’s piece. Trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue GOP agenda of “fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production.” More important, with some reporters wondering what Trump’s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: He is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we’re currently putting in place to deal with it.

Trump said that the current environmental challenges that the Obama administration is trying to tackle are “phony.” He added that he would “rescind” the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the U.S.’s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. He would withdraw the U.S. from participation in that global accord.

As I’ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a Republican president — even one as masterfully competent and strong as Trump — to roll back the Clean Power Plan and/or withdraw from the Paris climate deal. But it’s possible that Trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback.

This deepens the contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton. While Clinton would not be as ambitious as Sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that Clinton would preserve and implement the Clean Power Plan and the global climate accord, and Trump would seek to reverse them both.

Sanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face:

Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016

And:

As a father of four and a grandfather of seven, I care about leaving a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016

It’s true that Sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient. But Sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it — and the Clean Power Plan — are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Sanders knows that the Paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem. Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. What’s more, even if the Paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. The accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. Obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible.

It is often said that Sanders may not help to unify the party because he has “nothing to lose” from a Democratic loss. I think that is wrong — I believe Sanders when he says a Trump presidency is unthinkable. And at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor Sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement’s influence going forward. Trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by Sanders’ own lights, we all have to lose from a Trump presidency. My bet is Sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to Trump’s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative.

* DOWN TO THE WIRE IN CALIFORNIA: Politico reports that the Clinton campaign thinks it might eke out a win over Bernie Sanders in California, due to the latter’s strategic errors:

The biggest problem for Sanders has to do with independent voters….Those voters can vote in the Democratic primary, but to do so they must request a Democratic ballot….Educating those independent voters about the clunky process was part of a [previous Sanders campaign] field organizing strategy…But the campaign decided to go in a different direction, instead focusing its dwindling resources on television advertising.

The likely close outcome means the delegate math will remain unchanged, though a lot of people will make claims about what the “narrative” of a Clinton defeat there supposedly means.

* NEW EXPLANATION FOR HILLARY EMAIL SETUP: A former State Department official has offered a new explanation in a deposition as part of a lawsuit by a conservative group:

Lewis A. Lukens, a former State Department administrative official, said in a sworn deposition last week that after Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, he had proposed accommodating her by setting up a desktop computer in her office that would not be connected to the department’s system. That would have allowed her to send and receive email on a personal account….But that idea was abandoned, Mr. Lukens testified, after an aide to the secretary told him that Mrs. Clinton was “very comfortable checking her emails on a BlackBerry, but she’s not adept or not used to checking her emails on a desktop.”

Clinton is frustrated that she can’t move past the drip-drip-drip nature of this story, but that isn’t going to happen until the FBI releases its findings, and even then it will probably continue.

* TRUMP’S GROUND GAME IS ‘NONEXISTENT’: The Associated Press recently reported that the Trump campaign is ramping up its organization in 15 states. NBC News reports that’s nonsense:

Story continues below advertisement

On the ground, there are few signs the action of building a large campaign apparatus is underway. One Trump campaign source told NBC News that boasting to the AP of 15 state directors being deployed was a “piece ginned up to make it seem like we’re doing something when we’re not.”….“It’s either fluid or non-existent,” the source continued, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “I would lean towards the latter.”

The question now is whether the RNC can make up for it and build an operation for him.

* REPUBLICANS SCRAMBLE TO BUILD TRUMP A GROUND GAME: Related to the above, Politico reports:

The Republican National Committee is scrambling to respond to increasingly frantic concerns from state GOP officials that the party has not provided enough field organizers and will be badly outgunned by Democrats in battleground states. POLITICO surveyed nearly two dozen GOP chairmen, officials and operatives in key swing states who said the RNC hadn’t delivered on promises, putting in peril their ability to launch the robust voter-turnout operation needed in the general election.

But surely Trump’s candidacy is so “uncoventional” that none of this will matter.

* REPUBLICANS WORRY ABOUT TRUMP’S FINANCE OPERATION: David Drucker reports that Republicans are wondering whether Trump can build up a fundraising operation in time:

The problem is that fundraising networks don’t bring in hundreds of millions of dollars overnight….The RNC has had a very successful election cycle fundraising, bringing in $144.8 million thus far, with $17.4 million in the bank as of April 30. But the demands of running a presidential campaign, as charged to do by Trump, are going to require considerably more money, and fast. Republicans in down-ticket races wonder if there is going to be any cash left over to help them.

Maybe if Trump brashly promises a “world class” finance operation enough times, one will eventually materialize.

* TRUMP IS CONFIDENT HE’LL BROADEN THE MAP: On the campaign trail last night, Trump talked about how competitive he’ll be in states off limits to Republicans. Jenna Johnson summarizes his argument:

Which states will Trump target? California. Ohio, where he plans to spend a lot of money. Michigan. New York, his home state which was once represented by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the U.S. Senate. Florida, where he owns several golf resorts and a private club where he often lives. And Virginia, which is also home to a Trump golf course.

California and New York? Sorry, but no. Michigan? Maybe. But to make that happen, he’d have to pull off a large double digit swing among those blue collar whites that supposedly love him so much.

* TRUMP’S BOGUS ECONOMIC CREDENTIALS: Paul Krugman takes apart the idea that Donald Trump’s supposedly formidable business skills equip him to run the country:

Does business success carry with it the knowledge and instincts needed to make good economic policy? No, it doesn’t….a country is nothing like a corporation, and running a national economy is nothing like running a business….A tycoon who has enough humility to realize that he doesn’t already know all the answers, and is willing to listen to other people even when they contradict him, could do fine as an economic manager. But does this describe anyone currently running for president?

As Krugman notes, however, Trump is currently favored over Clinton on the economy. We’ll see what happens to those numbers after Democrats spend a few hundred million prosecuting his business past, however.",2016-05-29 19:43:00

581,Its very likely. ,http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/north-korea-bank/484628/?utm_campaign=fuckapathy,"A security research company has found ties between $81 million stolen from the central bank of Bangladesh, the Sony email hacks, and bank thefts across the world.

Security investigators linked thefts from banks in Asia, including the $81 million stolen from the central bank of Bangladesh in February, to a hacking group in North Korea.

The research firm Symantec has been looking into the Bangladesh bank heist, and on Thursday it posted on its blog that a similar code used to steal Bangladesh’s millions was also used to hack a bank in the Philippines, as well as a failed attempt on a bank in Vietnam last year. The code, Symantec said, has also been linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures’s emails.

Investigators say the malware the thieves used shared similarities to the code used by a hacking group known as Lazarus. The FBI has linked this group to the Sony hacks, and those hacks to North Korea. That group has also been tied to attacks as far back as 2009, which mainly focused on the U.S. and South Korea, but it is also believed to be responsible for hacks on countries all over the world, such as the $12 million stolen from an Ecuadoran bank last year.

The way hackers broke into the banks was by infiltrating the industry’s global messaging system, SWIFT. The system is run by the world’s largest banks, is based in Brussels, and prides itself on security.

The New York Times adds:

North Korea’s economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations. Pyongyang does not publish economic data, but estimates have put North Korea’s gross domestic product between $12 billion and $40 billion, tiny when compared with South Korea’s economic output of more than $1.4 trillion.

An expert quoted by the Times said: “If you presume it’s North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P. This is not small change for them.”

Since investigators learned how hackers stole Bangladesh’s money, banks that had kept similar heists quiet have come forward: Just last week, it was revealed in a lawsuit that the Banco del Austro in Ecuador was targeted, as well.",2016-05-28 23:41:00
582,The economy. More people are flying. ,https://www.vox.com/2016/5/27/11790252/airport-security-lines-tsa,"Since March, the nation's biggest airports have been in the grips of a line apocalypse. Security lines have metastasized. What were once unusually long waits have become routine. Big airports are threatening to kick out the Transportation Security Administration and turn the security process back over to private contractors.

Watch the security line at DIA grow. From 4:30, to 5:00, to 5:45. Now it's almost to baggage claim @DenverChannel pic.twitter.com/r9sWcNrK0m — Jason Gruenauer (@JGonTV) May 26, 2016

The lines aren't invariably nightmarish at every airport, all day long. Still, many people, including me, have missed flights because they arrived at the airport at what used to be a reasonable time and found themselves still trapped in line as their flight took off.

The immediate reason for the long lines is pretty simple: Americans are flying more than ever, and the TSA hasn't grown quickly enough to keep up. But the current mess is also a direct result of the TSA's last crisis. Last fall, the agency got in trouble for not doing enough to keep weapons and explosives off planes, and stepped up security as a result.

The TSA has serious problems with culture and management, including disciplining whistleblowers who called out problems. But it's also stuck between a rock and a hard place, the victim of a political consensus that insists airport security must be perfectly airtight without ever being even the slightest bit inconvenient.

Lines are getting longer partly because more people are flying

In one sense, the long lines are good news: They're a sign of economic recovery as more people are flying.

The number of Americans flying dropped precipitously as the recession began, and didn't recover to its 2007 level until 2014. But over the past year and a half, many more people have been flying: Nearly 900 million people passed through American airports in 2015, up 5 percent from 2014. The number of people the TSA had to screen, since some of those passengers came from foreign airports, increased by 6 percent.

At the same time, airplane tickets have gotten cheaper as oil prices have fallen. The average domestic plane ticket cost $363 last year, down 8 percent from 2014. It was less expensive to fly in 2015 than in any year since 2010.

So far this year, both trends have continued. Overall passenger traffic increased 4 percent in January and 6 percent in February compared with 2014, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Some of the biggest airports — Denver, Los Angeles, New York's JFK, and San Francisco — have seen even bigger increases.

Fares, too, are continuing to fall. Hopper, an app that tracks airline ticket prices, is predicting the lowest summer airfares since 2009.

But more people flying also means more people in security lines. And TSA staffing hasn't kept up. There are 15 percent more people flying than in 2013, and the TSA has 12 percent fewer staff.

Congress isn't wholly to blame for the budget cuts. The Department of Homeland Security's own budget request for the 2016 fiscal year proposed cutting 1,666 screeners' jobs, saying that ""risk-based screening practices"" — such as getting people signed up for TSA's PreCheck program, which allows you access to expedited security if you pass a background check and pay $85 — were making checkpoints more efficient. The goal, the department wrote, was to ""continue transitioning to a smaller, more skilled, professional workforce.""

The agency now admits that this was a mistake, and is hiring 768 more screeners.

Some airports want to solve the problem by hiring contractors to handle security rather than the TSA, though it's not clear if that would make much of a difference. Some airports with privatized security still have passengers reporting long lines, including San Francisco International and Rochester, New York:

Lines weren't longer before because the TSA was sending people to expedited security

As airline passenger counts were reaching record-breaking levels in 2014, the TSA also started hurrying people through its expedited security lanes.

Since 2011, the TSA has offered PreCheck, which essentially offers pre-9/11 security for a price: Travelers at more than 150 airports keep their shoes and jackets on and their laptops and liquids in their bags, and they get to go through a regular metal detector rather than a body-scanning machine.

But initially the program didn't catch on as widely as the TSA hoped. Most Americans aren't frequent fliers, and the program cost $85. By late 2014, fewer than half a million people had signed up for PreCheck, the Wall Street Journal reported.

So in order to make sure the PreCheck lines were used, the TSA started routing regular passengers into them. In September 2013, just 10 percent of passengers got expedited screening — because they were over 70 or under 12, or because they were preapproved through PreCheck or Global Entry, a program focused on world travelers that allows them to get through customs more quickly.

Then in October 2013, the TSA expanded PreCheck to people who hadn't directly signed up for it, and the number of people getting expedited security immediately tripled.

There were a few ways to get PreCheck access without paying for it — you could be selected before arriving at the airport, based on the information you provide when you book your ticket, a program known as Secure Flight.

Or you could be routed into the PreCheck lanes at the airport once you were already there, a program known as ""managed inclusion."" The TSA would randomly assign people to either normal or expedited security lines. TSA officers observing travelers' behavior could pull you out of the expedited line, and explosives detection hand swab machines and dogs were supposed to add an additional layer of security.

The Government Accountability Office warned in March 2015 that these procedures hadn't been fully tested. Previous reports had suggested that the behavior detection officers aren't all that effective — a conclusion the TSA disagrees with. Still, at the time, the TSA was sending nearly half of all passengers to expedited screening, even though only about 7.2 million were actually qualified for PreCheck based on their background check, security clearance, or other factors:

Expediting the security lines sped up security and reduced the need for TSA screeners. But it also meant that security itself was less thorough. And if there's one thing the American people hate more than long security lines, it's the idea that a terrorist might be able to get a knife, gun, or bomb onto an airplane.

The TSA is trying to be less bad at its actual job: security

Then, starting last summer, a report from the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general concluded that the TSA was very, very bad at its actual job. Although the report was supposed to be classified, some damning details leaked: 95 percent of attempts to sneak prohibited items through security were successful.

The test results ""were disappointing and troubling,"" John Roth, the inspector general, said in congressional testimony in November. ""We found layers of security simply missing.""

Randomly choosing passengers for PreCheck took a lot of heat. Congressional hearings featured one whistleblower who said the TSA was ""handing out PreCheck status like Halloween candy.""

So in response, the TSA clamped down on security. It was obvious that this would lead to longer security waits, as Jason Edward Harrington, a former TSA employee, wrote for the Guardian in June 2015:

The greatest challenge when it comes to such failures stems from the fundamental catch-22 of the TSA’s mission: if agents properly execute their duties, then internal testing results will improve and airplanes might be slightly safer. But meticulous adherence to the TSA’s standard of practice will mean lines that back up to the ticketing counters. Flights will be missed due to the enormous security delays, and the distended passenger lines themselves will become choice terrorist targets. It’s a classic quantity-versus-quality dilemma.

In October 2015, the TSA discontinued managed inclusion, the program that sends travelers into PreCheck lines at the airport and monitors them with behavior officers and explosive trace detectors.

Starting last fall, the TSA and some reporters warned that lines were going to get longer. Washington, DC's airports noticed the change almost immediately, the Washington Post reported.

""I knew that would dramatically increase the number of people in the standard lanes,"" Peter Neffenger, the administration's head, said at congressional hearings this week. But the TSA had planned its budget assuming the expedited screening was going to continue.

Since the uproar began about the long lines, Neffenger said the agency is holding daily calls with the busiest airports and has established a national command center to monitor security wait times. And some travelers still manage to breeze through the lines with no trouble:

One week ago: 1+ hour waits @ATLairport but now NO LINE for main security checkpoint pic.twitter.com/OOvPvW2Sux — Steve Gehlbach (@SteveGWSB) May 23, 2016

But as long as Americans insist that airport security be flawless, cheap, and fast, the seesawing between outrage that the TSA is too slow and that the TSA isn't doing enough is likely to continue.

Mostly, it looked like the sort of geeky local bee I might have attended as a kid—except everyone there was Indian. Inside Shawnee’s Hindu Temple and Cultural Center, 23 awkward kids took turns passing a microphone back and forth in a hushed beige auditorium. No spotlights, no podium, just cringe-inducing feedback on the P.A. system. And for the record, the spelling was a-t-r-o-c-i-o-u-s. Just three of the first 10 contestants spelled their words correctly. At one point, a poor kid paced in circles and clutched his crotch before misspelling beleaguered and sprinting off to the restroom.

Amid it all, 13-year-old Kavya Shivashankar pronounced words from a fold-out judging table as her father, Mirle, emceed in a sharp dark suit. Kavya, the 2009 Scripps National Spelling Bee champion, is a spelling superstar complete with signature move: She air-writes each word across her palm before speaking it. Kavya and Mirle—her innovative, ever-enthusiastic coach—were at the small-time competition to pay homage. Over the past two decades, tournaments like this one—a regional qualifier for the North South Foundation’s spelling league—have become a breeding ground for Scripps contenders. These minor-league competitions help kids as young as 6 years old work out the spelling kinks at an early age. The result has been an Indian-American dynasty at the National Spelling Bee.

Consider the facts: Indian-Americans make up about 1 percent of the U.S. population; this year, an estimated 30 NSF-ers will compete at Scripps, 11 percent of the 273-kid field. Recent winners include Sai R. Gunturi from Dallas, who nonchalantly reassembled pococurante for a national title in 2003. Sameer Mishra from West Lafayette, Ind., nailed guerdon in 2008. And four-time finalist Shivashankar made it back-to-back titles for North South Foundation competitors last year, air-writing Laodicean for the win. If Shivashankar hadn’t come through, it’s possible another North South graduate would have: Four other NSF kids cracked the top 10 behind her.

The NSF circuit consists of 75 chapters run by close to 1,000 volunteers. The competitions, which began in 1993, function as a nerd Olympiad for Indian-Americans—there are separate divisions for math, science, vocab, geography, essay writing, and even public speaking—and a way to raise money for college scholarships for underprivileged students in India. There is little financial reward for winners (just a few thousand dollars in college scholarships) compared with the $40,000 winning purse handed out each year by Scripps. Still, more than 3,000 kids participated in NSF’s spelling events this year due in part to what NSF founder Ratnam Chitturi calls a sort of Kavya Effect. “Most American kids look up to sports figures,” he says. “Indian kids are more interested in education, and they finally have a role model.”

Just as Kavya Shivashankar has inspired the next wave of Indian spellers, Kavya found her bee mojo during the post- Spellbound boom. Before Spellbound, the 2002 documentary that featured Indian-American Nupur Lala’s run to the 1999 Scripps title, many first-generation South Asian parents saw NSF as a way for their children to assimilate—the best way to understand a culture, after all, is to learn its language. They used the North South Foundation events as a sort of SAT prep, teaching their children to use phonetics, etymology, and word roots to suss out answers. “Our focus is not on competition,” says Chitturi. “Winning becomes an outcome of you focusing on learning. You are competing against yourself, not these other people.”

After Spellbound, that changed a bit. After Balu Natarajan (winning word: milieu) became the first Indian-American to win Scripps back in 1985, he went on to a career in sports medicine. When Lala did it in 1999 with logorrhea, she became a movie star. (OK, a movie star and a neuroscientist.) Kavya has called Lala an inspiration—the license plate of Mirle’s teal minivan reads “SPL BND.” She’s far from alone. In 2002, NSF had less than 20 chapters pulling in about 500 mostly middle-school-age spellers. Then pop culture galvanized an expansion to elementary schoolers; today, six times as many students compete in North South Foundation spelling events. “The parents were just excited,” Chitturi says. “They saw that it was a possibility [to win the National Spelling Bee].”

It’s no coincidence, then, that in the last decade North South Foundation has transformed from an SAT prep course into a training ground for Scripps. It wasn’t too long ago that NSF standouts like Kamran Riaz and 2000 champion Ashley Thakur didn’t compete at the National Spelling Bee. Riaz, for one, remembers NSF as a nice “alternative” to Scripps. Thakur’s thoughts on the National Spelling Bee: “Not to brag, but I don’t think it would be a hard cake to cut,” she once bragged to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

It’s not quite right to say that Riaz and Thakur didn’t go to nationals because they didn’t think it was a big deal. The more significant reason is that they simply weren’t eligible. You have to be more than a great speller to qualify for the National Bee—you also have to live in a school district with a sponsoring newspaper or community organization. These days, parents seem to be paying a lot more attention to such logistics. When Mirle Shivashankar realized in 2005 that there was just one Scripps sponsor in all of Kansas, he beat the bushes to ensure that more kids from the state—his daughter, for one—would have the chance to go to nationals. Kavya subsequently gained all of her berths to the nationals by virtue of a brand-new sponsor, the Olathe News.

The North South Foundation could dominate Scripps even further, if more of its spellers were eligible to compete. In areas with more gifted NSFers than competition zones, the battle to get into Scripps can be intense. Whereas regional North South Foundation competitions are run like standardized tests—the best scores get weighted against a national average to determine the national finalists—Scripps operates more like a crazy single-elimination tournament. The winner in each local bracket funnels into a pool of finalists, who repeat the same process to pick a winner. That can lead to some powerhouse regional showdowns. In San Jose, Calif., for instance, eventual 2009 NSF senior co-champion Ramya Auroprem had to beat out 2009 NSF runner-up Sidarth Jayadev just to make it into last year’s National Spelling Bee finals.

North South Foundation winners don’t have to worry about Kavya Shivashankar anymore—she has retired. At the Shawnee NSF contest this April, Swetha Jasti placed first, with a perfect score that qualified her for NSF nationals later this summer. But unfortunately for Jasti, she won’t make it to Scripps this year. When the National Spelling Bee starts up this week, their region will be represented by a surprise challenger: Kavya’s 8-year-old sister, Vanya, who drubbed Jasti in the National Spelling Bee’s Olathe qualifier.

For youngsters like Vanya, this is Scripps’ best selling point: Whereas the North South Foundation still divides contestants into junior and senior levels, the National Spelling Bee has no minimum age requirement. Vanya, who has taken to referring to herself and her sister as the Eli and Peyton Manning of spelling, will be the youngest competitor in Washington, D.C., this year. When ESPN recently showed up in Kansas to film a miniprofile for the contest, she grinned unabashedly. “Now it’s my turn,” she proclaimed to the room full of cameras. As with most things in the life of an NSF standout, the moment seemed well-rehearsed.

584,"Children's ""Safe Space/Classrooms"". ",https://www.devp.org/en/blog/youll-never-guess-whats-inside-tent,"Upon my recent visit to Iraq, I saw the intense psychological distress that over 500,000 Iraqi Yazidis1 experience every day. They have had to abandon their houses and families in order to o survive the violence of the armed group calling itself the Islamic State, who’s made lightning-fast advances throughout the country.

All of them suffered the horrors of war in some way, and many of them are still plagued by the effects of post-traumatic stress. The vast majority of the victims are under 18.

Young Yazidi in the Dahuk region of northern Iraq

What can we do for these uprooted youths, forced to live far from their homes in camps or makeshift shelters? What happens when the closest school is four hours away on foot and so overcrowded it cannot accept any new students?

This is why for the last few months Development and Peace, in partnership with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD), has been involved in a project to create youth centres that provide these kids in dire need with a safe space.

This tent lets 240 children learn in a fun environment and helps them return to a normal routine.

Thanks to our project, over 900 children have access, twice a week, to a tent, the inside of which resembles a classroom.

On site, an intervention team offers children a variety of activities and a positive environment in which they can feel safe. Women account for at least 50% of each team, as children are more likely to confide their psychological distress to a woman. Furthermore, some of the staff hired to run these centres are displaced people, in an effort to provide them and their families with extra income.



The tents’ interior looks like a classroom, and fun and educational activities are offered to the children.

Priority activities

Thanks to our partners’ experience with other displaced populations, and after consulting the target population during the analysis phase of the project, it was decided to offer five types of activities in the centres:

Recreational games for children;

Informal education, by age group, with an emphasis on building vocabulary;

Team-spirit building activities;

Peaceful conflict-resolution activities; and

Activities in which children can talk about the stress they’ve experienced.

Colouring activity in the village of Shaekadry’s youth centre (Iraqi Kurdistan)

These spaces are also used by the staff to assess the wellbeing of the children, and ensure that they receive the psychological care they might require. Already, close to 50 children have been diagnosed with severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and have been referred to a specialist who will be able to give them proper care.



These centres are not meant to replace real schools, but in a context of mass displacement and overcrowded classrooms, they ensure that children can continue their education while on the waiting list to enroll permanently in a local school. Without this interim program, a whole generation might struggle with learning issues and face a bleak future.

It is not too late to make a donation and help more children gain access to these centres.



Here are a few children I had the privilege of meeting:





Sonja, age 15, wants to learn Arabic and English.

Lisa, age 11, thanks us for creating this centre. She likes the activities offered, but wishes she could take Arabic lessons.

Shamo, age 12, loves it when we teach him some English words.

Randy, age 12, is grateful when teachers manage to make him forget “the things he’s seen” and hopes to become an engineer.

1Who are the Yazidis? They are a Kurdish-speaking community of about 600,000 people. They are among the oldest ethnoreligious groups of Mesopotamia, where their belief system appeared over 4,000 years ago.

585,$14 Billion last year. ,http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/26/you-wont-believe-how-much-banks-make-in-overdraft.aspx,"The bank overdraft fee seems a bit like the financial equivalent of kicking a man when he's down. Having to pay $35 or so because you don't have enough money to cover a check you wrote is like having life hand you lemons -- and then squirt lemon juice in your eye.

Basically, the overdraft and its cousin, the fee for insufficient funds, amount to a further tax on people who are already not doing so well. To make matters worse, in many cases overdraft fees can set off a cascade of unexpected bad checks for people operating on a tight budget. That can turn a $35 problem into something much bigger, according to the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL), which just released a research report entitled ""Broken Banking: How Overdraft Fees Harm Consumers and Discourage Responsible Bank Products.""

In the report, which examined data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, CRL essentially found that overdraft fees were too lucrative for banks to consider giving them up. Even if they want to reform -- and some banks have made changes to certain accounts -- it's hard to walk away from the $14 billion in overdraft fees ($17 billion when you add in charges for insufficient funds) American banks generated last year, according to CRL.

""CRL's analysis confirms that overdraft abuses continue, carrying an enormous annual price tag for consumers as a whole, and with devastating effects on individuals,"" said Peter Smith, a senior researcher at CRL and the report's co-author in a press release.

Is the number really that high?

In the first three months of 2015 the three biggest banks in the United States -- JPMporgan Chase ( JPM -2.81% ), Bank of America ( BAC -3.62% ), and Wells Fargo ( WFC -4.78% ) -- made $1.1 billion in overdraft fees, CNN Money reported. That projects out to $4.5 billion in 2015, or $20 for every America adult, reported the website.

For the big banks, however, overdraft fees represent only a small percentage of total revenue. Even though the totals add up to astounding numbers, overdraft fees accounted for less than 6% of non-interest revenue at JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, according to a report by SNL Financial.

Smaller banks, the study found, can make much more than the overall median of 8% non-interest revenue. Woodforest National Bank, which had over 750 branches in 17 states, and First National, which operated just under 300 locations, made more than 40% of their of non-interest revenue from overdraft charges at the time of the study, according to SNL Financial.

""These banks are highly reliant on these charges,"" says Tyler Hall, a senior bank analyst at SNL Financial. ""It just points out that's their business model.""

Altogether, in the first three months of 2015, the nearly 600 banks that reported overdraft fees took in $2.5 billion in overdraft fees -- not quite as much as CRL projects, but not so far off as to make its report invalid.

How does this happen?

For consumers with low balances, an unexpected overdraft fee dig a hole that's hard to get out of. CRL explained the process in its press release.

Frequently marketed as a 'customer service', overdraft fees are incurred when a bank account lacks sufficient funds to cover a transaction and the institution pays the transaction anyway. The institution then repays itself the value of the overdraft transactions, and all accompanying fees, from the account holder's next incoming deposit.

Debit card payments and paper check payments alike can result in overage fees, which average $35, but that may only be the start of the problem. ""If time lags before the account is replenished, the institution may charge additional 'sustained' overdraft fees, and a bank is also able to charge for multiple overdrafts before the account is replenished,"" according to the CRL report.

""Financial institutions take advantage of consumers fighting desperately to stay afloat,"" said Rebecca Borné, report co-author and CRL senior policy counsel. ""CFPB should require that overdraft fees be reasonable and proportional to the cost to the institution, much the same way that credit card penalty fees are regulated. Overdraft fees should also be limited to one per month and six per year.""

What happens next?

Many of the smaller banks make so much money on overdraft fees that they have little incentive to reform. The larger banks like JPMporgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, however, could in theory spur a change, given that they don't rely on overdraft fees for much of their revenue.

One simple way to reform these practices, according to CRL, would simply be to deny charges when consumers do not have the funds in their account to pay for them. That would stop the chain dead before it has a chance to snowball on the consumer, and it would stop the banks from offering unregulated de facto credit products to consumers who can't afford them.",2016-05-28 15:23:50

588,69% more for out-of-pocket health care costs than men. ,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/women-pay-more-healthcare,"When it comes to healthcare, being a woman means you'll have some extra, shall we say, considerations. Shouldering the brunt of the birth control burden, making regular trips to the gyno for screenings, and, oh yeah, that whole political firestorm surrounding a woman’s right to access certain types of healthcare are just a few of the things that women have to factor into their decisions.

But according to new data from healthcare company Vitals, women have one more thing to worry about: disproportionate costs.

On average, women pay 69 percent more for out-of-pocket healthcare costs than men.

Vitals

Although groan-inducing, the numbers aren’t that surprising. The bills for standard preventative care, breast and ovarian cancer screenings, and birth control—not to mention being actually, you know, sick—aren’t cheap. The costs add up.

Sign up for Women's Health's new newsletter, So This Happened, to get the day’s trending stories and health studies.

According to the data from Vitals, women can expect to shell out some serious cash for the health issues we encounter over a lifetime. One in four women will have her tubes tied, which can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $6,000. And women are four to six times more likely than men to have knee pain, which can mean a $65,000 knee replacement. Even barring any of these major expenses, regular old mammograms can run up to $200 a pop. Not cool.

Time to start thinking about making healthcare costs a bigger line item in your long-term budget.

597,No. ,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/10/9886152/donald-trump-fascism,"Is Donald Trump a fascist?

That question emerged in various forms pretty early in his 2016 presidential campaign, which began with a speech railing against Mexican immigrants, and gained steam after he called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” in December 2015, as a response to the San Bernardino terrorist attack.

At that point, the Muslim ban proposal, I contacted five fascism experts and asked them if Trump qualified. They all said no. Every one of them stated that to be a fascist, one must support the revolutionary, usually violent overthrow of the entire government/Constitution, and reject democracy entirely. In 2015, none were comfortable saying Trump went that far. He was too individualist for the inherently collectivist philosophy of fascism, and not sufficiently committed to the belief that violence is good for its own sake, as a vital cleansing force.

Roger Griffin, the author of The Nature of Fascism and a professor of history at Oxford Brookes University, summed it up well: “You can be a total xenophobic racist male chauvinist bastard and still not be a fascist.”

Five years have now passed, and the fascism questions have only grown more frequent. Trump has had time to implement quite anti-immigrant and anti-Black policies, and refused to denounce his most extreme and violent supporters, from the neo-Nazis and white nationalists in Charlottesville to the Proud Boys group. And every week, I receive dozens of emails from readers wondering if I stand by my conclusion in 2015, that Trump is simply a bigot with an authoritarian streak, not a fascist.

So I reached out to the experts I talked to back then. Four of the five replied, and I also got in touch with a few more scholars who have researched fascism to get a broader view.

The responses were, again, unanimous, albeit tinged with much greater concern about Trump’s authoritarian and violent tendencies. No one thinks Trump is a fascist leader, full stop. Jason Stanley, a Yale philosopher and author of How Fascism Works, came closest to that conclusion, saying that “you could call legitimately call Trumpism a fascist social and political movement” and that Trump is “using fascist political tactics,” but that Trump isn’t necessarily leading a fascist government.

But most experts did not even go that far, and some expressed concern that describing Trump as a fascist undermines the term and leads to a misanalysis of our current political situation. “If Trump was a fascist and we were in a situation akin to Germany in 1932 or Italy in 1921, certain kinds of actions would be justified,” Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, says. “But we are not and they are not.”

To be clear, “not fascist” is a very, very low bar for Trump to clear. The concerns that lead people to ask the question “Is Trump a fascist?” are real. Trump really is trying to discredit the coming presidential election. He really has hired officials with ties to white nationalist groups. He really did promise to ban all Muslims from the US (and implemented new rules toward that goal), said that a Mexican American judge is unfit to preside over cases involving him, called Mexican immigrants “rapists,” empathized with neo-Nazis after Charlottesville, and falsely claimed Muslim Americans celebrated the 9/11 attacks — among many, many transgressions.

But things could always get worse. There really are leaders who suspend elections, dissolve legislatures, throw large numbers of citizens into camps without trial or appeal, who turn their nations into one-party states oriented around a cult of national rebirth. The fascist leaders of the past, the University of Texas’s Jason Brownlee notes, “not only pursued right-wing policies, they also built-up mass-mobilizing parties and paramilitary organizations with the goal of sweeping aside alternative movements and establishing single-party dictatorship.”

That hasn’t happened here — but it could. It came terrifyingly close to happening in Greece, where the explicitly neo-Nazi Golden Dawn became the third-largest political party in the mid-2010s. And if and when it does happen in America, we need to have the right terms and tools to confront it.

I stand by what I have already written about Trump and fascism, but there is one change: I am struck now with Trump’s growing willingness to employ physical violence.

Before, Trump was already willing to tolerate some roughing-up of hecklers at rallies, and his encouragement of the “lock her up!” refrain was clearly transgressive (in America we are supposed to wait for the decision of a jury of citizens before locking someone up). But now, after Charlottesville, we have the Proud Boys and the aggression against the governor of Michigan. So Trump gets closer to having his own SA [the Nazi paramilitary group], a sobering thought as the election approaches.

But there is still no state management of the economy here (as there was to a degree in Nazi Germany and fascist Italy). Trump is content to aid business by reducing government protections of the environment and of workers … and his economic policy is mainly just to let businessmen do what they want, So I still think terms like “oligarchy” and “plutocracy” work for Trump, with the added thought that he is close to crossing the line with his toleration of violence.

Matthew Feldman, director, Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right

Although my position has not changed on Trump — less fascist than kleptocrat, more egoist than radical-right ideologue — that does little to mitigate the danger.

Four months ago, I warned that Trump was descending into naked authoritarianism. Low-information commentators seek to reassure rather than dig deeply, telling readers to look on the bright side. That the US is an exceptional country.

It is not.

Democratic regression and political polarization are not unique to the US. Having more guns than people is. So are militias, usually formed of lower- and middle-class white Americans harboring anti-government sentiments. The threat posed by these anti-government extremists — though not necessarily terrorists — was thrown into relief when at least 13 members of Michigan’s Wolverine Militia were arrested for planning to kidnap, “judge,” and potentially execute for treason the state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer.

The term “fascist” regarding Trump continues to mislead rather than inform. But that cannot inure us to what Alexander Reid Ross has called the “fascist creep.”

Stanley Payne, Jaume Vicens Vives and Hilldale professor emeritus of history, the University of Wisconsin Madison

This inquiry made a little sense four years ago, when Trump was still an unknown quantity, but now he has a record. Well — that’s pretty thin gruel. Nothing much to work with here. The Democrats won the first election under Trump [the 2018 midterms], and I’m not aware of anything negative happening. Straining at gnats doesn’t really get us anywhere. Mostly these are just silly public remarks. Hitler’s place in history is not based on his remarks, nor for any temporary detention cages. Please do not trivialize. That indicates absence of an argument.

Roger Griffin, emeritus professor in modern history, Oxford Brookes University

His relationship to democracy, I would really insist, is the key to answering whether he’s a fascist or not. Even in four years of incoherent and inconsistent tweets, he’s never actually done a Putin and tried to make himself a permanent president, let alone suggest any coherent plan for overthrowing the constitutional system. And I don’t even think that’s in his mind. He is an exploiter, he’s a freeloader. He’s a wheeler and dealer. And that is not the same as an ideologue.

So he’s absolutely not a fascist. He does not pose a challenge to constitutional democracy. He certainly poses a great challenge to liberalism and liberal democracy. And I think real favor will be served by journalists who, instead of seeing liberal democracy as a single entity, see it as a binomial. Democracy can exist without liberalism.

If I was doing this as a bottom line in some debate, I’d say that Trump is not a fascist, but what he is quite consistently is an illiberal democrat. He is a democrat to the extent that he’s used democratic processes to be where he is, which he doesn’t radically challenge. He obviously plays fast and loose, like any wheeler dealer, with things like the Supreme Court, who he gets in, etc. He doesn’t care about the rules, but the core system he doesn’t want to change, because he’s somebody who’s profited by that system.

Basically, I think it matters whether we call Trump fascist or not fascist, not academically or intellectually, but because it’s a red herring — it actually diverts attention from where we should be doing the critique. If all our intellectual energies are, like Don Quixote, jousting with windmills and fascism, instead of actually jousting with the real enemies of democracy, and using our energies to avert the climate crisis, which is going to engulf us all, if we’re not careful, then we’re wasting our time.

By not calling him fascist, and concentrating on the way he perverts democracy, we see Trump in a different context. We don’t see him as Hitler or Mussolini. We see him in a different rogues’ gallery. And the rogues’ gallery is made up of a whole load of dictators throughout history, including Putin and Erdogan and Orbán and Assad today, who have abused constitutionalism and democracy to rationalize their abuse of power and their crimes against humanity.

Sheri Berman, professor of political science, Barnard College, Columbia University

On Trump and fascism, unlike what has become an almost majority view, I do not like applying that term to Trump or to what is going on in this country.

Partially this is for historical and intellectual reasons — just like we shouldn’t call every horrible example of ethnic violence or even ethnic cleansing “genocide” (or say that it is another Holocaust), so I think we should be careful with comparing Trump to Hitler. Genocide means something: It is an attempt to wipe out an entire people, using the full force of the modern state. Similarly, national socialism or, more broadly, fascism was a totalitarian ideology and political regime that wanted to do away not only with liberalism and democracy but to revolutionize society, economy, and politics. That’s not the same as any old dictatorship, even a nasty one, and that is not where we are today.

That said, just as ethnically based violence or ethnic cleansing shares some characteristics with genocide/the Holocaust, so too does Trump bear similarities to other strongmen, a category in which fascists like Hitler and Mussolini belong, as do Orbán, Erdogan, Putin, and their ilk. That Trump maintains his support by engaging in explicitly divisive appeals designed to pit groups against each other — particularly but not exclusively ethnic groups — also, of course, bears some similarity to what fascists did.

And, of course, Trump is undermining various norms and institutions of democracy. But this doesn’t make him a fascist, which means much more than these things. Indeed, I almost think calling Trump “fascist” gives him too much “credit” — he isn’t strategic enough, ideological enough, or ambitious enough. And as bad as things are today, we are still not in 1930s Germany.

But alongside these historical and intellectual reasons, I also don’t like applying the term fascist to Trump for practical reasons. If Trump was a fascist and we were in a situation akin to Germany in 1932 or Italy in 1921, certain kinds of actions would be justified. But we are not, and they are not. And that remains important to stress, even though that does not mean downplaying the real threat Trump and the version of the Republican Party that is backing him represents to our country.

I think Trump often engages in what the political science literature refers to as “ethnic outbidding.” Even more fitting, in my view, is the term “negative integration” — a strategy of unifying a coalition by whipping up fear/hatred of purported enemies. Bismarck was the classic practitioner of the negative integration strategy.

As for Trump overall, I would still prefer referring to him as an illiberal populist or right-wing populist. He has a lot in common with the right-wing populists roaming around Europe today.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, professor of Italian and history, New York University

Trump certainly uses fascist tactics, from holding rallies to refresh the leader-follower bond to creating a “tribe” (MAGA hats, rituals like chanting “lock them up,” etc.) to unleashing a volume of propaganda without precedent by an American president. Yet the political cultures that form him and his close supporters are not fascist, but reflect a broader authoritarian history. Paul Manafort and Roger Stone worked for [Congolese dictator] Mobutu Sese Seko and [Philippine President] Ferdinand Marcos before Trump, and Manafort also worked for Putin. They worked on Marcos’s 1986 election that was widely denounced as fraudulent.

Trump’s role models include leaders like Erdogan and Putin who are not exactly fascists, but something more: authoritarians, or strongman rulers who also use virility as a tool of domination.

I also favor authoritarian over fascist as a description for Trump because the former captures how autocratic power works today. In the 21st century, fascist takeovers have been replaced by rulers who come to power through elections and then, over time, extinguish freedom.

Jason Brownlee, professor of government, the University of Texas at Austin

Of course Trump’s detractors are free to use whatever terms and epithets they like.

I would not say the traditional idea of fascism fits Donald Trump in 2020 any more than it did before he took office. When historians and political scientists do a full accounting of his actions and statements as president, I do not think fascism will figure prominently in their analyses. The prototypical fascist leaders — Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, [Austrian Chancellor] Engelbert Dollfuss — not only pursued right-wing policies, they also built-up mass-mobilizing parties and paramilitary organizations with the goal of sweeping aside alternative movements and establishing single-party dictatorship. I would tend to describe Trump’s brand of politics differently, and I would place him in different company.

Trump is a celebrity-turned-right-wing politician. He acts as a consummate demagogue, fabulist, and ultranationalist, and he appears to have a strong inclination for nepotism and kleptocracy. His efforts to use the presidency to finance his lifestyle and enrich his family resemble the schemes of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. In addition to profiting from his time in office, Trump, like Marcos, has challenged constraints on executive authority without investing resources into a sustainable political organization.

In other respects, Trump’s style of politics recalls portions of the career of former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Like Milošević, Trump has promoted a very hierarchical, ethnically based ultranationalist vision that endorses violence against out-groups but without building up a single party the way interwar fascists did.

Jason Stanley, Jacob Urowsky professor of philosophy, Yale University

When I think about fascism, I think about it as applied to different things. There’s a fascist regime. We do not have a fascist regime. Then there’s the question of, “Is Trumpism a fascist social and political movement?” I think you could call legitimately call Trumpism a fascist social and political movement — which is not to say that Trump is a fascist. Trumpism involves a cult of the leader, and Trump embodies that. I certainly think he’s using fascist political tactics. I think there’s no question about that. He is calling for national restoration in the face of humiliations brought on by immigrants, liberals, liberal minorities, and leftists. He’s certainly playing the fascist playbook.

My definition is of fascist politics, not of a fascist regime. I think most of the other [fascism scholars] are just talking about something else. They’re talking about regimes. Toni Morrison in 1995 said the United States has long favored fascist solutions to national problems. Toni Morrison is talking about “fascist solutions.” She’s not talking about fascist regimes. She’s saying the United States has long favored fascist solutions in a democratic state, which I completely agree with: targeting minorities, mass incarceration, colonialism, seizing indigenous land. All these things are things that impacted Hitler. My work is based in the United States — it’s based in the movements that affected European fascism: the KKK, Jim Crow, the anti-miscegenation law, slavery, Indigenous genocide, the 1924 Immigration Act and similar US immigration laws that Hitler lauds in Mein Kampf.

If you’re only worried about fascist regimes, you’re never going to catch fascist social and political movements. The goal is to catch fascist social and political movements, and fascist ideology, before it becomes a regime.",2016-05-23 01:30:00
598,To satisfy the demand for seafood. ,http://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/appetite-for-fish-is-turning-the-ocean-into-a-floating-pig-farm/,"Let’s face it, most people are entirely unaware of the methods used to produce the food they eat every day. There might be a sort of idyllic image of farm involved somewhere, but by and large, the reality of how food – especially meat, dairy, eggs, and fish – gets to the table is shrouded in mystery. Awareness of the type of facilities where animals are raised is increasing, as more consumers actively seek out labels like “pasture-raised” and “cage-free” thinking they are in some way superior. But in the case of fish, things are a little less clear.

In recent years, wild-caught and farm-raised has become a distinction between various types of fish found in the grocery store, but can most frequently be seen attached to salmon. The average American consumes two pounds of salmon a year, around two-thirds of which comes from farmed sources in China, Norway, and Canada. While wild-caught is largely self-explanatory, what exactly does farm-raised mean in the context of fish, mainly salmon?

Floating Farms

Around 40 percent of all fish consumed annually, are raised on aquafarms which can either be land-based or ocean-based. Land-based farms raise thousands of fish in ponds, pools, or even concrete tanks, where ocean-based aquafarms house fish in isolated cages either off-shore or in the open water.

In both cases, fish are overstocked and have little space to swim or display their natural behaviors, creating an extremely stressful environment. Around 40 percent of aquafarmed fish will die before they are harvested. And with good reason. Stocking thousands of fish in a small amount of space and feeding them protein pellets (ironically made from other fish) doused with antibiotics and chemicals, such as PCB, understandably makes for highly polluted water. If you’ve ever had a fish and seen what it looks like when you forget to clean their tanks for a few weeks … you can start to fathom the idea.

Daniel Pauly, professor of fisheries at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, likens aquafarms to, “floating pig farms.”

Fish take in water through their gills to breathe, so the quality of the water they live in is very important. The water that aquafarmed fish are raised in has high levels of ammonia, nitrate, nitrites, and suspended solids. It is not uncommon that groups of fish will become infested with parasites that feed on the gills, organs, and blood of fish. Bacterial infections also run rampant. While this contained land-based facility is incredibly detrimental to the fish living on farms, when you move this to an ocean-based farm … that impact literally seeps into the surrounding environment. With thousands of fish residing in an enclosed space, there is inevitably a lot of waste being produced. This waste breeds bacteria that consume oxygen, creating low-oxygen zones. Low oxygen levels not only trigger a stress response in the aquaculture fish, but it has serious ramifications for the surrounding ocean ecosystem. Ocean-grown fish are also fed pesticides in an attempt to limit the amount of algae that grows on nets, meaning toxic copper sulfate is released into the oceans. Add antibiotics into the mix and you get factory-farmed fish superbugs. Essentially, we’re creating the perfect storm for an environmental disaster … all for the sake of having salmon on demand. The Future for Fish Sadly, despite the threat that aquaculture can pose to the ocean, many see this as the only way for us to maintain our fish supplies given that global fish stocks are on the decline. According to a study conducted and published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, 80 percent of global fish stocks are “fully- to over-exploited, depleted, or in a state of collapse.” If this trend continues then it is predicted the oceans will be all but empty by 2048. That is only 32 years away – but can we really justify the damage occuring due to aquaculture as a solution? As Nil Zacharias, Co-Founder and Editor-in-Chief of One Green Planet said, “We can’t expect to feed ourselves by draining our oceans of fish while simultaneously dumping trash into the very waters from which we source our food. Something has to give. The reality is that in the developed world, we don’t need to eat seafood.” All it takes to put an end to the harmful practice of aquaculture and start to heal the damage wrought on the world’s fish population is one choice. By leaving fish off the menu for a year, you can help keep 225 fish in the ocean and lower the demand for, as Professor Pauly put it, “floating pig farms.” The fact is, if our oceans die, we die – so it’s never been a better time to #EatForThePlanet.

599,"No, it's safer than ever. ",http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/20/aviation/air-travel-safety/index.html,"(CNN) — As officials continue to investigate what happened to EgyptAir Flight 804, many travelers can't help but question the risks they face when boarding their next flight.

Is it becoming unsafe to fly?

Just the opposite, say analysts.

As we move towards the second half of 2016, it's shaping out to be one of the safest years in recent aviation history.

""We are ahead of the 10-year average with eight accidents and 167 fatalities compared to the average of 10 accidents and 205 fatalities,"" aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas, editor of Airlineratings.com , told CNN.

Analyzing the data

Experts say measuring the number of crashes or deaths alone isn't an accurate way to determine safety. You also have to factor in the overall amount of aviation traffic.

According to data released by the International Air Transport Association , more than 3.5 billion people flew safely on 37.6 million flights (31.4 million by jet, 6.2 million by turboprop) in 2015.

In a report released earlier this year, AirlineRatings.com said that 2015 was a safer year for aviation than the previous 12 months.

It cites Aviation-Safety.net data that tallies 16 air accidents with 560 fatalities -- below the 10-year average and an improvement on 2014 when there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities.

""Flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5% of today's number,"" said the report.

There were two high-profile air travel incidents in 2015.

In March, an Airbus A320-211 operated by budget carrier Germanwings crashed into the French Alps killing all 150 people on board.

It later transpired that pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was identified as having suicidal tendencies, had caused the crash deliberately.

In October, 224 people were killed when a Russian Metrojet Airbus A321-231 broke apart shortly after takeoff from Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport in Egypt.

The disaster was claimed as a bomb attack by terror group ISIS. Investigations are still ongoing, but initial intelligence reports also pointed the finger at terrorism.

Ranking airline safety

Every year, AirlineRatings.com puts out a list of the world's safest airlines

The rating system takes into account audits from aviation's governing bodies and lead associations, as well as government audits and the airlines' fatality records.

It also examines airlines' operational histories, incident records and operational excellence.

According to the site, 148 of the 407 airlines it surveyed have the top seven-star safety ranking, but almost 50 have just three stars or less.

If an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and/or crew members it will automatically lose a star from its safety-rating rankings.

EgyptAir has a product safety rating of 5/7.",2016-05-21 17:30:00
600,Louisiana ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/05/21/this-state-is-about-to-become-the-first-where-targeting-police-is-a-hate-crime/,"The Louisiana legislation has been referred to as “Blue Lives Matter” — a phrase popularized in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, which exploded following the fatal 2014 police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo.

Black Lives Matter activists have protested what they deem as excessive force by police, and they have called attention to specific instances in which police shot unarmed civilians.

But those who respond with “Blue Lives Matter” argue it’s officers who are under assault — that criticism of police fosters animosity toward law enforcement. In Louisiana, there were eight line-of-duty deaths among law-enforcement officers in 2015, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.

Louisiana House Bill 953 faced little opposition from lawmakers; the House passed it 91 to 0, and the state Senate approved it 33 to 3. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), the son of a sheriff who has indicated that he plans to sign HB 953 into law.

Some states have floated proposals similar to the Louisiana legislation, and a bill proposed in Congress would amend federal hate-crime law to include officers as a protected class.

“Talking heads on television and inflammatory rhetoric on social media are inciting acts of hatred and violence toward our nation’s peace officers,” Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said in a statement. “Our members are increasingly under fire by individuals motivated by nothing more than a desire to kill or injure a cop.”

In 2015, 124 officers died in the line of duty, according to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund. The number of officers fatally shot declined, falling to 42 from 49 a year earlier, while the overall number of deaths increased because of more traffic accidents and job-related illnesses.Fatal shootings of officers has decreased over the previous few decades — from an average of 127 in the 1970s to 57 yearly between 2000 and 2009.

But many officers and their relatives have said they feel greater tension with the increased attention to fatal shootings by police.

Louisiana state Rep. Lance Harris (R), who authored the hate-crime bill, has pointed to high-profile cases in arguing for his bill.

According to the Advocate, Louisiana’s largest daily newspaper, Harris cited the brazen and deadly ambush of two New York police officers in December of 2014 and a drive-by shooting that wounded a firefighter that same month in Florida.

“We have a pretty extensive hate-crime law right now, but I believe we should add firefighters and policemen,” Harris said, according to the Advocate.

No other state includes police officers as a protected class under hate-crime laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But at least 37 states — including Louisiana — have enhanced penalties for assaulting police officers.

In some states, hurting a police officer can be an “aggravating factor” to an assault or battery charge. And in many states, killing a police officer can be an aggravating factor or circumstance, making it a crime eligible for the death penalty.

Edwards, the Louisiana governor, is expected to sign the “Blue Lives Matter” bill this week.

According to the Advertiser, the Edwards family “has produced four generations of Tangipahoa Parish sheriffs,” including current Sheriff Daniel Edward, the governor’s brother.

“As the son and brother of a sheriff, I have the greatest respect for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect our communities, state and nation,” Edwards said in a statement. “Police officers and firefighters often perform life-saving acts of heroism, oftentimes under very dangerous circumstances, and are integral in maintaining order and civility in our society.

“The members of the law enforcement community deserve these protections, and I look forward to signing this bill into law.”

There has been criticism of the measure outside of the state Capitol. The New Orleans chapter of activist group Black Youth Project 100 has called on Edwards to veto HB 953, arguing that citizens, not police, are under assault.

“By treating the police as specialized citizens held above criticism and the laws they are charged to enforce, we lose our ability to exercise our First Amendment right,” the organization said in a statement. “Including ‘police’ as a protected class in hate crime legislation would serve to provide more protection to an institution that is statistically proven to be racist in action, policy, and impact.”

The organization highlighted high-profile deaths of civilians in Louisiana, including that of a handcuffed Victor White III. Officials in 2014 said the 22-year-old shot himself with a gun while in the back seat of an Iberia Parish sheriff’s deputy’s car.

The regional director of the Anti-Defamation League said it’s not wise to add occupations to hate-crime protected classes. “It’s really focused on immutable characteristics,” Allison Goodman told the Advocate. “Proving the bias intent for a hate crime for law enforcement or first responders is very different than proving it for someone who is Jewish or gay or black.”

The change to Louisiana law would mean those convicted of committing felony hate crimes against police officers could face a maximum fine of $5,000 or a five-year prison sentence. A hate-crime charge added to a misdemeanor carries a $500 fine or six months imprisonment.",2016-05-21 15:17:21

Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report’s authors warn.

Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called ‘superbugs’ such as MRSA develop.

Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further. In the UK, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock.

The report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former Goldman Sachs Asset Managemet chairman Lord Jim O’Neill. The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK.

Lord O'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is 'absolutely essential' (PA)

It calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: “to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.” Among his recommendations, Lord O’Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use.

The report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050.

✕ Antibiotics crisis is global

Lord O’Neill said of the findings: “My review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. The actions I’m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now… to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face.”

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the report’s recommendations, saying: “Lord O’Neill’s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is. It is not just a threat to health but also to the world economy. Apart from the moral case for action, the economic cost of failing to act is too great to contemplate.”

Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, who previously warned that the UK is facing an “apocalyptic scenario” over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as “challenging.”

Antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, stopping infections. They transformed medicine when they were first used early last century and have contributed to the near eradication of a number of serious conditions including tuberculosis and syphilis. An estimated 40 million antibiotics are prescribed in the UK every year, of which the health regulator Nice claims 10 million are unnecessary prescriptions.",2016-05-20 10:30:00

""Jackson is a beautiful city with a wide variety of trees and other pollen-producing plants that create higher than average pollen scores when compared to other municipalities around the country,"" Alex Burgess, spokesperson for AAFA, told weather.com.

Though the number one spot may have stayed the same from last year, the rest of the top 10 saw a shakeup. Syracuse, New York, climbed to third place on this year’s list after ranking 20th in 2015. Providence, Rhode Island, and Buffalo, New York, also make appearances in this year’s top 10.

""We were surprised by Syracuse and Buffalo jumping into the top 10,"" Burgess said. ""Spring pollen levels in both cities were much higher than those recorded in other major U.S. metropolitan areas, but Buffalo experienced a significant reduction in the number of certified allergists compared to last year, which may have influenced lower than expected medication utilization.

Although there has been a trend over the last few decades of the spring allergy season inching up on the calendar, Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York and an ambassador for AAFA, told weather.com that the presence of El Niño this winter and the wet, mild winter weather much of the country saw can result in a stronger allergy season.

""In any year with an El Niño phenomenon, we expect certain areas of the country, particularly in the South, to be plagued by lots of rainfall and precipitation,"" Dr. Clifford Bassett said. ""Each year it’s different. If you look at the aerobiology, you have a lot of different pollen areas. There’s a lot of cities [in the South] that are hit hard each year during the spring allergy season.""

And Burgess agrees. ""Certain parts of the country appear to be experiencing higher than average pollen counts while others have shown lower counts,"" which could be thanks to the presence of El Niño, he said. ""Generally speaking, the United States has experienced a warmer than typical winter coupled with late winter precipitation that has created an earlier pollen season than typically seen. Pollen counts are on the rise around the country and individuals who experience seasonal allergies need to be proactive and meet with their allergists to prepare a plan to address their symptoms.""

According to KrebsonSecurity, websites exist that can read the barcode on your boarding pass and then hack your personal information — including your phone number, frequent flyer number, and info about all future flights you book through the same number. That means they can then change your seat on your flight, cancel future flights, and even reset your account PIN entirely. Yikes.

605,San Bernardino. ,http://www.laweekly.com/news/heres-the-most-dangerous-city-in-california-6938087,"When asked to name the most dangerous place for crime in California, Compton, L.A.'s Eastside or the East Bay might come to mind.

You'd be wrong.

The most dangerous city in the Golden State when it comes to crime, police presence and other “community factors” such as poverty, the high school graduation rate and comparatively low police budgets, is in the Inland Empire.

It's San Bernardino.

That, at least, is according to the Southern California law firm of Graham Donath, which commissioned a report that crunches the numbers and gives us a list of California's most dangerous cities.

San Bernardino, a Great Recession–embattled town that's in bankruptcy, doesn't have the highest crime rate. Oakland and Stockton are worse when it comes to serious, violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and assault), the analysis found.

But when all the factors were calculated, including unemployment, police per capita and even the number of days in a year when the high temperature was higher than 80 degrees, San Bernardino is your winner, the Donath report says.

The city, for example, ranked in the top 10 for municipalities with the lowest investment in law enforcement. It also ranked in the top 10 for those “community factors” we talked about.

All across this great state there's a lot to be desired when it comes to fixing lawlessness, however.

The analysis notes that all of its top-10 cities had a poverty rate of nearly 15 percent (14.5) or greater. That includes Los Angeles, where about one in five people (21.2 percent) lives in poverty, according to the report.

San Bernardino's poverty rate is pegged at a whopping 30.6 percent.

The analysis cites the high cost of living as a possible pressure point for crime. We don't need to tell you that housing costs in L.A. are out of control.

“One explanation for high poverty levels in California cities could be the rising cost of living with stagnant wages,” the report says. “The poverty has actually grown in the state since 2007, and this could be because the increased cost of living is sending people into debt. It’s also encouraging people to leave or discouraging them from moving to the state.”

Los Angeles, by the way, ranked 19th on the dangerous cities list.",2016-05-18 16:00:00

But as they did, they started vomiting, one after the other, in quick succession. They were rushed to the local hospital, Dawn reported, where they only became sicker. Then, one by one, they started dying. By Thursday of that week, 12 members of Hayat’s family were dead, among them eight sons, a daughter and three grandchildren.

At the same time, several dozen others who had purchased sweets from the same Tariq Hotel and Sweet Shop, also took horribly ill and were rushed to the hospital. By this week, 19 more who had consumed the sweets were dead.

The tragedy became a great mystery.

Rameez Bukhari, a senior police officer from the local district, suggested that a worker at the shop “inadvertently” added pesticide to the laddus mix. “There was a pesticide shop close by which was being renovated, and the owner had left his pesticides at the bakery for safe keeping,” Bukhari was quoted as saying by Gulf News.

“A baker may have used a small packet in the sweet mixture,” he said, but added that police were awaiting the results of laboratory testing.

The Chief Minister of Punjab paid a visit to the village, assuring the locals there would be a thorough investigation.

Local health officials shut down the shop and sent samples to a laboratory in Lahore.

Friday, Dawn and other news outlets reported that the mystery was solved. Authorities finally tracked down the alleged cause of the mass poisoning when the younger brother of the sweet shop’s owner confessed that he had spiked the sweets with a pesticide. He wanted “to teach him [his brother] a lesson,” he reportedly told police.

The 18-year-old, identified as Khalid Mahmood, reportedly claimed his brother had “tortured him” and “insulted him on every trivial thing,” according to Pakistan’s SuchTV.",2016-05-17 22:34:22

Washington CNN —

At first glance, the National Vietnam Veterans Foundation is a roaring success. According to its tax filings, the charity has received more than $29 million in donations from generous Americans from 2010 to 2014 for what it calls on its website “aiding, supporting and benefiting America’s veterans and their families.”

But look a little closer on those same filings and you can see that nearly all of those donations have been cycled back to telemarketers, leaving less than 2 percent for actual veterans and veterans’ charitable causes.

That’s why Charity Navigator, one of the nation’s largest and most influential charity watchdog organizations, has given the charity a “zero” out of four stars for those same four years.

“It’s a zero-star organization and you can’t go lower than that,” says Michael Thatcher, Charity Navigator’s CEO. “They don’t have an independent board of directors, they actually don’t even have a comprehensive board of directors – only three members on the board at this point in time and some of them are family. So one can say, is this representative of an independent board? It’s not.”

The charity’s most recently filed tax return, for 2014, lists a catalogue of expenses paid for by donations: including $133,000 for travel, $21,000 for unnamed “awards”, $70,000 for a category described as “other expenses” and even a little more than $8,000 for parking.

Charity president works at VA

The CEO and founder of the National Vietnam Veterans Foundation, himself a veteran, is J. Thomas Burch, who is also a federal employee working as an attorney for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Burch is deputy director in the VA’s Office of General Counsel, where he pulled down $127,000 in salary in 2014. That’s the same year he drew a salary of $65,000 as head of his “zero-star” charity.

A VA spokesman told CNN Burch’s position at the veteran’s charity is not a conflict of interest “per se”. But the spokesman added the VA is now “reviewing” the situation and that the agency’s Office of Inspector General is handling that review.

When contacted by CNN, Burch asked that we not contact him at his job at the Department of Veterans Affairs, but he refused to answer phone calls placed to his home. CNN tried to confront Burch as he drove home from work in a black Rolls Royce, but upon seeing a CNN camera crew, Burch gunned the Rolls Royce down his suburban Washington, D.C. street and disappeared.

The charity’s vice president, David Kauffman, said in an email that the NVVF was responsible for “feeding homeless and unemployed veterans by donating to food banks, sent personal care kits to hospitalized veterans and donated blankets, hats and gloves to homeless centers.”

According to the charity’s tax filings, though, it accounted for about $122,000 in cash donations to veterans, out of more than $8.5 million raised in donations in 2014. That is less than 2% of the charities cash donations being used to support veterans and their families.",2016-05-17 10:00:00

609,$116.8 billion. ,http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/16/investing/saudi-arabia-us-debt-ownership-revealed/index.html?sr=fbCNN051716saudi-arabia-us-debt-ownership-revealed0653AMVODtopLink&linkId=24579110,"One of the biggest mysteries in global finance was just revealed: How much U.S. debt Saudi Arabia owns.

Saudi Arabia stockpiled $116.8 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March, the Treasury Department announced on Monday, ending four decades of keeping the figure secret.

That makes Saudi Arabia the 13th largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, though well behind the $1 trillion-plus owned by China and Japan each. The Saudi figure was first reported by Bloomberg News based on a Freedom of Information Act request.

Unlike with most other major owners of U.S. debt, the Treasury Department kept Saudi Arabia's precise holdings secret since the 1970s. Saudi's holdings were lumped together with that of other oil exporting nations, including Venezuela and Iraq.

But that policy ended on Monday as the Treasury Department disclosed precise holdings by specific countries that were previously grouped together. A Treasury official told CNNMoney the move was made following a review aimed at trying to provide more ""comprehensive and transparent"" data.

The new Treasury report also revealed that the Cayman Islands, a country of less than 60,000 people, owned $265 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March. That's the third-highest sum in the world and a reflection of the nation's status as a major tax haven. The Cayman Islands does not have a corporate tax, encouraging multinational companies to store vast sums of money there to avoid taxes.

Likewise, Bermuda, another popular tax haven, is sitting on $63 billion of U.S. debt. Previously both the Cayman Islands and Bermuda were lumped together in a group of Caribbean banking center nations.

It is possible that Saudi Arabia owns even more U.S. debt than what was revealed on Monday. That's because Saudi Arabia's central bank listed owning $587 billion of foreign reserves as of March. Typically, central banks park the majority of their foreign reserves in U.S. Treasuries. In other words, the numbers don't really add up.

One possibility: Saudi Arabia could be taking a page out of China's playbook. Many analysts believe China owns U.S. debt through custodial accounts in Belgium, a relatively tiny country that listed owning over $154 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March.

Related: Who owns America's debt?

The Saudi mystery had taken on greater significance in recent months. Since the end of 2014 the Saudis have burned through more than $130 billion of foreign-exchange reserves -- most likely including U.S. debt -- to help cope with the crash in oil prices. The Treasury Department said Saudi Arabia's U.S. debt holdings of $116.8 billion are down from $123.6 billion in January.

Additionally, rising tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia led the kingdom to make a recent shocking threat. Sources told CNN in April that Saudi Arabia threatened to sell off American assets if Congress passed a bill that would allow 9/11 victims to sue foreign governments. A Saudi source at the time told CNNMoney that the kingdom was ""serious"" about this threat.

Dumping a vast sum of U.S. Treasuries at once could cause the securities to tank, potentially destabilizing global financial markets. It could also severely hurt Saudi Arabia's own finances, leading many experts to conclude the threat was empty.",2016-05-17 08:15:00

611,They don't feel like their leadership skills are being developed. ,http://www.businessinsider.com/why-millennial-employees-are-quitting-2016-1?utm_content=buffer1f2db&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer,"Two-thirds of millennials plan to leave their current organization by 2020. Flickr/Erin Kelly New research finds two-thirds of millennials plan to leave their current organization by 2020. One-quarter see themselves elsewhere within the next year.

While you could argue that young workers have always been inclined to job hop (and millennials are less inclined to do so), their reasons for restlessness may have changed.

Young workers' latest gripe? Insufficient opportunities to develop their leadership skills.

That's according to the fifth annual Global Millennials survey, cited on Bloomberg, for which Deloitte reached out to nearly 7,700 working college-educated professionals in 29 countries.

As many as 63% of respondents said their leadership skills are not being fully developed.

And it seems to be a key reason behind their willingness to leave: While 71% of those likely to leave in the next two years are dissatisfied with how their leadership skills are being developed, that number drops to 54% among those who are planning to stay beyond 2020.

As Punit Renjen, chief executive officer of Deloitte Global, told Bloomberg, young workers' pursuit of leadership skills even at the expense of switching jobs is a new phenomenon.

Perhaps it has something to do with the recent trend of flattening organizations, which was highlighted in The Washington Post. In an effort to cut costs, organizations have removed levels of bureaucracy, which means there's not much of a corporate ladder to climb anymore.

""The biggest driver of disengagement is people feeling like they're stuck in a job, and there's nothing for them there,"" one expert told The Post. ""It's easier to quit your company and find a new job than find a new job within your own company.""

Restoring some semblance of a corporate ladder may require a good deal of structural reorganization. In the meantime, managers can take small steps to help their employees develop into leadership positions.

The Wall Street Journal recommends creating mentoring programs in which workers are paired with more senior employees at their company. You can also rotate your employees through different jobs, so they gain new knowledge and expertise.

As for individual employees, US News & World Report suggests being proactive instead of waiting for a leadership position to open up.

If you work for a large company, you can speak to someone in human resources and ask what you should be learning to reach the next level. You can also volunteer to take charge of a particular project, so that management recognizes your capabilities.",2016-05-17 06:30:19

In Australia, there are only a few brands of milk, butter, and bread. Milk generally has one ingredient (you know, milk), the cheese isn't fluorescent orange, and bread does not come in a can. In America, options for a single product type barely fit into one aisle. It was my first major experience of culture shock —which can feel like a hurtful reminder that you're not ""home"" anymore.

During one of my first Christmases in America, I remember watching intently as my sister-in-law pulled out a cylinder from the fridge, cracked it open, and scooped sections of white goop onto a baking tray. A few minutes later, steaming rolls emerged.

""It is so frustrating here. Nothing is easy. Nothing is efficient. To pay rent, you have to use a check? I have never written a check.

I started seventh grade in the US and several of the kids had braces—the type with wires going across both upper and bottom teeth with a metal holder in front of each tooth. They looked almost like robots. I didn't actually find out what they were until maybe two years or so later, because I didn't have the language skill to ask about them initially. To me, teeth were just what you had. If you had good teeth, you had good teeth. Bad teeth, then bad teeth. It didn't seem like you could move your teeth like that.

It's the same thing with schools—just big rolls of paper towels for when you spill something. But honestly, when I went to Korea last year, I noticed that things have changed. They now have paper towel disposals in a lot of bathrooms."" — Chandra Edwards, 27, financial analyst, South Korean

""Food-wise, I noticed us all getting these round faces from the bad food we ate. We did not realize it, because it was the standard and you think because it's advertised and readily available it can't be bad for you.

Then, once we got here, we ate those corn dogs almost every day for lunch, little pizzas for snacks, and sugary cereals for breakfast."" — Ben van den Heever, 32, founder of Brooklyn Biltong, South African

""I was hugely shocked by all the street harassment. And as a queer woman, I didn't realize that I had to police myself in certain areas here. I thought NYC was supposed to be such a gay city, and it is if you're in Manhattan or Chelsea. When I first moved here I remember my girlfriend and I were kissing on the street outside of our apartment in Bushwick and a group of teenagers started yelling and jeering at us. It was kind of scary and very confusing. I've learned not to hold hands or display affection in certain neighborhoods because of it.

613,"Delegate allocations rules were abruptly changed, benefiting Clinton.
",http://www.salon.com/2016/05/16/what_the_hell_just_happened_in_nevada_sanders_supporters_are_fed_up_and_rightfully_so/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=socialflow,"Chaos erupted at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday as supporters of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed over the awarding of the state's 35 pledged delegates. Clinton edged Sanders in the Nevada caucus on Feb. 20th (52.6 percent to 47.3 percent). On April 2, however, the state party held its Clark County convention and Sanders mobilized more delegates than the Clinton campaign (1,613 to 1,298), which swung the delegate count in his favor.

At the state convention this weekend, the final step in the process, Sanders supporters hoped to secure the lion's share of the remaining 12 delegates. Instead, the delegate allocation rules were abruptly changed and Clinton was awarded 7 of the 12 delegates. State party chair, Roberta Lange, told caucus-goers that the “ruling by the Chair is not debatable; we cannot be challenged and I move that...and I announce that the rules have been passed by the body.” Predictably, a chorus of boos followed and the convention was forced to end on a frenzied note.

What happened in Nevada is likely to happen elsewhere. The perception that the DNC has thrown its institutional support behind Clinton has only deepened the internal divide within the party. The Sanders wing is pissed off, and rightfully so.

The establishment support for Clinton was apparent in the superdelegate gap. Superdelegates are a noxious device to begin with, but they're part of the process and, however objectionable Sanders supporters find them, no rules have been broken on that front. In New York, however, where the process wasn't so much rigged as designed to make it uncommonly difficult for non-incumbents or Democratic challengers to compete are problematic at best, particularly in this climate.

Then there's the Hillary Victory Fund, which has become a massive fundraising vehicle for the Clinton campaign. The HVF was created by the DNC and Clinton's super PAC Hillary for America as a means of raising funds both for the Clinton campaign and down-ballot races across the country. Individuals can give over $350,000 to the joint committee if they donate the maximum amount to Clinton, the DNC and the state parties. Federal elections laws, however, do not allow individual donations to specific candidates to exceed $2,700.

The problem, though, as Politico reported two weeks ago, is that Clinton, aided by the DNC, appears to be skirting this rule and funneling large-dollar donations back to her campaign via the HVF. “The victory fund,” the report indicates, “has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but almost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who controls the committee.” At best, this is a violation of the spirit of the elections laws and, more importantly, an affront to Democrats supporting Bernie Sanders.

It's not at all surprising – or wrong, to be fair – that establishment Democrats would support Hillary Clinton. Clinton is a party veteran and a known commodity. She's been at the center of Democratic politics for decades. Sanders, on the other hand, has been an independent for much of his career in the Senate, though he's caucused with the party for years. Sanders is also well to the left of mainstream Democrats, which is part of his appeal with primary voters.

But the Democratic establishment can maintain neutrality in this process without compromising their preferred candidate. The fact is, Clinton has received at least 2.5 million more primary votes than Sanders. She was – and is – likely to win the nomination. There's no need to rig the process or skew the rules in her favor – doing so only adds to the suspicion that the process itself is undemocratic, which is ruinous to the party's long-term viability.

",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/sophie-gr-goire-trudeau-prompts-debate-in-canada-after-asking-for-more-help-a7031781.html,"The wife of the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has prompted an intense national debate for saying she needs additional staff to help her manage her public duties.

Sophie Grégoire Trudeau told a French-language newspaper based in Quebec that she was keen to do more but she was overwhelmed with work and struggled with just one aid.

“I’d love to be everywhere but I can’t,” she told Le Soleil. “I have three children and a husband who is Prime Minister. I need help. I need a team to help me serve the people.”

Ms Grégoire Trudeau, a 41-year-old former television presenter, said she had been inundated with requests from charities to promote their causes since becoming Canada’s “first lady” but it was not possible for her to respond to everyone.

“It’s hard to choose, because it’s touching when people ask for your help,” she explained. “People really lay out their suffering in some of the letters that I receive. I tell myself: ‘I’ll try to send a message that will reach as many people as possible’.”

Her comments have prompted an onslaught of criticism from opposition politicians who argue she is detached from reality. Conservative Canadian MP Candice Bergen drew attention to the fact the former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's wife, Laureen, had managed with just a single aide. While new democrat MP, Niki Ashton, said she was disconnected from the wider Canadian public.

“Hearing statements like that certainly does not speak to the reality that Canadian women face and the kind of struggles that, you know, that they’re undertaking day in, day out,” Ms Ashton said. “Certainly the kind of statements we heard from the prime minister’s wife, you know, speak to that disconnect with the reality that Canadian women face.”

The issue has been fiercely debated on social media, with the hashtag #jesuissophie and #prayforsophie trending and there has been an onslaught of column pieces exploring the divisive issue.

""If you think Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau shouldn't have help because she 'doesn't have a job', you might want to Google the word 'misogyny',"" wrote one Twitter user.

“Instead of sexist remarks #sophiegregoiretrudeau deserves acclaim + extra help for standing up for women!” added another.

But the majority of Twitter users have been less sympathetic to her situation.

“Dear Sophie when you seek recognition for doing charity, it is not charity at all,” wrote one user.

While another said, “I get she's the PM wife + has demands of her time, but think of any other Cdn woman you know, we all do. And we all deal with it”.

The Prime Minister’s Office have said they are exploring various options for Ms Grégoire Trudeau, including hiring a second staffer for her.",2016-05-16 12:30:00

618,"""Walk in like you own the place"". ",http://www.businessinsider.com/former-yum-ceo-david-novak-shares-best-career-advice-for-20-somethings-2016-5,"Yum Brands cofounder and former chairman and CEO David Novak. Hollis Johnson

During his tenure as CEO of Yum Brands from 1999 to 2015, David Novak turned a PepsiCo spinoff into a global leader in the fast-food industry through brands like Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut.

Today, it has 41,000 restaurants across 125 countries and a market capitalization of about $33 billion.

Novak is retiring this month from his role as Yum's executive chairman, but he took time to speak with Business Insider about the lessons he's learned throughout his career.

As he illustrates in his new book, ""O Great One!,"" he considers recognizing great work at Yum to be the foundation for his success, and he advocates that all leaders follow suit.

While it's up to managers to recognize their employees, the employees themselves can boost their chances of being recognized by working to become integral to their company from their first day on the job. It's why he tells all 20-somethings just starting their careers, ""When you go into your job, act like you own the place.""

Entitled 22-year-olds aren't going to win any friends at a company, but Novak isn't recommending that young employees behave arrogantly. Rather, he recommends they integrate themselves into their companies sooner rather than later.

""Don't just go in and do your job,"" he said. ""Think about what your coach ought to be doing, or the CEO ought to be doing. Take as broad a perspective on the company as possible, and always take a company view, not just your job view. And that will demonstrate to other people that you've got potential.""

He said that early in his own career, he would seek opportunities to have conversations with his bosses and tell them three things he'd be working on if he were in their place. It was a bold move for a young employee, but he kept it graceful by making them expressions of his own interest in his team's goals, rather than something patronizing.

Novak said that neophytes needed to understand that the way to get people to teach you is to simply ask them questions, since ""everybody likes to talk about what they've learned.""

He recommended that new employees ""go find the four or five people in the company that you know are really highly respected and go have lunch with them,"" and then ask them about their own careers and how they learned to succeed at the company.

""And they'll take it as a compliment if you seek them out because they're viewed to be so successful and you've heard a lot of good things about them,"" he said.

If 20-somethings can be driven and confident yet also respectful and open to input, they'll become recognized at the company, Novak said. And they shouldn't worry about feeling aggressive.

""A lot of people think that if you do stuff like that you're political,"" he said. ""You're not political. You're just wanting to learn. As long as you're never sacrificing your integrity, don't worry about anything. Just learn.""",2016-05-13 21:54:03

",https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/cliven-bundys-cattle-are-allegedly-still-roaming-unchecked-i?bffbnews&utm_term=.gkNN0w1MJ#.dvQWrQZ7P,"Rob Mrowka, a scientist with the Center for Biological diversity, said the Bundy cattle are essentially ""feral,"" roaming at will over hundreds of thousands of acres — including far outside the range where long ago they were permitted. (Bundy stopped paying his grazing fees in 1993, meaning the cattle were technically trespassing anywhere on public land after that point.)

The area occupied by the cattle is also one of the driest in the U.S., Mrowka said, and the cattle end up out-competing the tortoise for limited food.

""The problem is that the cattle are out there constantly and get first dibs,"" Mrowka added.

Bundy is currently behind bars awaiting trial after being arrested in February at Portland airport on charges stemming from his role in the tense 2014 standoff with federal officials near his Nevada ranch.

Cliven Bundy's lawyer Joel Hansen told BuzzFeed News that there are still cattle on the range, and that ranching operations are being run by Bundy's wife and other women in the family while the rancher awaits trial.

Hansen disagreed that cattle harm tortoise habitat.

""The environmentalists say that it's bad for the tortoise if you have cattle on the land, that's false,"" Hansen said.

",http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/israel-forces-palestinians-jerusalem-160504063755669.html,"Jerusalem – Tucked away on a steep, potholed street in Sur Baher, a suburb in the southeastern hills of Jerusalem, Sarah Ali Dwayat’s apartment sits empty.

On the front porch, a large banner bears the photographs of five teenagers from the neighbourhood currently imprisoned by Israel. One of them is her 19-year-old son, Abed.

The group stands accused of throwing stones at Israeli vehicles on a highway, allegedly causing the death of a driver, after clashes between police and Palestinian youths last September, on the eve of the Jewish New Year.

The trial is still going on, but already some of their family members have been forced from their homes – the victims of new measures ostensibly aimed at deterring alleged Palestinian attackers.

“When we got the confiscation notice, we took all the furniture out, and now it’s scattered with friends and neighbours,” Sarah said, pushing back a metal sheet covering one window to sneak a look inside.

Doorknobs to the home have been broken off, and entrances sealed with melted metal plates. Sarah, a widow for 15 years, and her 24-year-old daughter have moved to a smaller apartment in the same area, provided by a neighbour as a goodwill gesture.

Sooner or later, they will have to start paying rent again, Sarah acknowledged – and with property prices sky-high in Jerusalem, they will not be able to afford it. “We had just started renovation work. Abed had found a job and had started to help. We are still paying the debts,” Sarah, 59, told Al Jazeera.

“When they came to seal the house [last month], a soldier told me, in Arabic, that it was to send a message to others, so they wouldn’t carry out more acts of terror.”

READ MORE: Israeli home demolition reach record high

Since last October, tensions have boiled over into violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the blockaded Gaza Strip.

During this period, the Israeli army has killed at least 206 Palestinians, including protesters, bystanders and alleged attackers, while 33 Israelis have been killed in stabbing and shooting incidents.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a series of measures directed at alleged Palestinian attackers and their families, including the demolition or sealing of attackers’ homes and the revocation of permanent residency status for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem.

Munir Nusseibeh, a human rights lawyer and director of the Community Action Centre at al-Quds University, believed that Sarah’s son and two of his co-accused, Muhammad Abu Kaf, 17, and Mustafa Atrash, 18, were “test cases”. Israel’s interior minister issued a decision to strip all three of their Jerusalem residency in January, a move that is now being appealed in court.

“They are the first at risk of residency revocation for throwing stones, and the first whose families have been displaced from their homes for throwing stones,” Nusseibeh told Al Jazeera.

Allegiance, which allegiance? We pay tax to the Israeli municipality, and we get nothing in return. Did Yigal Amir get his citizenship revoked for killing the prime minister of Israel? by Abu Walid, father of Mustafa Atrash, who is on trial over stone-throwing allegations

A letter to Abed’s lawyer from the Israeli Interior ministry states that “a permanent residency status in Israel is based on a material connection between the resident and the state” and that it “requires basic commitment and loyalty in view of the fact that residency, and all the more so permanent residency, is not a status which only grants rights without any obligations”.

When Israel occupied and unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, Palestinians were designated as “permanent residents” rather than citizens of the state, a status akin to that of migrants in a foreign country. Since then, over 14,000 have had their residency revoked.

Over the years, the criteria for revoking residency have broadened. Two decades ago, Israel’s interior ministry revoked the residency of Palestinians who lived abroad for seven or more years, or who obtained residency or citizenship status in another country.

But after the Oslo Accords, a new policy was introduced whereby Palestinians would lose residency rights if they established their “centre of life” outside of Israel – such as in the West Bank or Gaza. Some 11,000 out of the 14,000 had their residency revoked under this policy.

READ MORE: East Jerusalem suffocates under harsh Israeli siege

In 2006, three elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council had their Jerusalem residency revoked on new grounds: “breach of allegiance to the state”. Their case is still pending before the Supreme Court.

“No one was arguing that these parliamentarians posed a specific security threat to Israel, but rather it was because of their political belonging that they decided to cancel their right to live in Jerusalem,” Nusseibeh said, noting that there are 13 known cases of residency revocation under the allegiance criteria.

“If the Supreme Court approves the residency revocations in the 2006 case based on breach of allegiance, this will make a new important precedent – it will be the first time that the Supreme Court approves revoking residency based on political, rather than security reasons,” Nusseibeh said.

“All Palestinians in Jerusalem will be at risk of residency revocation according to the allegiance criteria, because Palestinians in East Jerusalem see the occupation as temporary and Israel as a foreign occupying power.”

Abu Walid, the father of Mustafa Atrash, was indignant at this policy. “Allegiance, which allegiance? We pay tax to the Israeli municipality, and we get nothing in return,” he told Al Jazeera. “Did Yigal Amir get his citizenship revoked for killing the prime minister of Israel?” he added, referring to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a right-wing Israeli extremist in 1995.





Abir Joubran-Dakwar, a lawyer for the Israeli human rights organisation Hamoked who is working on the Sur Baher case, noted that there are a number of specific criteria under which citizenship can be revoked, including “breach of allegiance”.

However, this does not apply to residency, she said: “A person who has his citizenship revoked becomes stateless, but the interior ministry will still have to give him a permanent residency status.”

Israel’s interior ministry did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the matter.

At the end of April, Israel’s attorney-general temporarily suspended the revocation in the Sur Baher case, until the Supreme Court comes to a decision in the 2006 case.

Human rights groups, including B’Tselem, have argued in the past that home demolitions, denial of building permits, restrictions on family reunification, and the building of the separation wall are all among the variety of methods used by Israel to forcibly displace Palestinians and maintain a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, in violation of international law.

“I believe the aim of this policy is to add a new method for the displacement of Palestinians in East Jerusalem, to be able to displace even larger numbers,” Nusseibeh said. “That’s our concern.”",2016-05-12 22:59:49

624,"It depends on where it's purchased. If it's purchased in Florida, then it's an in-state private purchase and would not be subject to a background check. ",http://ti.me/1T8RD1F,"The gun George Zimmerman used in 2012 to kill Trayvon Martin showed up on two separate online gun sales sites Thursday. But do online sales mean it wouldn’t go through a standard background check? That all depends on where it’s purchased, gun experts say.

Zimmerman initially listed the handgun that he used to kill Martin, a black 17-year-old in Sanford, Fla., on gunbroker.com, along with a note saying he would dedicate some of the proceeds to fighting “BLM violence against Law Enforcement officers,” presumably referring to the Black Lives Matter movement. But the gun sale website quickly removed the listing. Zimmerman then posted a listing for the gun on unitedgungroup.com, a similar online gun sales site. No matter which site Zimmerman uses to sell the gun, the purchaser’s location will determine whether a background check will be performed.

Gun sales websites aren’t allowed to sell guns directly to people, but instead bring buyers and sellers together. They also don’t conduct background checks or directly transport firearms to purchasers, says Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who studies gun policy.

“There is no such thing as an online gun sale,” Volokh says, referring to the limits placed on sites that arrange gun sales.

If the gun is purchased by somebody in Florida, where Zimmerman lives, it would be considered an in-state private purchase and would not be subject to a background check. Neither federal nor Florida law requires checks for in-state transactions.

“What’s often misunderstood is that this is some kind of loophole,” says Dave Kopel, an associate policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. “But it’s the same rules for online sales. It varies state by state, but in most you can sell private-to-private within the state.”

Read more: Broker Refuses to Auction Off George Zimmerman’s Gun

If the purchaser is from out of state, however, federal law requires that the seller ship the firearm to a licensed gun dealer in the purchaser’s state. That dealer will then run a background check in the same manner as any other gun purchase from a dealer.

“This works quite routinely in far less lurid contexts,” Volokh says.

Zimmerman was acquitted in Martin’s death in 2013 but has had a series of run-ins with police since then. He was arrested on assault charges in January 2015 and has had multiple confrontations with Matthew Apperson, who was accused of shooting and injuring Zimmerman in May 2015.

625,"Maybe, but probably not. They have to do ""research."" ",http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/12/did-pope-francis-just-pave-the-way-for-women-priests.html,"ROME — At what was meant to be a love fest for 900 nuns at a meeting of the International Union of Superiors General at the Vatican on Thursday, Pope Francis didn’t just rock the boat; he may have created a tidal wave.

During the question and answer session of the meeting, one of the sisters at the conference brought up the fact that women had served as deacons in the early church.

Then, according to the National Catholic Reporter, she asked the pope, “Why not construct an official commission that might study the question?”

Francis then said that he had discussed the matter of those early deaconesses with a professor several years earlier, but that he remained unclear about what role they actually served.

“What were these female deacons?” Francis said he asked the professor, according to the National Catholic Reporter. “Did they have ordination or no? It was a bit obscure. What was the role of the deaconess in that time?”

Then, apparently thinking out loud, he endorsed the idea.

“Constituting an official commission that might study the question?” Francis asked. “I believe yes. It would do good for the church to clarify this point. I am in agreement. I will speak to do something like this.”

The pope went on to address other concerns from the group of sisters, and dole out advice like “take a deep breath” and “get more sleep” and then revisited the topic. “I accept,” the pope said. “It seems useful to me to have a commission that would clarify this well.”

Deacons in the Catholic context act as a sort of priest-lite: they cannot perform the sacrament of the Eucharist (give holy communion) and they don’t have to take the vow of celibacy; in fact many are married. But they can perform any number of ministerial roles, from baptisms to funerals, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops website, which is something many of the world’s Catholics just might appreciate.

Quoting canon 1024 of the Code of Canon Law, Catholic website Crux points out that at the moment, “only a baptized male can receive the sacrament of ordination, so the law does not presently permit female deacons.” Crux editors then question whether Francis will change the law, which is within his powers as pope.

As exciting as this is for roughly one half of the world’s Catholic population (the female half), surely not everyone will be pleased at the idea of women nudging one step closer to the all-male clergy club that rules the Catholic Church.

Almost immediately, liberal priests tweeted their praise. Father James Martin, a prolific author priest from New York, tweeted that the news filled him with “immense joy” and that, “Women deacons would be able to baptize, preside at marriages and funerals, and preach at Mass. It would be an immense gift to the church.”

A more conservative priest tweeted, “Has @Pontifex forgotten about this 2002 study about diaconate where issue of women deacons was examined?” referring to a Vatican study that all but nixed the idea.

Even if the special commission Pope Francis promised today does pave the way to the ordination of women deacons, they may never have a hope in Hell of being allowed to enter the full priesthood. But they are certainly one step closer than they have ever been before.",2016-05-12 08:17:29

Only a year ago, a study out of Stony Brook University in New York found that age 60 should be considered the new middle age.

Not surprisingly, age plays a role in one's perceptions. Among those Marist respondents who are 45 and older, 63 percent are more likely than younger respondents to think of 65 as middle-aged. When it comes to those younger than 45, 49 percent believe 65 is old while 47 percent refer to it as middle-aged. For those under 30, 60 percent consider 65 to be old. The Marist poll involved 1,297 adults surveyed over the phone in late March.

Researchers have said that people are hitting middle age later in life simply because they are living longer than ever before.

On the opposite end of the list, the most unhappy country in the world is Burundi, followed by Syria, Togo, Afghanistan and Benin.

“There is a very strong message for my country, the United States, which is very rich, has gotten a lot richer over the last 50 years, but has gotten no happier,” said head of the SDSN Jeffrey Sachs. “For a society that just chases money, we are chasing the wrong things. Our social fabric is deteriorating, social trust is deteriorating, faith in government is deteriorating.”

The wordsmiths over at the Hillary Clinton campaign just can’t help themselves from coming up with insipid, potentially self-destructive names for their main opponent, a man whose appearance alone lends itself to an infinite array of much more spectacular nicknames.

During a campaign stop at an elementary school in Oakland, California, on Friday, the Democratic presidential candidate unveiled her new jab at Donald Trump, who is the Republican presumptive nominee: The “presumptuous nominee.” She went on, according to ABC News:

“Their presumptive nominee, otherwise called their presumptuous nominee has made it really clear he basically said wages are too high in America. And that’s why he doesn’t think we need to raise the minimum wage. And I gotta tell you I ask myself all the time, who he is talking to?”

Tack on five letters to an already jargon-y word, and voilà! You’ve made an ineffective meme. But at least, mercifully, this may signal a departure from that other nickname beloved by the Clinton campaign.",2016-05-08 02:54:29
