Set five years after the events of Revenge Of The Sith, Jedi: Fallen Order follows the story of Cal Kestis. On the run from the Sith, Kestis must discover ancient Jedi secrets in order to find a list of force-sensitive children. Jedi Fallen Order follows a similar gameplay structure to titles like Dark Souls, with a touch of platforming as well.

There are several other games available to those with an Amazon Prime subscription, including; Total War: Warhammer and Two Point Hospital. A full list of all the available games can be seen below. Some are specific to certain platforms, so you’ll need them in order to redeem the codes.

2,Dropzone. ,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-brings-back-a-classic-/1100-6475993/,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is bringing back one of the franchise's most chaotic game modes. This week's playlist update includes Drop Zone mode, which first debuted in 2011's CoD: Modern Warfare 3.

The team-based mode challenges players to hold objectives to win, with teams earning points by staying inside the designated...drop zone. The first team to reach the goal point total wins the match. The hook with Drop Zone is that killstreaks continually fall from the sky while you're holding the zone, which leads to some particularly turbulent gameplay.

A blog post by Activision offers a number of tips, tricks, and strategies for succeeding in Drop Zone, which is played across a variety of maps such as Crash, Arklov Peak, and Granza Raid.

Drop Zone originated in Modern Warfare 3, and it was subsequently featured in other Infinity Ward-developed titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. The mode will come to Modern Warfare at some point this week across PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

It's a big week for Call of Duty, as Warzone introduces a new way to play, while Infinity Ward will offer double XP for the weekend. Modern Warfare's Season 3 is currently underway, and you can check out the new maps in a dedicated playlist right now.",2020-04-15 05:56:06
3,Nepal. ,https://www.gamebyte.com/pubg-has-been-completely-banned-in-one-country/,"PUBG has been banned across the country and others look ready to follow suit.

Banned games come around every so often. Whether banned for their violence, their imagery or for their politics, it’s unfortunately a pretty common occurrence to see a country completely ban a game.

What’s not common is to see it happen to a game that’s as popular as PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, but it seems the battle royale has been banned in the country of Nepal.

Credit: PUBG Corp

Internet service providers were issued a warning from Nepal’s telecommunication authority earlier this week, and were told to block PUBG.

The instructions came from the Kathmandu district court.

Senior police official, Dhiraj Pratap Singh, told AFP [via Daily Mail]: “We sought an order from the court to ban PUBG after floods of complaints from parents, guardians and school organisations to block the game citing psychological impact on teenagers and students.”

Credit: PUBG Corp

The news comes following the death of a 16-year-old in India, who died by suicide after being told by his parents to stop playing PUBG in favour of his studies.

It’s not the first time that PUBG has been blamed for such heartbreaking news in India. Earlier this year, two men in their 20s lost their lives when absorbed in the mobile version of PUBG too close to railway tracks.

Some parts of India (more specifically, a number of cities in the state of Gujarat) have already banned PUBG after concerns of it encouraging violent behaviour and distractions from schooling.

Two dozen young people have since been arrested for violating the ban and playing the game.

In Nepal, anyone caught playing the game will now also face arrest, though the country has come under some criticism for banning the title instead of encouraging restricted play time or gaming addiction awareness.

What do you think about the ban? Will India be the next country to outlaw PUBG?

4,Conan exiles and Surge #StopClickbait,https://www.gamebyte.com/these-are-your-free-playstation-plus-games-for-april/,"Sony has revealed its line-up of monthly freebies available for PlayStation Plus subscribers, and it looks like April is going to be a fairly average month for PS players.

The first offering from Sony is Conan Exiles, which Sony describes with the following:

“Drawing inspiration from the classic barbarian tales, survival open world survival game Conan Exiles winds back the clock to the very dawn of civilization, casting you as a forgotten exile abandoned alone in the desert for crimes unknown.

“Starting out with nothing but a loincloth and your own two hands, you’ll have to explore this vast, hostile world, gathering materials, crafting tools and carving out a new life for yourself in a world filled with danger.

“Exploring a shared online space, you’ll have the chance to meet with other players, build settlements and bases together, and even raise your own armed fortresses as you advance your mission to dominate this brave new world.”

Your second freebie for April is popular RPG, The Surge, which comes from the creators of “brutal medieval action-adventure Lords of the Fallen,” and is described as “a challenging sci-fi spin on the hardcore RPG genre.”

Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with these titles. They’re actually really great games, but suddenly the Sony monthly freebies look very lonely…

It’s not been long since Sony decided to cut the cord with its PlayStation 3 and PS Vita monthly freebies, leaving us with just two free titles each month. Sob.

5,"Co Director, Tai Yasue had this to say about the lack of Final Fantasy characters:

""We had a lot of original characters. It's the conclusion of the Xehanort saga and we really wanted to concentrate on the main storyline of Kingdom Hearts, such as Sora and Roxas, for the example. They're having all these stories in other games and we wanted them to conclude.""
",http://epicstream.com/news/NicoParungo/Heres-Why-No-Final-Fantasy-Characters-Appeared-in-Kingdom-Hearts-3,"Ask anyone who has played it and you would know that Kingdom Hearts 3 was another great game from Square Enix. Sure, some would argue that it didn't live up to everyone's high expectations and the combat was a bit too easy, but as a conclusion to the Xehanort saga, it was well done. As we wait for the inevitable Kingdom Hearts 4, fans are still asking one question.

Where were the Final Fantasy characters?

Yeah, despite the game's foundation being built upon a crossover between Disney and Final Fantasy, we didn't get any characters from that legendary series, outside of the Moogles. Sure, there were Dissidia NT Toys, a giant Cactuar, and statues of Cloud and Auron, but no characters from the series appeared properly.

Speaking with Game Informer, co-director Tai Yasue had this to say about the lack of Final Fantasy characters:

""We had a lot of original characters. It's the conclusion of the Xehanort saga and we really wanted to concentrate on the main storyline of Kingdom Hearts, such as Sora and Roxas, for the example. They're having all these stories in other games and we wanted them to conclude.""

Fans are hoping we get to see some Final Fantasy characters in future DLC for the game. The secret ending also teased something Square Enix-related, but we won't spoil it here, though it's a franchise Tetsuya Nomura has worked on before (and isn't Final Fantasy).

Kingdom Hearts 3 is available now on PS4 and Xbox One.

Every Disney World in Kingdom Hearts 3 16 Images

Kingdom Hearts 3 Ultimania, the official companion book for the most recent Kingdom Hearts game, includes a special interview with director Tetsuya Nomura. Translated by Twitter user @lunesacree via KH13 , Nomura reveals why properties from Marvel and Lucasfilm weren't included in the game, and it mostly boils down to contract complications - the same reason why Mickey Mouse was barely in the first Kingdom Hearts “In order to change those [properties] into a game, contracts must be made with each company separately, and there are cases where other game companies already have contracts, so although the Disney Group has indeed added those [properties], incorporating them into Kingdom Hearts isn't so simple,” said Nomura.""That’s also the reason Mickey is in only one scene in Kingdom Hearts 1,” he continued. ""At the same time, another company was releasing a game that had to do with Mickey, so though we were denied his usage, we persisted and eventually got 'as long as you only have one scene, from far away, as a silhouette, with him waving his hand or something.' Since we had to make the best of the biggest [and only] chance we had, that's why that scene appears that way.""Though we really wanted to see Star Wars and Marvel in Kingdom Hearts 3’s DLC , these comments make it seem less than likely - though certainly still possible. Nomura previously confirmed that both free and paid DLC is in the works for Kingdom Hearts 3.

8,They believe that it is outdated. #StopClickbait,https://www.gamebyte.com/sony-admits-why-it-wont-be-appearing-at-e3-this-year/,"Sony said last year it won't be presenting at E3, and now we know why.

Sony shocked gamers when it announced last year that it wouldn’t be making an appearance at E3 2019. It’s the first time in E3’s 24-year-long history that Sony has decided not to present, and considering how close we are to the launch of next-generation consoles, it was a move that raised a lot of eyebrows in the community.

It seems like we’ve now gotten some clarity on the matter though, as Sony’s SIE Worldwide Chairman Shawn Layden opened up to CNET [via Destructoid].

Layden explained: “The world has changed, but E3 hasn’t necessarily changed with it,” referencing the way that E3 was set-up at a time before the internet.

When E3 was in its infancy, people got their gaming news from magazines rather the internet, and with instantly-available news via social media, it makes sense to say E3 is a little…old school.

Instead of E3, Layden said Sony will be doing things a little differently with Destination PlayStation.

He said: “We have an event in February called Destination PlayStation, where we bring all retailers and third-party partners to come hear the story for the year.

“They’re making purchasing discussions in February. June, now, is just too late to have a Christmas holiday discussion with retailers. So retail has really dropped off. And journalists now, with the internet and the fact that 24/7 there is game news, it’s [E3] lost its impact around that…

“With our decision to do fewer games — bigger games — over longer periods of time we got to a point where June of 2019 was not a time for us to have a new thing to say.”

So…does this mean Sony’s highly-anticipated exclusive titles, Death Stranding and The Last Of Us 2 won’t be here until 2020…?

Only time will tell!

That’s what I don’t get. In one sentence he says that E3 has lost its relevancy, then he says they aren’t pulling out of E3 forever. It’s almost like he’s being a petulant child about the fact Sony won’t be there this year and having a sly dig at the E3 and others that will be. — Reidzer N7 (@ReidzerN7) February 12, 2019

9,Erdrick from the Dragon Quest series. #StopClickbait,https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/12/16/super-smash-bros-ultimate-second-dlc-character-leaked-dragon-quest/,"For quite some time now, we've gotten our fair share of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate rumors revolving around the downloadable fighters coming to the hit game. We already know that Joker from Persona 5 is confirmed thanks to a recent trailer from the Game Awards, but the rest of the roster are still shrouded in mystery. Some of these rumors have suggested that particular favorites, from Banjo Kazooie to the Rhythm Heaven choir kids to Waluigi, are coming to the game. Nothing confirmed yet, however.

Now you can add one more to the list. A new leak has suggested that the second downloadable fighter for Ultimate is coming out of left field- a character from the Dragon Quest series.

The info comes from Persona Central (originally translated from 5Channel), which suggests that Erdrick, a long-time favorite in Square Enix's role-playing series, will be joining the party. The information is translated as follows:

Erdrick

Stage is Alefgard

Erdrick (Male) and Erdrick (Female), 2 colors each of Anlucia and the Dragon Quest XI Hero

Slime appears on screen with a skill

Achieved through active collaboration on Square's side

To the benefit of overseas marketing for the DQ series

The following image was also found, possibly cementing the idea that both male and female versions of Erdrick would be included within the game:

But, on top of that, the site has also reportedly found further information about Joker, including his themed stage in Ultimate, as well as the appearance of another character.

Joker

The stage is Mementos

Jack Frost appears on screen with a skill

Game director Masahiro Sakurai did make it clear that Ultimate's DLC roster would surprise fans, and Erdrick definitely falls into this category. And the worldwide appeal of Dragon Quest would make it fairly easy to crossover a character from that universe into this fighting universe.

That aside, do take this rumor with a grain of salt. 5Channel isn't exactly the most common news source out there; and while the details and image look to be fairly accurate, we've seen rumors such as this before where proposed leaks turned out to be unsubstantiated. At least, for now.

Would you like to see a character from Dragon Quest join the Super Smash Bros. universe? Or would you prefer someone from another Square Enix franchise? Lara Croft from Tomb Raider, perhaps?

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is available now for Nintendo Switch in both physical and digital form via eShop.

#StopClickbait",https://www.gamebyte.com/another-free-pc-game-available-today-on-epic-games-store/,"By now you should know that Epic Games is giving out a whole bunch of free games (two a month, to be precise) throughout 2019, and the next offering has just been confirmed.

The Epic Store, which you can access right here, has previously allowed people to play the likes of What Remains Of Edith Finch?, Super Meat Boy and Subnautica for the very-appealing price of free, and the next game is just as exciting.

From 24th January – 7th February you can download, play and keep the first JackBox Party Pack, just by signing up to the site. Thanks, Epic Games!

If you haven’t played this JackBox Party Pack or any in the series, it comes highly recommended from a lot of people on the GameByte team, and if you like weird and fun minigames then you’re going to enjoy this party game.

You won’t need to worry about playing with friends, as they’ll use their smartphones to access your game as you and your buddies compete for the win.

Last call! We’ve partnered with Giant Sparrow and Annapurna Interactive to offer ‘What Remains of Edith Finch’ for free on PC inside the Epic Games store until 11:59PM EST on January 24, 2019. Best of all, once you grab the game, it’s yours to keep! https://t.co/FyPvm38D89 pic.twitter.com/RE0AntmL9t — Epic Games (@EpicGames) January 23, 2019

If you still want Edith Finch, today is the last day you can grab it, so you’ll have to act fast!

The Epic Store is working hard to not just provide incentives for players, but for developers too.

The new-ish digital PC store hopes to pull game devs away from Steam by giving them 88% of the revenues, keeping just 12% for itself.

Right now, Steam usually takes around 30% of revenue from devs, meaning Epic Games would be seriously undercutting them with a move like this. With such potential savings for game developers, it’s easy to see why they’d want to publish their game on an Epic store page.

11,Soldier 76. ,https://www.fraghero.com/overwatch-reveals-one-main-characters-actually-gay/,"In a new short story, released very recently, Blizzard has confirmed that another character from the Overwatch universe is actually part of the LGBT community. The first member of the Overwatch cast to be confirmed as part of the LGBT community was of course Tracer. Now we know that a male character is actually gay. Soldier 76, also known as Jack Morrison, has been confirmed as a gay character.

The healing sniper from the game, Ana, finds a wounded Soldier 76 in the Cairo streets. She then takes him back to her hideout and speaks to him (as well as looked after him I assume). She then sees Soldier 76 going through a stack of old photos and one in particular catches her eye. The one that she spotted was an old one of Soldier 76 with a dark-haired man named Vincent. Here is what happens in the short:

“Vincent… I haven’t thought about him in years,” Ana said. “Still keeping a candle lit for him?”

Jack shook his head. “Nothing like that.”

“You’ve never looked in on him? You must have been curious. All the surveillance power in the world. I bet Gabe would have put a Blackwatch agent on him if you asked,” Ana said.

Jack glared at her.

“Okay, touchy subject.”

Jack laughed. “He got married. They’re very happy. I’m happy for him.” “Vincent deserved a happier life than the one I could give him.” Jack sighed. “We both knew that I could never put anything above my duty. Everything I fought for was to protect people like him… That’s the sacrifice I made.”

“Relationships don’t work out so well for us, do they?” Ana said, unconsciously running her thumb over where her wedding ring used to be.

PewDiePie makes no secret of his issues with YouTube as a platform, criticising it for its monetisation criteria, its changes to the algorithm and its tendency to push larger channels to the forefront.

With a bro army of nearly 80 million subscribers, Pewds has an incredible platform for change, as proved by his charity efforts over the years. In a recent video, he questioned why his version of the failed YouTube Rewind 2018 vid didn’t appear in the Trending pages, and his subscribers are pretty riled up too.

",https://www.fraghero.com/streamer-drops-truth-people-watch-gaming-livestreams/,"First came the Let’s Plays, then came the livestreams and now, if you don’t have a favourite Twitch star or keep up with the latest eSports news then you’re sort of…out of the loop.

But why did livestreaming get so popular? For the big dogs like Ninja, the format has earned them millions and millions of dollars, and streams are the perfect place to talk to like-minded fans of games that you yourself enjoy.

One Twitch streamer believes that’s exactly why people enjoy livestreams – because they can go and talk about games.

In a recent stream, Twitch user A_Seagull said to his fans that he believes there just isn’t a place for people to talk about games anymore.

Using the example of Overwatch, he says: “People don’t talk about the game anymore. I watch a lot of stuff. There are probably less than 10 Overwatch YouTubers.

“The only place for discussions in most games is 1) Reddit 2) YouTube 3) Twitch…turns out most of the Twitch streamers are already quitting…

“Who actually talks about the game anymore?”

It might not be a valid point for all games, as Reddit forums such as the r/Reddeadredemption forum have been blowing up since the game’s release – but in a few months, it’s likely that will see a significant drop in conversation.

Check out the clipped video of the stream above and let us know your opinion.

",https://www.gamebyte.com/fans-are-completing-spider-man-without-noticing-this-incredible-audio-detail/,"Spider-Man has been blowing fans’ minds since it released last week and its impressive attention to detail and design seemingly knows no bounds.

Kotaku writer and Spider-Man fan, Kirk Hamilton recently tweeted a clip of his playthrough of the game in which you can clearly hear a difference between ‘tired’ Spidey and ‘not-so-tired’ Spidey, with the former sounding distinctly out of breath if he’d been overexerted before speaking.

So for those of you wondering if we recorded #spidermanps4 open-world Spidey dialogue twice– yes, we did. One “resting” take, one “exerted” take. Programmers exposed a variable to Wwise allowing the game to switch between dialogue assets, depending on the player state. — Jon Paquette (@jon_paquette) September 8, 2018

The lead writer for the game, Jon Paquette, recently took to Twitter to recognise the audio as fans were left wondering how it had been done.

So for those of you wondering if we recorded #spidermanps4 open-world Spidey dialogue twice– yes, we did. One “resting” take, one “exerted” take.

“One “resting” take, one “exerted” take. Programmers exposed a variable to Wwise allowing the game to switch between dialogue assets, depending on the player state.”

Before the audio was recognised not too many people had picked up on the very subtle yet incredibly effective detail, and fans are loving the clarification.

“This attention to detail is so incredible,” one Twitter user responded.

17,They have stopped supporting the PS2. #StopClickbait,https://www.gamebyte.com/japan-has-officially-given-up-on-a-playstation-console/,"It’s a sad day for us all, as Japan has finally decided to give up on one iconic console.

Kotaku reports that the Sony Interactive Entertainment’s aftercare service for the PlayStation 2 in Japan is coming to an end.

Looking back at all the good times we had, it’s hard not to feel a little emotional at the fact that it’s all over. Grand Theft Auto radio stations shaped many of our music tastes as we grew older. How many of us would have known all the words to Depeche Mode – Personal Jesus by the time we were 10 if not for the PS2?

The console launched on March 4, 2000 in Japan, and hasn’t been in production since 2012. Despite all that, it’s still the best-selling game console ever and Sony Japan respected its brilliance by continuing to service the PS2. Sadly, six years after it came off the production line it is now over.

The company has put out communication to PS2 owners, asking them to fill out online forms to have their machine serviced one last time. The cut-off date? August 31.

Any consoles that arrive at While the console has been out of production since 2012, Sony Japan continued to service to the game machine, keeping it alive. Sony is now pulling the plug. As IT Media reports, Sony Japan asked PS2 owners to fill out online forms by August 31 to have their consoles fixed one last time. PS2 that arrive at the PlayStation Clinic service center in Iwate Prefecture after September 7 will not be serviced. Customer support for the PS2 also officially ended on August 31.

So there we have it. Rest in peace, PlayStation 2. March 4, 2000 – August 31, 2018.",2018-09-03 15:49:32

Square refers to a piece of paper; I had it represent menus or documents and made it pink. The circle and X represent ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision-making and I made them red and blue respectively. People thought those colours were mixed up, and I had to reinforce to management that that’s what I wanted.”
Not really clickbait, but still an interesting read. Although the article does ramble a little. 😊",https://www.gamebyte.com/why-does-the-playstation-controller-have-triangle-circle-x-and-square/,"Since video games have existed, there’s been the need to make your avatar on the screen actually do things.

At first, this was done with simple knobs and joysticks. When video games moved from the arcades to the living room, this seemed to be the way things were going to stay.

But it wasn’t.

And although many controllers share similarities, there’s one that stands out for a very specific reason, and that’s Sony’s PlayStation controller. Why do the PlayStation controllers have a triangle, circle, X, and square?

On top of that what inspired the other design choices for the gamepad?

To find this out, we have to jump back to 1983 and look at Nintendo. After finding success in the arcade and digital toy side of gaming, with the likes of Donkey Kong and their Game and Watch handhelds, they decided to enter the home console market. They used inspiration from some of their Game and Watch digital toys for their control pad. The name of that home console? The Nintendo Entertainment System.

The simple gamepad of the NES helped set it apart from the competition. A four-way directional pad on the left, two buttons on the right, and start and select buttons in the middle. It was easy for anyone to pick up and understand. Something proven by a four-year-old me and my 60-year-old grandma on numerous occasions.

The NES controller set a new standard for the games industry, and as new systems were introduced from competitors the D-Pad quickly became a mainstay, with the face buttons varying in letters and numbers. Nintendo then introduced the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and evolved the gamepad again, in a way that still sees its influence to this very day. Two more buttons were added on the right, and two buttons were added to each shoulder at the top of the controller.

The time of the Super Nintendo was also the time of a collaboration between Nintendo and an electronics company you might have heard of – Sony.

Sony was working with them to make a CD-ROM accessory that would be compatible with the SNES, and began work on it all the way back in 1988 – two years before the SNES even existed. At the Consumer Electronics Shows in June 1991, Sony announced the collaboration to the world. At the show the very next day, Nintendo announced their partnership with Philips to make a CD-ROM accessory. A surprise to everyone… especially Sony.

This created an obvious conflict between Sony and Nintendo and spurred Sony on to make their own console, the PlayStation, which would release in 1994. The story of Sony and Nintendo’s conflict is something for another day, but an important thing to establish, as we explore why they adopted the shapes of triangle, circle, X and square.

In Super Mario World, an enemy called a Magikoopa, or Kamek (depending where you’re from), tries to attack you by firing some magic. How does that magic appear on screen? In the shape of a triangle, circle and square, with what looks suspiciously like an X as well.

Some believe this why Sony chose the shapes they did, but unfortunately that’s not the case – they have some very specific reasons for their shapes and colours.

How do we know this? From a 2010 interview with Sony engineer Teiyu Goto. Teiyu designed the PlayStation controllers and, whilst being interviewed in 2010, explained that the shapes and their colours were not just random, but something deeply thought out. He said:

Other game companies at the time assigned alphabet letters or colours to the buttons. We wanted something simple to remember, which is why we went with icons or symbols, and I came up with the triangle-circle-X-square combination immediately afterward. I gave each symbol a meaning and a colour. The triangle refers to viewpoint; I had it represent one’s head or direction and made it green. Square refers to a piece of paper; I had it represent menus or documents and made it pink. The circle and X represent ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision-making and I made them red and blue respectively. People thought those colours were mixed up, and I had to reinforce to management that that’s what I wanted.

The controller has evolved over the years to include thumbsticks, vibration, and more, but the shapes and a lot of the layout has stayed the same, making them a key part of PlayStation’s brand identity and much more than a bunch of random shapes.",2018-08-17 05:20:29
19,Climbing towers to reveal areas and points of interest. Such a long article 🙄 it’s an alright read if you want to know a detailed description of the first 2 hours of Spider-Man. ,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-ps4s-first-few-hours-have-everything-we/1100-6460894/?ftag=GSS-05-10aab8d&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_content=5b6e03dd9ac5640001976654&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook,"If you love reading superhero comic books, there's a good chance that a huge part of what makes them so attractive is the way they explore the regular lives of the people behind the masks. Matt Murdoch's daily courtroom drama and neighborhood philanthropy, Jessica Drew's demanding commitments as a single mother, and the multifaceted teenage dramas of Kamala Khan and other student-aged heroes are equally as engrossing as the crime-fighting adventures of their alter-egos. And when work and life clash, that's when things really get interesting.

The more mundane side of superhero stories are rarely explored in video game adaptations, and that's something Insomniac Games is openly talking about as a major point of difference in their take on Marvel's Spider-Man. In the game's first two hours, which I experienced during a recent preview tour, a large chunk of time was spent controlling Peter Parker in his mild-mannered form, as well as Mary Jane Watson. Insomniac explained that this ratio was largely indicative of the rest of the game, with major themes of mentorship and trust as something that would be explored with and without masks.

That might sound like a far cry from what's been shown of Insomniac's Spider-Man up to this point, but these moments hit all the right notes for us. The game's version of Peter Parker falls on the dweeby side, despite being old and having almost a decade of crime-fighting expertise. He's messy, perpetually behind on his bills, and isn't currently in any kind of romantic relationship, all thanks to his second life. But he takes time to visit his Aunt May and catch up with acquaintances, as well as work on science projects as part of his day job, hoping he can do some good there, too.

I spent a large part of Spider-Man's opening hours exploring interior environments as Peter, making and listening in on small talk, looking at photos and reading documents to fill out back-story, and performing research experiments--there are Pipe Dream and pattern matching minigames that can earn you experience points to spend on Spidey abilities. Mary Jane, an investigative reporter in this universe, has her own separate narrative motivations that quickly become entwined in the rest of the plot. Her interactive segments have their own mechanics, which Insomniac told us would grow and evolve over the course of the game. For more on Mary Jane's section in these opening hours, be sure to read Kallie's in-depth account.

But as happy as I was to see a big emphasis on the Peter and MJ side of things, I still had just one thing on my mind, being this was my very first first hands-on: Whether or not Insomniac's Spider-Man was going to surpass the memories I had playing Treyarch's open-world Spider-Man 2 for consoles, generally regarded as the best Spider-Man game to date, thanks to its phenomenal web-swinging mechanics. And it most definitely does, as we've previously reported. Insomniac's Spider-Man adheres strictly to the rule that Spidey's web lines need to attach to a structure, and that creates the wonderful sense of tangibility that is both essential to selling the experience, as well as creating a satisfying need for forethought when traversing New York City.

It works like this: R2 shoots out a web line, and pressing X while mid-swing will let you jump and gain height or distance, depending on where you are in your arc. Pressing X without being attached to a web line will let you perform a quick web zip, which propels you forward, allowing you to gain directional momentum without losing height, and is great for quickly changing directions. Finally, holding L2 will trigger a slowdown, allowing you to aim a cursor and hit R2 to create a direct zipline to that particular point (provided it's in range), and is a great landing technique that allows you to expertly perch on lampposts and other locations, just like a spider can.

Web swinging feels fantastic, and minor additions, such as hitting L3 to nosedive, using Circle + Triangle in tandem with the left stick to perform aerial tricks for experience points, and the motion blur when you pick up a large amount of speed, adds a lot to making the act of getting around town a pure joy. Even Central Park can be traversed by web-swinging, thankfully, so long as you pick a route with enough trees to latch onto.

Movement on the ground also feels suitably Spider-Man-like. Aside from using L2 and R2 to web zip from point to point, holding R2 acts as an Assassin's Creed-like parkour button, allowing you to easily clear obstacles, as well as run up and across the side of buildings. But if you need a break from thinking about how to get from A to B, Spidey can also just take the subway and fast travel to a different station.

The parkour button isn't the only inspiration Insomniac's Spider-Man takes from an Ubisoft series, though. In a move that took me completely by surprise, Spider-Man incorporates the archaic mechanic of tower reveals, that is, points of interest that you have to find, travel to, and solve a puzzle at in order to reveal a map of the immediate area, as well as the locations of other points of interests like side missions, challenges, collectables, and Far Cry-style outposts. Each district of Manhattan represented in the game--Chinatown, Greenwich, Financial District, Hell's Kitchen, Midtown, Upper West Side, Central Park, Upper East Side, and Harlem--has a number of towers hidden within them, which you're required to activate before you're even able to see where you're going on your minimap.

This is strange not only because the mechanic feels incredibly outdated--Ubisoft has moved on, their open-world franchises now focus on more organic discovery mechanics--but it just doesn't make characteristic sense. Insomniac has been pitching their version of Spider-Man as an experienced one, one that's been fighting crime in New York for nearly a decade, and it's incredibly puzzling that this Spider-Man hasn't internalized an intimate geographic knowledge of the city he protects. I don't believe him when he exclaims, ""I'm flying blind here!"" while swinging through world-famous Times Square, no matter what the tower MacGuffin might be.

Any activity revealed by towers can still be found by naturally stumbling across them, and minor Spider-Man 2-style randomly-generated events, such as car crashes and armed robberies, also can pop up unannounced, which is great to see. But the emphasis on using towers to reveal them just seems like a huge misstep, a puzzling addition that feels like unnecessary filler.

But there's still plenty of good filler in there, namely, the number of things you can stuff into Spider-Man's suit. As expected, you can unlock dozens of different Spider-Man costumes by earning experience and leveling up to gain access, and spending different tokens (earned through completing side content) to purchase them for use. Each suit comes with its own unique suit ability to assist you during the game's exciting, Batman Arkham-inspired combat system, but a nice feature is that once you own a suit, you can transfer its unique ability to a different suit you own.

For example, I immediately sought to don the Spider-Man Noir costume, which comes with the ability to stop enemies from calling backup (great for stealth approaches), but swapped that out for the Battle Focus ability from the Advanced Suit seen in the game's marketing materials. Battle Focus steadily increases your Focus meter, used in combat to heal and perform the game's cinematic takedowns. Other suits and abilities I saw included the Classic Suit (webs every enemy in sight), Scarlet Spider (creates holographic decoys), and the Spider Armor MK II (protects from bullet fire).

True to Peter's science background, you can also equip a number of unique combat gadgets, switching between them using a radial menu with L1, and upgrade their effectiveness over the course of the game. Aside from the standard web shooters, they include things like impact webbing to pin enemies to surfaces, spider drones that seek out opponents and fire energy, electric webs that stun, web bombs that are proximity triggered, web trip mines, concussive blasts, and a suspension matrix that suspends enemies in the air.

The game also has a skill tree for ability progression, featuring three branches with which to upgrade Spidey's combat and web swinging techniques. The Innovator branch focuses on web-based combat techniques, such as using webs to disarm gun-toting thugs and the ability to throw a larger variety of objects and enemies, while the Defender branch improves Spider-Man's general striking, evasion, and combo abilities, letting you earn bonuses for things like perfectly-timed dodges. Finally, the Webslinger branch largely lets you perform additional traversal moves, but also gives you access to Spidey's infamous web swing kick in combat. It also unlocks the aforementioned ability to perform tricks in mid-air for small amounts of XP and large amounts of style.

There are a number of references too, of course, found in dialogue, environment, and the game's backpack collectibles. But it's a range that can be appreciated by both casual Spider-Man fans (Spidey asking ""Should we kiss?"" to a hanging enemy), and fanatics (a mention of ""Nazis made of bees""). There were some nice interactive touches I loved: using the attack buttons around citizens lets you wave and give high fives, with some interactions giving you XP, and J.J. Jameson now hosts a podcast Peter listens to, but you can unsubscribe in the audio settings menu.

Insomniac's representation of the Spider-Man experience plays as good as it looks, at least in its opening hours. The web swinging and acrobatic combat are instantly satisfying, but it's also wonderful to see that there's a lot more to it--a significant focus on interacting as Peter Parker and Mary Jane (which we're hoping will continue to evolve into something great), a depth of progression options and combat abilities, and many minor, but exciting details that positively colored my short experience. The opening hours had me eager to play more--even just to have more time swinging around the city--but it also reinvigorated my excitement about the Marvel universe in general. I just wish I could forget about those towers.",2018-08-10 15:45:44

Speaking of Fortnite, dataminers have uncovered yet more information from the game’s latest patch.

There’s a tonne of new stuff coming to Fortnite (and really, when isn’t there?) including new game modes, cosmetic upgrades and weapons.

The latest rumours suggest we might be seeing two new sniper rifles enter play, along with new game modes which hopefully are going to keep the game as strong as ever.

The game’s developer, Epic Games, has been getting some flack recently after issues with bugs and items having to be pulled from the game came to light.

Playground Mode, shotguns, health items and more have all caused problems within the Fortnite community, so it’s a good thing Epic Games are pretty on the ball when it comes to patches and bug-fixes.

Fortnite is one of the biggest games in the world right now, with the free-to-play game’s Battle Royale mode taking the universe by storm.

Although not without its controversy, fans still can’t get enough of Fortnite. With so many regular updates from Epic Games, it’s hard to imagine this game is going anywhere anytime soon.

What are you most looking forward to seeing added into the game? Have you encountered any weird glitches in your games?",2018-08-08 14:00:42
21,"No dates announced. Everyone knows it’s gonna be free to play eventually, everything in this article is just speculation. ",https://www.gamebyte.com/fortnites-save-the-world-will-soon-be-free-for-everyone/,"Fortnite has just turned one year old, celebrating its birthday in style with a party Battle Bus, new challenges and cosmetic goodies which will soon be leaving until (presumably) the game’s second bday.

It’s difficult to remember a time before we’d all experienced the absolute joy of the free-to-play Battle Royale mode which rocketed the game to success.

But despite Fortnite being known as a “free” game, there are still some aspects of it that will expect you to cough up the cash – Save The World, for example.

Epic Games has previous told its many, many fans that Save The World will soon be at the same cost-free status as its Battle Royale mode, but all we knew was that it was a change planned for sometime this year.

Speaking to the Express, Fortnite’s Lead Systems Designer, Eric Williamson commented: “We’re still looking at a 2018 free release for ‘Save the World.’ Epic tried to be really generous with the content in Early Access packs, and there have been events and items that exclusive to this Early Access period already!

“We appreciate everyone who’s played and supported the game so far, and our philosophy is to do everything we can to show that to our players.”

We haven’t heard too much about the potentially free content since Williamson made this statement a few months ago, but as we’re nearly through with 2018, we can imagine we’ll be getting an update on the release sooner rather than later.

There was initially a lot of speculation suggesting that the launch of Season Five of the game could introduce the first cost-free Save The World mode, but that’s yet to happen.

Maybe next season, then?

While we wait there’s still a load of content coming to the game, including new skins, weapons and even a few new modes too.

That should be plenty to tide you over until Save The World is free, right?

Have you played Save The World, and how do you think it compares to Battle Royale?",2018-08-08 10:35:38
22,"Scarlet. The name is Scarlet. 

(Also, GameByte is trying to get back into clickbait, so, we might have more posting :D )",https://www.gamebyte.com/next-xbox-launching-in-2020-and-its-codename-has-people-talking/,"Gamers believe the successor to the Xbox One could be coming in 2020, and its development name is very unique.

Microsoft confirmed back at E3 this year that work has already begun on the new consoles from Xbox, and the fact that multiple versions of the console are coming has gotten fans very excited.

Now it looks like we’ve got a bit more info on the upcoming console launch, as multiple sources are claiming the consoles are being developed under the codename ‘Scarlett.’

Of course, it’s common practise for consoles to be developed with a name that eventually has nothing to do with the final product, but this hasn’t stopped fans from speculating what the name could mean.

According to reports on other consoles, past codenames have ranged from the sensible to the downright weird, meaning ‘Scarlett’ could just be a Microsoft in-joke, a reference to a game or even just a randomly selected name.

The Wii U was developed under the name ‘Project Café,’ the PlayStation was named ‘Orbis’ and the Xbox One went by ‘Durango.’

In some other exciting news, a report from Thurrott is claiming that ‘Scarlett’ will be launching in 2020.

Writing for Thurrott, Brad Sams says: “This past week, I was tipped off that the next generation Xbox was codenamed Scarlett and in an effort to track down if this information was accurate, I was able to view content that highlighted several unannounced Microsoft products that are coming in the next two years.

“Microsoft is planning for the next Xbox console release to arrive in 2020. But what is more interesting, is that Microsoft describes ‘Scarlett’ as a family of devices; meaning we may see multiple pieces of hardware released that year.

“That date may seem relatively close considering that the Xbox One X launched last year but Microsoft is aggressively moving ahead with hardware in the console space to shake up the industry. But what we don’t know is if this is a brand new set of devices or simply a more ‘powerful’ Xbox One that is again, fully backward compatible with all the content available today.”

He Tweeted: “I’m a MUSLIM and not Baptized. Please @EASPORTSUFC edit my after fight celebration. I have a lot of Muslim fans and you have to respect it.”

EA Sports isn’t the only one in trouble as Bethesda is suing Warner Bros after the latter released a new game that ‘clones’ their Fallout Shelter game, and even uses the same code.

Polygon reports that a suit was filed in a Maryland U.S. District Court. Bethesda alleges that Westworld, developed by Behaviour and released this week for Android and iOS, “has the same or highly similar game design, art style, animations, features and other gameplay elements” as their game.

They continued: “Behaviour breached its contract with Bethesda and utilised its restricted access to Bethesda’s intellectual property, including Bethesda’s copyrighted code, trade secrets, and other rights, to compress its development timeline, reduce costs, and quickly bring the Westworld mobile game to market, and offer players the widely popular gameplay experience found in Fallout Shelter.”

They also reckon that Behaviour used the “same copyrighted computer code” as their own game.

They also added that it “has the same or highly similar game design, art style, animations, features and other gameplay elements”

They’re right to be upset, and the situation raises a big question that it seems like no one wants to answer: Why didn’t anyone warn us not to play Fortnite on the PlayStation 4?

The issue is a problem moving in the other direction as well; if you play Fortnite on the Switch, you will not be able to access your account through the PlayStation 4. But very few players have bumped into that issue, as the Switch version of the game was only released earlier today.

The error message that Fortnite gives you when trying to play the game on the Switch after playing on the PlayStation 4 is rather icy, and sounds like Epic Games knew of the issue and wanted to make damn sure you understood that it wasn’t their fault.

“This Fortnite account is associated with a platform which does not allow it to operate on Switch,” the error message states. “Neither the Fortnite website nor Epic Customer Service are able to change this. To play Fortnite on Switch, please create a new account.”

Sony hasn’t gotten back to us. Epic Games gave us a “no comment,” even as the number of angry tweets about this situation pile up. Nintendo also declined to comment on the situation.

Epic Games itself provides a detailed FAQ about cross-platform play which indicates that the Switch and PlayStation 4 versions of the game won’t be able to interact, but nowhere does it say that playing the PlayStation 4 version at all means you can’t use your main account or any of the items you’ve purchased on the Nintendo Switch.

How the hell is this going on for so long without anyone explaining what’s going on? And if any of these companies knew this was going to happen, why were we never warned not to play the game on the PlayStation 4?

This whole thing is bad news for Sony. Despite no official statements about whose decision this was or who is responsible, a quick look around social media indicates that everyone blames Sony for the issue.

It’s not an unreasonable assumption, even if it’s based on speculation. We know Sony has kept companies from offering cross-platform play in the past. We know that Epic Games has made Xbox to PlayStation 4 cross-platform play available on Fortnite in the past. We know that Xbox’s social media team is having a good time dunking on Sony today. Whatever is actually going on, this makes Sony look like a spoiled child.

If Sony isn’t to blame for this situation, an explanation of that fact is hours overdue.

We all love to play Fortnite at the moment. The whole world can’t seem to get enough of the 100 man battle royale game. Many of those people, including you reading this, suck. But don’t worry we got you covered. Here is our list of how to improve at Fortnite BR.

Heading Straight to a Big City

The majority of Fortnite players tend to be extra greedy and jump out of the Battle Bus right above the biggest city they see on the map, but this is not such a great idea. In the first few minutes of the game you’ll probably not have enough weapons and ammunition to be able to get into fights with other people and this is why you should avoid heading straight towards a big city; and, instead settle for a more innocuous settlement that is partially deserted so that you can loot the houses at your own pace and without the fear that you’ll get shot at by enemies.

Overlooking Building Materials

We know that Fortnite is the kind of game where you’ll want go in all guns blazing but the end game is usually won by working with a plan in mind, and building structures is the best thing you could do to achieve success. Having a variety of good weapons and plenty of ammo are two very important objectives but building materials will prove to be vital during the stormy nights so you’ll always have to be careful and gather enough household resources if you want to be able to survive in the long run. All in all, in Fortnite, guns are great, but bricks and wood planks will also prove to be very handy in a pinch.



Using the Wrong Weapon

The assault rifle is the best all-around weapon in the entire game and even though you might get so attached to it that you practically glue it to your palms, it would be wise to take the other options that are in your inventory into consideration. For example, a pumpkin launcher, a shotgun and even some explosives will prove to be perfectly viable alternatives that will help you in situations when an assault rifle would probably fail. And here is yet another piece of advice: rapidly switching between weaponry is your definite lifesaving move in Fortnite, so by all means, practice until you become the best gunslinger in the game.

Forgetting to Build

The main advantage you have in Fortnite is that you can build your very own shield wherever you are, so when you get yourself surrounded by enemies and there is no way out, think outside of the box and put together a small shelter that you can get cover in. Forgetting to build useful structures is definitely one of the worst mistakes you could commit while playing this game and if you’re going to watch let’s plays done by well-prepared players you’ll see that they tend to put together buildings more often than they shoot.



Underestimating Sound

When you’re playing fast paced survival games, listening to environmental sounds is vital because in this way you can predict the direction an enemy is approaching from, or you can hear if there is a battle close to you. Thankfully, Fortnite has a very unique sound selection that is not only very easily recognizable but also loud and clear enough to give you all the necessary hints when it comes to engaging into combat with more than just the sense of sight. In conclusion, underestimating sound can turn out to be one of those apparently innocent mistakes that are in fact crucial to the outcome of your gameplay.

Not Sorting Your Inventory

There’s nothing worse than a messy inventory where weapons mix up with building materials, aiding kits and miscellaneous loot and we are not saying this because we are some kind of superior beings who are always tidy, however, in a game like Fortnite, when you need to switch between guns in a matter of seconds, you’ll surely want to not be pointing a piece of wood towards the enemy by mistake. All in all, keeping a clear head as well as a clean inventory are two of the easiest ways of avoiding small yet fatal mistakes that could get you killed.

Hope this has helped you!",2018-02-21 10:18:31
28,Dead Space.,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-next-free-pc-game-now-available-and-its-a-good/1100-6456765/,"Dead Space, the acclaimed 2008 sci-fi horror game from the now-defunct developer Visceral Games, is now completely free on PC. It is the newest ""On the House"" game from publisher Electronic Arts, and you can grab it right here from Origin.

As with the previous On the House titles, once you download Dead Space it is yours to keep forever. The only catch is that EA doesn't say when On the House titles cycle out, so if you're interested, you may want to grab the game right now instead of putting it off until later.

Dead Space was already in the Origin Access free game library on PC, so if you subscribe to that service you have been able to play the game at no cost for a while now. The game was also released on Xbox 360, and it is playable on Xbox One through backwards compatibility. The Xbox 360 edition is in the Xbox One EA Access library.

Dead Space was in fact the very first EA On the House freebie, kicking off the freebie campaign back in 2014. It appears to be the first title to have two runs in the On the House hopper.

In Dead Space, you play as a space engineer named Isaac Clarke who must fight all manner of ghastly creatures on a spaceship. Sequels Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3 were released in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey, who now lead Call of Duty studio Sledgehammer Games, worked on Dead Space before starting their own studio.

Dead Space 3 failed to meet EA's sales expectations. However, despite that, the publisher said in 2013 that the brand remains one that is ""close to Electronic Arts' heart."" However, with creator Visceral Games now shuttered, it remains to be seen if the franchise has a future at EA.",2018-02-15 14:30:23
29,"The Viking era. ""Assassin's Creed: Ragnarok"".",https://www.gamebyte.com/next-assassins-creed-could-be-set/,"The Assassins Creed franchise has been all around the world in many different settings. Here is where the franchise could be going next.

New concept art has been released for what might be the next Assassin’s Creed game and it has us wondering where the next Assassin’s Creed could be set.

Where will the next Assassin’s Creed be set?

Let’s look into where the next game could be set within the Assassin’s Creed franchise and see what kind of gameplay content could come from it.

It’s important to remember that the information in this post is so based on speculation and rumors so far, but with newly released concept art, it’s possible that these rumors could come true. If they are true, we could have a very exciting new Assassin’s Creed game on our hands.

Will The Next Assassin’s Creed Be Based On Vikings?

If recent concept art is anything to go by, the next game will be based on the Viking era. The next game has been rumoured to be called Assassin’s Creed: Ragnarok.

With the Viking era potential in mind, there are a lot of questions we have to ask about what gameplay mechanics the new game will have. I’ve tried to find answers to some of these questions below.

The Next Assassin’s Creed Game Will Have Naval Combat

If Ubisoft opt for the Viking setting, adding naval combat would make perfect sense. Naval warfare was always a big part of the Viking lifestyle. Thankfully, we already know that naval combat can work really well in Assassin’s Creed games.

Black Flag is the perfect example of how naval combat and sea exploration can expand on the Assassin’s Creed universe in an exciting new way. I’d absolutely love to see a return to this kind of gameplay in the next Assassin’s Creed game.

If rumours are to be true, you may once again be given the option to commandeer your own ship. Some speculation suggests that you’ll be pitted up against a rival Viking clan and will regularly be put into naval combat situations whilst exploring the deep sea.

Blending Stealth With The Typical Viking Archetype

Whilst Assassin’s Creed games can often be so different from one another, one element always stays the same throughout the franchise.

As the name would suggest Assassin’s Creed always implements some kind of stealth into the gameplay. Typically, you wouldn’t consider a Viking to be particularly stealthy – they’re often looked at as tough, heavy-hitting combatants.

It will be interesting to see how Ubisoft blend the stealth elements of past Assassin’s Creed titles into a Viking style game.

Interestingly, there is some history that suggests Vikings weren’t as brutish as one may think. In the past, Vikings would use a mixture of deceit and stealth to take down their enemies.

One thing that is important to note is that Vikings would often do anything they could to carry out attacks. Vikings were known to be ruthless, but that didn’t mean they were always running in head first to combat. Instead, Vikings were actually smart thinkers that’d use any means possible to get an edge in combat.

Perhaps if the new Assassin’s Creed game was set in the Viking era, we could see a variety of options for players to choose how they want to take out enemies. A variety of improvised weapons alongside different options for stealthy or non-stealthy approaches could be considered.

For when things get really tough, Ubisoft could add some kind of Bezerk combat mode that would make dealing with waves of enemies less challenging.

What Will Be The Backstory For The Next Assassin’s Creed Game?

In past Assassin’s Creed games, there have often been references to religion or the gods in some way or another. Usually, religion has played a big part of the story for past games in the franchise.

During the Viking era, many believed in the Norse gods. Could we some kind of reference to the Norse gods in the backstory for the next Assassin’s Creed game? I think it’s totally possible.

In the past, Vikings would also pillage religious sites and attack places that were particularly vulnerable.

The cause of their ruthlessness was often attributed to honoring a particular Norse god. Many believed that Vikings would attain spiritual powers by honoring the gods in this way, so perhaps there could be some level of this reflected in the next AC game.

What Weapons Will Be In The Next Assassin’s Creed Game?

Weapons are always a big part of Assassin’s Creed, and the Viking era makes a perfect opportunity for Ubisoft to create some truly legendary weapons.

Whilst we’re not sure what kind of unique weapons could be added to the next game, we do know there is likely to be some common Viking weapon archetypes seen throughout.

Here’s a look at some of the weapons you can expect to see if the next Assassin’s Creed game is based on the Vikings.

Battle axes

Perhaps the most iconic Viking weapon is the battle axe. Whilst it’s popular belief that Vikings used the battle axe as their weapon of choice, it was more often used as a tool, for example, for ship building.

Usually, battle axes were only used in combat during Viking raids. It’d be interesting to see a range of different battle axes in the next Assassin’s Creed.

Ubisoft could introduce smaller battle axes useful for taking down enemies silently, longer axes for battering through crowds of enemies, and maybe even throwing axes to take down enemies from a distance.

Spears

The most commonly used Viking weapon was the spear. There were typically two types of spears used – throwing spears and spears for close quarter combat. Both types of spears could fit into an Assassin’s Creed game quite well.

Shields

Many Vikings went without helmets and usually only the wealthiest of Vikings could afford to wear one. However, shields were commonplace. In fact, almost all Vikings had shields. The shields were made out of softwood. This made sure that they were cheap to produce and very expendable.

Summary

Do you think an Assassin’s Creed game set in the Viking era could be good fun? If not, where else do you think the next game should be set?

37,"MIDA Multi-Tool x5
That's all the article says. Urgh this one annoyed me. ",https://trib.al/dltFz9S,"There are a bunch of interesting weapons in Destiny 2. Auto rifles, rocket launchers, swords, and weirdo reverse-tractor beams. But which guns are best? Here’s our list of the top five.

5. MIDA Multi-Tool

The exotic scout rifle MIDA Multi-Tool is pretty easy to get. It probably has the least stringent requirements of any of Destiny 2’s exotic quests. Once you get it, you’ll have a gun that lives up to its name. It’s got so many uses! Obviously, it’s good at long range. But it staggers enemies really effectively, so it’s solid at close range, too. You really don’t need to use anything else.

4. MIDA Multi-Tool

The best thing about the MIDA Multi-Tool is that it lets you keep your radar active when you aim down your sights. That puts it way above most other guns for PvP, particularly in the more intense modes on the competitive playlist or during Trials of the Nine. Destiny 2 has increased the time it takes for your radar to come back after you aim down the sights of a normal gun, making the MIDA’s radar perk that much more valuable. It’s a no-brainer.

3. MIDA Multi-Tool

There’s plenty of new stuff in Destiny 2, so it’s comforting to use a gun that we’re all already familiar with. MIDA Multi-Tool is one of several Destiny 2 exotics that Bungie carried over from the first game. It’s been floating around the meta since waaaay back in 2014, and it just wouldn’t be Destiny if that weren’t still the case. Sequels are all about using the same guns we’ve been using for three years, right? It’s so nice to stick with what we know.

2. MIDA Multi-Tool

If you’re competing in Trials of the Nine, chances are most of your teammates are going to be using the MIDA Multi-Tool. You wouldn’t want to stick out, right? Of course not! Don’t be a weirdo! You can always equip a good auto rifle in your energy slot, if you really want to use something different from time to time. But let’s be real: if we could have our way, we’d just equip a MIDA Multi-Tool in both slots! We guess that’s what the MIDA Mini-Tool is for.

1. MIDA Multi-Tool

The MIDA Multi-Tool won our hearts years ago with its iconic “death stapler” firing sound, and we definitely have yet to get sick of it! It’s so refreshing to go into a crucible match and immediately hear that clipped thwack coming from every angle. Why use any other gun when you can use one that sounds this good? It’s a fair question.

38,"Because it there is a sign that says ""take out"" rather than ""take away"". ",https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-apologizes-to-entire-country-of-australia/1100-6452793/,"Overwatch game director Jeff Kaplan has issued an apology to the entire country of Australia over perceived ""cultural insensitivity"" regarding the new Junkertown map.

Kaplan responded on Reddit, saying he is sorry about this mistake, and pledging that a future patch will fix it. ""I'd like to offer a direct apology to the entire country of Australia. Please forgive our cultural insensitivity. We will fix this in an upcoming patch (the sign travesty will most likely go live for some period before being fixed),"" he said. I've also been told by Muselk that our coffees are too large as well. We're learning... trying, over here...""

As Kotaku points out, this isn't the only element of the new Junkertown map that is gathering some amount of controversy. The map's announcement trailer (above) has voiceover that says, ""They thought they could take our land and give it to the machines.""

Update, 3:47 p.m. EST/EDT: Looks like they’re already completely sold out.

Is there a catch? Of course there is. ThinkGeek claims to have thousands of units in stock, courtesy of its parent company GameStop. They’re available for purchase as of 3pm EST today, but while ThinkGeek won’t be selling its NES Classic Editions with as steep a markup as most eBay sellers do, you’ll still only be able to buy the sought after console as part of a bundle with other Nintendo merchandise.

The cheapest bundle, which includes box art, a Legend of Zelda puzzle, and a Piranha plant puppet, pushes the console’s price tag to $140, more than twice what the NES Classic Edition originally cost. Other bundles include collectibles like Zelda shield backpacks and stackable Tetris lamps, but the most expensive option will cost $220 and come with a Mega Man wearable helmet and Proto Man Buster blaster replica. Can you guess which bundle will sell out the fastest?

Where exactly did these unsold units of an unbelievably coveted gadget come from? ThinkGeek and GameStop won’t say. There’s an element of shameless cash grab going on here, but at least the mini consoles will make their way to the hands of fans sitting at their computers right now.

Nintendo has promised to ramp up production for its forthcoming SNES Classic Edition, which brings with it a never-before-released sequel to Star Fox. But Nintendo has a notorious history of releasing hardware with a limited supply to bolster demand (remember the eternal lineups for the Wii?) so you might still have a hard time getting the SNES Classic Edition on launch day in September.

This mission has the player go to a alien ship crash site, steal some eggs and return them to the bunker. ",https://fraghero.com/gta-v-players-trigger-secret-hidden-mission-finds-alien-crash-site-game/,"Recently, some clues emerged that something was going to happen involving the Chiliad mystery.

People had scoured the source code for the Gunrunner update, and found some clues involving Chiliad, aliens, government agents, a busted up spaceship, and more.

Now, the pieces are falling into place. It still required a little ingenuity to trigger the mission:

“Well guys, R* made the trigger for this mission quite hard to work out in the scripts,” via a discussion on the subreddit for the Chiliad Mystery.

“We knew that it all depended on a particular global variable being set to 20… so we just went ahead and forced it to be 20 using a great tool made by polivilas on our discord!! Our very own Guru WetNips managed to force the global and spawn what looks to be just another supply mission, with a twist…”

The twist is that you’re making your way over to a crash-landed UFO, and stealing alien eggs, and taking them back to your bunker while ominous music plays and aliens try to stop you.

Keep in mind, this hasn’t been officially unlocked by Rockstar yet, and is likely part of a future update, so you may want to hold off for the real thing, which will likely tie into something larger with a lot more context.

42,They did it for fun. ,https://compete.kotaku.com/15-years-later-heres-why-a-gamer-was-duct-taped-to-a-c-1796679499,"Few photos from the forum ages of online gaming live in greater infamy than one of what appears to be a human duct taped to the ceiling of a dimly lit basement, his arms reaching out to lightly graze the keys of a Dell mechanical keyboard.

Many have laid claim to this image. “I was there,” they say. “It was me, I took this photo,” others declared. We reached out to those people—most didn’t respond or couldn’t provide proof. But one thread surfaced: a group of small-town gamers who hauled computers to each other’s houses to play, among other games, Counter-Strike.

The picture in question originates from Mason, Michigan, where a close group of friends who liked to build personal computers and organize LAN parties grew up. Through Reddit and email, we were able to get in touch with a large portion of the group, as well as obtain verification and additional images.

Through all our interviews, members of the group laughed at the claims of Internet fakers and commenters.

“I don’t want to say it’s a closely guarded secret,” said Brian Schaeffer, one of the LAN goers. “But half the fun of seeing that picture pop up on the internet is all the stories where people say, ‘Oh yeah I know the people there.’ No you don’t! It was a small town, a random group of friends, and we literally just got goofy one day.”



The group told me they would hang out together in various houses and, sometimes, even a tire warehouse, lugging computer rigs to locations to play a variety of games. It was the summer of 2002, and at the time, Counter-Strike was the game to play. Others recount games like Command & Conquer, both Renegade and Red Alert 2, as well as Battlefield 1942 (for those with the 512 MB RAM to run it) and StarCraft custom games. Counter-Strike was the great equalizer. It could run on just about anything, and everyone had it.

For the Mason alumni, the night they taped Drew Purvis to the ceiling was just an average day, another LAN party with friends.

“It was still early in the day and the LAN had already become fractured,” said Nick Wellman, another LAN goer. “There were about 10 of us there, and we were already playing three, four different games. Tyler was looking around and said, ‘I think you can duct tape someone to that I-beam.’”

Advertisement

At this point, the teens gathered the necessary supplies, bought duct tape on a friend’s employee discount and had the tallest attendee, Brian, hold the subject, Drew, aloft while the rest taped him up.

Advertisement

What you see in the now-iconic photo is actually the group’s second attempt to suspend their friend from the ceiling with duct tape. After about 10 minutes, the tape digging into his sides, Drew asked to be cut down. They revised their plan, adding pillows, and strapped him back up. Once on the beam, someone else had the idea to stack some tables up so Drew could still play on his computer.

“That is the funniest part about the picture,” Nick told us. “Gaming from the beam was a complete afterthought.”

Advertisement

Drew lasted about two hours suspended above his comrades before retiring to the ground (turns out a duct tape cocoon runs hot).

Brian, who happened to bring along his digital camera from photography class that day, saved some snapshots to commemorate the moment. Drew posted the photos to a gaming forum, where it would stay duct-taped to the memories of gamers for all eternity. (We reached out to Drew for this story, and made contact, but he didn’t get back to us in time before publishing.)

“We tried to keep a list of all the places we saw the picture pop up, but it just kept started showing up in more and more places,” said Brian. “It also speaks to how when something’s on the internet, it’s always going to be up there, you can’t hide it.”

Advertisement

For the Mason alumni, it’s a little reminder of a simpler time.



“It’s so funny, because if you see the Reddit threads, every time this picture goes around every couple years it’s like a little Mason reunion,” said Jonathan Watrous, another LAN-goer.

Those mini-reunions in the comment sections of this picture help keep the group together and caught up, long after it splintered and scattered to the wind. Some still try to get together, either online through modern games like League of Legends or in-person.

“Not quite LAN parties,” said Brian of recent Mason get-togethers. “We’ve done some of those, but we’re all adults. Dragging the rigs around aren’t quite as easy as it was back then, and we’re all adults now, too. We had more time back then.”

The photo remains an indelible reminder of a time when rigs were dragged into basements and parents were kept awake by the mechanical clacking of keys to the cadence of Counter-Strike.

“I don’t see most of the people in the picture all that often, but this was before smartphones and ubiquitous social media,” said Nathan Gamber, another LAN attendee. “So it’s one of the few moments in that time that we’re reminded of every couple years.”",2017-07-10 07:27:15
43,If they can make the remaster look 'great'. ,https://fraghero.com/rockstar-is-open-to-remastering-gta-games-but-only-if-this-condition-is-met,"Take-Two Interactive spoke in detail about a lot of things during a recent investor call and it shared some details regarding Rockstar Games’ policy about doing remastered versions of old Grand Theft Auto titles such as San Andreas and GTA III. (Take-Two Interactive owns Rockstar Games.)

The company made it clear that it’s not adverse to the idea but it isn’t overly eager to do it either. It’ll only pursue such opportunities if it’s confident that it can make the remaster look ‘great‘,

Take-Two Interactive’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, explained in detail about its approach to GTA remasters when asked if games such as Vice City and GTA III might ever make it to current gen consoles.

He assured people that this was something “[Rockstar Games] will decide in due course,” but warned that it “wouldn’t do anything that’s not going to look great creatively.”



The starting point is, ‘Is this going to delight customers, is this going to look good?’. “You know that we’re a company that is not driven first and foremost by ‘Can we create revenue this way?’ We would start by saying, ‘Will this be exciting to consumers, will they be happy with it, will it reflect well on our brand, will it reflect well on our company?’ And if the answer is yes, then it may well be a compelling opportunity. But if the answer is indifferent or no then even if we have an opportunity to make a few bucks we probably would decline. I think that’s the lens through which we look, the actual decisions are made by the labels [Rockstar and 2K].

It’s clear from his statement that Rockstar Games would do justice to any Grand Theft Auto remasters, if they decide to do them. It might eventually happen if fans really want it but don’t expect Take-Two to dive into it for some quick and easy money as they value the GTA brand too dearly to pull off such gimmicks.

Take-Two also delighted fans by revealing that Rockstar Games is currently working on Red Dead Redemption 2, so there’s plenty to look forward to.",2017-07-10 07:22:56
44,"No. But it is a good idea to have access to a second OS.
",http://www.game-debate.com/news/22991/opinion-is-it-time-to-say-goodbye-to-windows-and-use-a-different-operating-system,"Computer hardware is constantly evolving, and so too do operating systems (OS). Roughly nine years ago, Windows XP Service Pack 3 was released. I wouldn't hesitate to consider it a major driving force which let people to mass adoption of PCs in a manner we hadn't seen before. Since then, the operating systems have evolved rapidly. Nowadays, we can really choose which operating system to use, and people are slowly starting to explore other options than vanilla Windows. This may be caused by dissatisfaction with the current Windows 10 situation; uncertainty about upgrading from whatever OS they are using right now, or just out of curiosity to try something different.

Most people buy devices with pre-installed Windows or use Windows because they have been using it all the time. It's not a coincidence the latest Windows 10 concerns only about 26% of desktop market share (Windows OSes together take about 90% of all desktop OSes market share), but is it really the unquestionably best OS to go for right now, or are there other ""usable"" options? Can we use different operating systems, or even live without Windows completely?

It may sound strange, but in order to answer such a question, we need to truly understand what an operating system does and why do we need it. An operating system manages computer hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs. All computer programs (excluding firmware) require an operating system to function. It acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware (although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function). To put it simply, the OS is our computer essential software servant designed to let us use our programs, play games and make use of the fancy gear we have. It should be easy to use, safe and reliable. These are its specific purposes.

So, we could get a quick conclusion right away, that whatever OS matches those demands above is a great OS to use, right? Well, it's not that simple. There's a lot more to consider. For example, graphical user interface (GUI) design defines ""ease of use"" and additional features are often seductive, but do those actually matter?

Windows, OS(X) and Linux are major players at OS market, so allow me to sum up some of the major pros and cons found in each.

Microsoft Windows

Introduced over 30 years ago, it has matured and spread to become the #1 globally recognise OS brand. Microsoft ensured most of the hardware manufacturers and software developers can rely on Windows, and that Windows can rely on them. This makes life for us, the end users, fairly easy. Microsoft offers only a few software products, Microsoft Office and Skype are practically the only ones, with Internet Explorer and Edge being part of Windows itself. Hardware products by Microsoft were practically non-existent until recently, when Microsoft launched the Surface device family (Book, Laptop, Pro, Studio). Everything else is third-party software and hardware.

Cons about Windows include system-wide vulnerability to malware, gradual congestion of the OS, registry bloating, user profile corruption, complicated (un)installing of software/hardware and updates, relatively high resource usage (CPU/RAM/disk) which may often cause perceived slower response times. Last but not least, it's fairly expensive by default - Windows 10 Pro download version costs about $325 / £220 on Microsoft's website, which isn't an insignificant amount of money considering it's the price for which GTX1060 cards are being sold in my country. There are cheaper resellers out there, but they come with their own associated risks.

Meanwhile, the recent launch of Windows 10 S indicates that the future of Windows may be as a subscription-based as-a-service closed ecosystem fully relying on UWP Store apps, which definitely isn't something people will easily adopt. This may be a serious game changer, and may mean that what we know as Windows nowadays will cease to exist entirely.

Apple Mac OS(X)

Released even before Windows, Apple's Macintosh System Software the became first ever successful graphical-based operating system. Apple ensured only very limited hardware configurations are supported, providing own Apple-branded devices (Macbook Air/Pro, iMac, Mac Pro). This helps devs to optimise software and hardware more precisely which results in better stability and more optimised resource usage. Apple provides a complete set of software, including audio and video editors (iMovie, GarageBand, or higher-end Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X) and many others.

Cons about OS(X) are actually very few, but they are major - OS(X) is available to Apple devices only (although it's possible to make custom 'Hackintosh' on non-certified hardware, which requires some fiddling and isn't supported by Apple); the second major problem is a lack of games and software for this platform - some devs release their software for multiple platforms, but the majority of games are relying on Microsoft's DirectX and other Microsoft's APIs, which obviously means no support outside of Windows. Also, it's worth mentioning OS(X) and updates are ""free"", provided only with Apple hardware - which in itself is multiple times more expensive compared to computers and laptops designed for Windows, and although they don't age quite so badly, they still become old and weak sooner or later.

Linux

At first, let's point out Linux itself is NOT an operating system, but a kernel, which needs to be bundled with additional components - those bundles are called 'distributions' or simply 'distros', of which the most popular are Ubuntu, Mint and Fedora. There are hundreds of distros to pick from, and practically all (aside from a few enterprise-targeted support-covered distros) are FREE. Yes, you read that right - entirely free, and usually also free to modify. Also worth mentioning is the fact most distros can be run from a USB stick, even without installation, so they're very easy to try out without messing with whatever OS is installed as the primary.

Cons are similar as those of OS(X), representing a minority of market share, there aren't too many software and hardware devs actively supporting and developing their products for Linux, and so the variety of available software is very limited. There aren't many vendors selling Linux computers, so common practice is to buy Windows-targeted hardware and just run Linux on it - which sometimes may be tricky. Some distros are designed with ease of use in mind, but generally, Linux installations require a moderate degree of computer knowledge and patience to make them work fine.

Conclusion

Although those systems differ a lot, I would say that a major decision point is software and hardware compatibility - the best I can recommend is to try multiple OSes and decide what is needed and what's not. The worst we can do is passively ignore the fact Windows is no longer the only choice nowadays, although it's true Windows 10 is likely to remain the platform for AAA games and so probably the most hassle-free for gamers... for now.

Is it time to say goodbye to Windows? Not yet, but why not have an alternative OS available in case a broken update makes your primary OS unbootable and you'll need to use your PC or access your files?

I tested plenty of Linux distros during the past few years, then about half year ago started using OS(X) El Capitan just out of curiosity (Hackintosh successful), leaving Windows 7 installed alongside, and I realized all software I use is multiplatform and of the little free time left to play games, I can play most of those on OS(X) directly. No longer being dependent on Windows, I don't think I even booted Windows 7 on my rig during the past six months. And although I really enjoy exploring Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB version on another rig, I am happy to have stable, reliable OS(X) on my primary workstation. I'm planning to try out some decent Linux distros, maybe Chrome OS, to replace Windows on my ancient HTPC rig in living room later as well.

What are your thoughts on current operating system options? Do you feel dependent on OS you're using now? Would you consider to test out something new or you don't have time to waste learning entirely different environment? Let us know in comments below :)",2017-07-08 11:35:39
45,They reinstated OpenIV - basically means GTA players can mod again. ,https://fraghero.com/rockstar-games-comes-rescue-angry-gta-v-players/,"About a week and a half ago, Take Two Interactive, and by extension, Rockstar Games, did the unthinkable- they banned the largest modding tool available in GTA V, OpenIV.

Understandably, the community was outraged. The Rockstar Games and GTA V forums were alight with the righteous fury of modders around the world. The Steam rating for GTA V went from a very respectable “Mostly Positive” to “Overwhelmingly Negative” over the course of just a few days. It looked like the end of one of the biggest online communities in both console and PC gaming.

Supposedly, Take Two shut down OpenIV because some of the mods that were developed specifically for the single player mode had made their way over to GTA Online, “ruining” the integrity of the game. After the shutdown, all seemed lost. It looked like the era of GTA V’s online dominance was coming to a close.

But then- a hero emerged.

Rockstar Games was able to talk down its parent company, Take Two, and get the OpenIV system reinstated in GTA V.

That’s right, OpenIV is back up.

Rockstar remained very quiet during this entire ordeal, and only gave neutral, polite responses to any questions asked. Based on their abnormal behavior, it seems as if Take Two took the reins and shut down OpenIV against the will of Rockstar’s GTA V teams. Thankfully, the hard-working crew at Rockstar was able to save OpenIV, and by extension, all of the mods made in the 3 and a half years that the game has been out and, by extension, GTA V itself.",2017-06-30 11:07:17

No release date, no details, just speculation on how the technology could be used. Not technically clickbait but it is a massively misleading title. ",https://fraghero.com/ready-play-games-directly-eyeball/,"The future is officially here, ladies and gentlemen.

The government of South Korea has just approved a patent for Samsung’s latest futuristic technological advancement– smart contact lenses. Samsung’s patent puts them on a level playing field with tech giant Google, which has 2 patents for similar hardware.

The contact lenses, which will project images directly onto the eye of the user, will be used as augmented reality hardware. The possibilities with this sort of technology are nearly endless. For example, Samsung’s (or Google’s) smart contacts could show you the outdoor temperature when you look outside. When partnered with GPS apps like Google Maps or Waze, these smart contacts could act as a real-life heads up display like you see in videogames like Forza Motorsport.

On top of these daily uses, smart contacts open up a plethora of possibilities for surgeons, first responders, and tons of other professionals. Surgeons could have “x-ray vision” that would assist them with surgery, along with live vital monitoring HUD’s. First responders could have information given to them via their contacts as situations transpire.

Oh, and don’t forget the gaming possibilities. Remember Pokemon Go? It was pretty cool on phones, but imagine how amazing it would be if you could see the Pokemon without having to look through your phone. Augmented reality games would finally gain the support and popularity they’ve been trying to get for years.

There are no dates yet for when this tech will be available to the public, but keep an *eye* open for announcements from Google and Samsung.",2017-06-27 02:00:50

",https://fraghero.com/modern-warfare-remastered-officially-confirmed-bad-news/,"The standalone version of Modern Warfare: Remastered has finally been announced for everyone who took a pass on last year’s higher-end CoD bundles but still wants to relive the glory years. The only problem is there’s a few problems with that.

For starters, it’s going to cost $40. That’s forty big ones for a remastered version of a game that was already released last year. It’s going to drop on June 27th for PC and PS4 in digital format as well as physical copies, and they’ve said other platforms are to follow.

If $40 feels steep, wait until you hear the rest of the news…

The “Variety Map Pack” which was originally included for the low, low price of free will now also cost an additional $15. So, if you want the full Modern Warfare experience, you’re basically dishing out the cost of an entire new game, which is a tough proposition, especially when you can grab PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS for a cool $29.99, or just wait for Call of Duty: World War 2 which promises to be a throwback to the classic CoD titles that still hold a special place in the hearts of many gamers.

Releasing a remastered version of one of the best Call of Duty titles was a chance for some real good will in the gaming community, especially on the heals of a huge CoD launch this year that has a lot of people looking forward to it, including people who had completely lost interest in the series of the past few iterations.

None of the code is in use yet but might be in store for a future update. ",https://fraghero.com/gta-v-players-finally-find-new-clue-solving-games-oldest-mystery/,"If you think you’ve done and seen everything there is to do and see in GTA V, chances are you’re wrong, but some people are starting to get closer to unraveling one of the game’s biggest and longest running mysteries thanks to some help from Rockstar themselves.

Not only has Rockstar been very dedicated to adding new features and updating things to keep people interested, but GTA V has built a rabid fanbase that just can’t seem to get enough, even as they navigate rocky terrain like the whole modding issue.

In GTA V’s highly anticipated Gunrunner update, players have found some code that hints at a solution to the epic Chiliad Mystery, one of the most intriguing little “side quests” in the game that ultimately leads you to the top of a mountain in the early morning to see a UFO. This mystery has spawned all sorts of crazy theories, and it seems like things may finally be getting resolved a whole four years later.

During that time, people have been searching high and low for a meaning to this mystery, even putting together big search parties of people to scour the source code, but no luck… until now.

In the source code for the Gunrunner update, there are things like aliens, an alien egg, a UFO that looks like it crash landed, and government agents who seem like they’re right out of Area 51.

It’s unclear how, if it all, you can activate all of this, or if they’re just tossing it in now with plans for a future update down the road. The smoking gun is that all of these new additions are tied to Fort Zancudo, which is no stranger to alien activity already.

Either way, there’s essentially a cult of people who have been obsessed with solving this mystery for years, and so this is huge news for the GTA V community and we’ll keep you posted with any new findings.",2017-06-26 02:00:36
50,You'll still have to put in the Infinite Warfare disk. ,https://fraghero.com/theres-bad-news-already-copy-modern-warfare-remastered/,"The bad news just keeps piling up. After an earlier announcement regarding Activision’s re-release of Modern Warfare: Remastered separate from Infinite Warfare, Activision gave us even more to be upset about.

Despite the fact that Modern Warfare: Remastered will be re-released as a standalone title, gamers who don’t buy the new version will still be tethered to their copy of Infinite Warfare. That’s right, even though the game will be released separately, gamers who have already purchased Infinite Warfare + Modern Warfare: Remastered will not be gifted a separate virtual copy of the game. Instead, they’ll still have to put the Infinite Warfare disc in their console every time they want to play Modern Warfare.

On top of that, the earlier statement from Activision regarding the standalone re-release of Modern Warfare remastered contained even more bad news for gamers. The game will cost fans $40 (a ridiculous amount for a re-release of a remaster) and it won’t even include the $15 of DLC that have been released so far. That puts the price tag for the new version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered to $55.

It’s very possible that Activision made this poorly received decision as a smart business move- there are probably quite a few gamers out there that will buy the re-release plus DLC just so they can get rid of the Infinite Warfare disc. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Remastered will be released later this month.",2017-06-25 19:25:56

53,"You're all all gamers, you've heard of these features before. Examples: connect a keyboard, connect your phone, play cross platform, connect an external hard drive...

P.s. I don't even own an Xbox and I knew all these features.",https://fraghero.com/10-things-didnt-know-xbox-one/,"Gone are the days when consoles were just simple boxes that had an On or Off Button. Nowadays they are transformed into complex machines that feature all kinds of interesting characteristics, social aspects and online connectivity meant to make the gameplay even more enjoyable than before. If you are curious about what your Xbox One packs inside, here are 10 of the most interesting things you didn’t know your favorite console could do.

Connect a Keyboard



Connecting a keyboard to your Xbox One might seem like an unintuitive thing to do since the whole point of using a console is sitting back and relaxing on the sofa with the controller in hand. But there are situations when such an option might come in handy, for example: a case where you want to write a message to a friend. Even though you might not use this feature on a daily basis, it’s still good to know that it exists on the Xbox One.

Customize your Dashboard

If you’ve gotten bored with the standard look of your home screen you’ll be glad to know that you can actually change various little things to make it more personal. By opening the “Settings” application and selecting the Personalization tab you will be able to access “My color & background” section where you’ll find various options. The background can be switched to any color you want and, in addition, you can even opt to use personal pictures, achievement art or a screenshot that you’ve taken.

Use your Phone as a Controller



For those moments when you get extra comfortable and sink into your couch after a long day of work, there’s nothing worse than realizing that the controller is way out of your reach. Luckily, it turns out that you can control your Xbox One directly through your smartphone or tablet, you just have to install a specific app for iOS or Android, log into your account and you’re good to go. This is a useful feature your Xbox one has and it would be a shame not to take advantage of it.

Customize the Controller



For ease of use or just because you like a certain configuration of the buttons, you can easily customize your controller by opening the Xbox Accessories application and playing with the adjustable settings you find there. After you’ve selected the “Configure” option, you’re free to rearrange the buttons in any manner you like and think fits your style best, because it’s very important to be able to handle your controller in the most comfortable of ways.

Broadcast Play Sessions



This option is especially useful for the aspiring streamers or YouTubers out there who want to show the entire world their prowess in playing video games. All you need to do is download the Twitch application, sign in and select the “Broadcast” option, then it will be automatically snapped to the right side of your screen and you can name it and tweak its settings. It’s good to know that such a feature is available on the Xbox One because it really makes many gamers’ life easier.

Add an External Hard Drive



In terms of usefulness, this option really tops it all. Adding an external hard drive to your Xbox One is one of the best things you can do with your console, because once you’ve ran out of the native 500GB space you’ll no longer have to delete the games or videos you’ve got in your collection. By simply connecting an external storage device to one of the USB ports available, you’ll be gaining a lot of new space to install the newest gaming titles on.

Share Games with your Friends



If you set your Xbox One as your “home” Xbox, all the other accounts that are linked to the system gain access to your games, even when you are not logged in. In this way, individual users are able to set up their own save files and earn personal achievements without affecting the game progression of the other members that use the same console. In the same way, if a friend is willing to set their “home” as your house, then both of you will have access to each other’s games for ever.

Use your Xbox One on a Win 10 PC



Once you’ve setup your Xbox One on your home network you are able to access it from any PC that runs Windows 10, so if you find yourself sitting at your desk and feeling the need to play some games that you have on your console, you can access it in a very simple way. You just have to open up the app in Windows and your Xbox One will be instantly turned on, allowing you to access your game library and choose whatever you’d like to play.

Play Cross-Platform



The dream scenario where you can play video games with your friends even if they are using a different system has finally come true. Now you can enjoy an online match with your mates thanks to the cross-platform feature that allows you to get together with PC users. Important titles like Gears of War 4, Killer Instinct, and Rocket League all let you play cooperatively or competitively against your friends, which is downright extraordinary!

Film Yourself in Green Screen videos



Upload Studio is the official video editor offered by Xbox One and even though it’s a free software, it’s surprisingly resourceful and has a lot of cool features to offer. Besides the usual ones that let you edit your gameplay clips into videos, this editor also has a powerful Kinect feature, namely it lets you record yourself as if you had a green screen setup. This is an extraordinary perk, taking into consideration the fact that most of us don’t have a designated green screen setup in our homes.",2017-06-24 11:00:42

This topic came up due to the forced split-screen in A Way Out (Even when playing online), which requires more processing power.

In an interview with Engadget, the director of A Way Out, Josef Fares, said that the PS4 isn’t as powerful as people think it is, and that it’s holding back game development.

These comments have some console gamers upset to the point of wanting to boycott this game and the previous title he directed, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. That seems a bit extreme. If you’re not interested in the game, that’s one thing. If you were interested until he compared the PS4 to a 5 year old PC, you might want to reconsider.

It’s an odd comment to make, either way. The PS4 came out in 2013 and it’s 2017 now so the console itself is nearly 5 years old. Also, the average PC gamer isn’t playing on a bleeding edge system and a mid range PC from a few years ago isn’t going to be worlds different from a current generation console in terms of what they can play.. It does stand to reason that developers aren’t going to go balls to the walls to max out high-end gaming PCs with their games when most people won’t be able to play those games, but to attribute a lack of innovation to the hardware limits on consoles seems strange as well.",2017-06-24 02:00:13
