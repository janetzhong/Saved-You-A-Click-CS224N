The range of new content has been limited and scarce, but at least now it is being rolled out. The first massive changes the fans will notice are in the new events department that will definitely bring something new, starting with ‘Pie Die’.

This event will offer you a whole new item in the form of a pie, which fans can pick up during this time. In addition to this, ‘Shamrock day’ is going to be headed to the game next, which will offer unique Shamrock day items like shoes, door plates, attire, and more.

Set five years after the events of Revenge Of The Sith, Jedi: Fallen Order follows the story of Cal Kestis.

3,Dropzone. ,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-brings-back-a-classic-/1100-6475993/,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is bringing back one of the franchise's most chaotic game modes. This week's playlist update includes Drop Zone mode, which first debuted in 2011's CoD: Modern Warfare 3.

The team-based mode challenges players to hold objectives to win, with teams earning points by staying inside the designated...drop zone. The first team to reach the goal point total wins the match. The hook with Drop Zone is that killstreaks continually fall from the sky while you're holding the zone, which leads to some particularly turbulent gameplay.

A blog post by Activision offers a number of tips, tricks, and strategies for succeeding in Drop Zone, which is played across a variety of maps such as Crash, Arklov Peak, and Granza Raid.

Drop Zone originated in Modern Warfare 3, and it was subsequently featured in other Infinity Ward-developed titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. The mode will come to Modern Warfare at some point this week across PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

It's a big week for Call of Duty, as Warzone introduces a new way to play, while Infinity Ward will offer double XP for the weekend. Modern Warfare's Season 3 is currently underway, and you can check out the new maps in a dedicated playlist right now.",CoD: Modern Warfare Has Brought Back A Mode We Loved In MW3,2020-04-15 05:56:06
4,Nepal. ,https://www.gamebyte.com/pubg-has-been-completely-banned-in-one-country/,"PUBG has been banned across the country and others look ready to follow suit.

Banned games come around every so often. Whether banned for their violence, their imagery or for their politics, it’s unfortunately a pretty common occurrence to see a country completely ban a game.

What’s not common is to see it happen to a game that’s as popular as PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, but it seems the battle royale has been banned in the country of Nepal.

Credit: PUBG Corp

Internet service providers were issued a warning from Nepal’s telecommunication authority earlier this week, and were told to block PUBG.

The instructions came from the Kathmandu district court.

Senior police official, Dhiraj Pratap Singh, told AFP [via Daily Mail]: “We sought an order from the court to ban PUBG after floods of complaints from parents, guardians and school organisations to block the game citing psychological impact on teenagers and students.”

Credit: PUBG Corp

The news comes following the death of a 16-year-old in India, who died by suicide after being told by his parents to stop playing PUBG in favour of his studies.

It’s not the first time that PUBG has been blamed for such heartbreaking news in India. Earlier this year, two men in their 20s lost their lives when absorbed in the mobile version of PUBG too close to railway tracks.

Some parts of India (more specifically, a number of cities in the state of Gujarat) have already banned PUBG after concerns of it encouraging violent behaviour and distractions from schooling.

Two dozen young people have since been arrested for violating the ban and playing the game.

In Nepal, anyone caught playing the game will now also face arrest, though the country has come under some criticism for banning the title instead of encouraging restricted play time or gaming addiction awareness.

What do you think about the ban? Will India be the next country to outlaw PUBG?

5,Conan exiles and Surge #StopClickbait,https://www.gamebyte.com/these-are-your-free-playstation-plus-games-for-april/,"Sony has revealed its line-up of monthly freebies available for PlayStation Plus subscribers, and it looks like April is going to be a fairly average month for PS players.

The first offering from Sony is Conan Exiles, which Sony describes with the following:

“Drawing inspiration from the classic barbarian tales, survival open world survival game Conan Exiles winds back the clock to the very dawn of civilization, casting you as a forgotten exile abandoned alone in the desert for crimes unknown.

“Starting out with nothing but a loincloth and your own two hands, you’ll have to explore this vast, hostile world, gathering materials, crafting tools and carving out a new life for yourself in a world filled with danger.

“Exploring a shared online space, you’ll have the chance to meet with other players, build settlements and bases together, and even raise your own armed fortresses as you advance your mission to dominate this brave new world.”

Your second freebie for April is popular RPG, The Surge, which comes from the creators of “brutal medieval action-adventure Lords of the Fallen,” and is described as “a challenging sci-fi spin on the hardcore RPG genre.”

6,"Co Director, Tai Yasue had this to say about the lack of Final Fantasy characters:

""We had a lot of original characters. It's the conclusion of the Xehanort saga and we really wanted to concentrate on the main storyline of Kingdom Hearts, such as Sora and Roxas, for the example. They're having all these stories in other games and we wanted them to conclude.""
",http://epicstream.com/news/NicoParungo/Heres-Why-No-Final-Fantasy-Characters-Appeared-in-Kingdom-Hearts-3,"Ask anyone who has played it and you would know that Kingdom Hearts 3 was another great game from Square Enix. Sure, some would argue that it didn't live up to everyone's high expectations and the combat was a bit too easy, but as a conclusion to the Xehanort saga, it was well done. As we wait for the inevitable Kingdom Hearts 4, fans are still asking one question.

Where were the Final Fantasy characters?

Yeah, despite the game's foundation being built upon a crossover between Disney and Final Fantasy, we didn't get any characters from that legendary series, outside of the Moogles. Sure, there were Dissidia NT Toys, a giant Cactuar, and statues of Cloud and Auron, but no characters from the series appeared properly.

Speaking with Game Informer, co-director Tai Yasue had this to say about the lack of Final Fantasy characters:

""We had a lot of original characters. It's the conclusion of the Xehanort saga and we really wanted to concentrate on the main storyline of Kingdom Hearts, such as Sora and Roxas, for the example. They're having all these stories in other games and we wanted them to conclude.""

Fans are hoping we get to see some Final Fantasy characters in future DLC for the game. The secret ending also teased something Square Enix-related, but we won't spoil it here, though it's a franchise Tetsuya Nomura has worked on before (and isn't Final Fantasy).

Kingdom Hearts 3 is available now on PS4 and Xbox One.

Every Disney World in Kingdom Hearts 3 16 Images

Kingdom Hearts 3 Ultimania, the official companion book for the most recent Kingdom Hearts game, includes a special interview with director Tetsuya Nomura. Translated by Twitter user @lunesacree via KH13 , Nomura reveals why properties from Marvel and Lucasfilm weren't included in the game, and it mostly boils down to contract complications - the same reason why Mickey Mouse was barely in the first Kingdom Hearts “In order to change those [properties] into a game, contracts must be made with each company separately, and there are cases where other game companies already have contracts, so although the Disney Group has indeed added those [properties], incorporating them into Kingdom Hearts isn't so simple,” said Nomura.""That’s also the reason Mickey is in only one scene in Kingdom Hearts 1,” he continued. ""At the same time, another company was releasing a game that had to do with Mickey, so though we were denied his usage, we persisted and eventually got 'as long as you only have one scene, from far away, as a silhouette, with him waving his hand or something.' Since we had to make the best of the biggest [and only] chance we had, that's why that scene appears that way.""Though we really wanted to see Star Wars and Marvel in Kingdom Hearts 3’s DLC , these comments make it seem less than likely - though certainly still possible. Nomura previously confirmed that both free and paid DLC is in the works for Kingdom Hearts 3.

9,They believe that it is outdated. #StopClickbait,https://www.gamebyte.com/sony-admits-why-it-wont-be-appearing-at-e3-this-year/,"Sony said last year it won't be presenting at E3, and now we know why.

Sony shocked gamers when it announced last year that it wouldn’t be making an appearance at E3 2019. It’s the first time in E3’s 24-year-long history that Sony has decided not to present, and considering how close we are to the launch of next-generation consoles, it was a move that raised a lot of eyebrows in the community.

It seems like we’ve now gotten some clarity on the matter though, as Sony’s SIE Worldwide Chairman Shawn Layden opened up to CNET [via Destructoid].

Layden explained: “The world has changed, but E3 hasn’t necessarily changed with it,” referencing the way that E3 was set-up at a time before the internet.

When E3 was in its infancy, people got their gaming news from magazines rather the internet, and with instantly-available news via social media, it makes sense to say E3 is a little…old school.

Instead of E3, Layden said Sony will be doing things a little differently with Destination PlayStation.

He said: “We have an event in February called Destination PlayStation, where we bring all retailers and third-party partners to come hear the story for the year.

“They’re making purchasing discussions in February. June, now, is just too late to have a Christmas holiday discussion with retailers. So retail has really dropped off. And journalists now, with the internet and the fact that 24/7 there is game news, it’s [E3] lost its impact around that…

“With our decision to do fewer games — bigger games — over longer periods of time we got to a point where June of 2019 was not a time for us to have a new thing to say.”

So…does this mean Sony’s highly-anticipated exclusive titles, Death Stranding and The Last Of Us 2 won’t be here until 2020…?

Only time will tell!

That’s what I don’t get. In one sentence he says that E3 has lost its relevancy, then he says they aren’t pulling out of E3 forever. It’s almost like he’s being a petulant child about the fact Sony won’t be there this year and having a sly dig at the E3 and others that will be. — Reidzer N7 (@ReidzerN7) February 12, 2019

10,Erdrick from the Dragon Quest series. #StopClickbait,https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/12/16/super-smash-bros-ultimate-second-dlc-character-leaked-dragon-quest/,"For quite some time now, we've gotten our fair share of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate rumors revolving around the downloadable fighters coming to the hit game. We already know that Joker from Persona 5 is confirmed thanks to a recent trailer from the Game Awards, but the rest of the roster are still shrouded in mystery. Some of these rumors have suggested that particular favorites, from Banjo Kazooie to the Rhythm Heaven choir kids to Waluigi, are coming to the game. Nothing confirmed yet, however.

Now you can add one more to the list. A new leak has suggested that the second downloadable fighter for Ultimate is coming out of left field- a character from the Dragon Quest series.

The info comes from Persona Central (originally translated from 5Channel), which suggests that Erdrick, a long-time favorite in Square Enix's role-playing series, will be joining the party. The information is translated as follows:

Erdrick

Stage is Alefgard

Erdrick (Male) and Erdrick (Female), 2 colors each of Anlucia and the Dragon Quest XI Hero

Slime appears on screen with a skill

Achieved through active collaboration on Square's side

To the benefit of overseas marketing for the DQ series

The following image was also found, possibly cementing the idea that both male and female versions of Erdrick would be included within the game:

But, on top of that, the site has also reportedly found further information about Joker, including his themed stage in Ultimate, as well as the appearance of another character.

Joker

The stage is Mementos

Jack Frost appears on screen with a skill

Game director Masahiro Sakurai did make it clear that Ultimate's DLC roster would surprise fans, and Erdrick definitely falls into this category. And the worldwide appeal of Dragon Quest would make it fairly easy to crossover a character from that universe into this fighting universe.

That aside, do take this rumor with a grain of salt. 5Channel isn't exactly the most common news source out there; and while the details and image look to be fairly accurate, we've seen rumors such as this before where proposed leaks turned out to be unsubstantiated. At least, for now.

Would you like to see a character from Dragon Quest join the Super Smash Bros. universe? Or would you prefer someone from another Square Enix franchise? Lara Croft from Tomb Raider, perhaps?

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is available now for Nintendo Switch in both physical and digital form via eShop.

The Epic Store, which you can access right here, has previously allowed people to play the likes of What Remains Of Edith Finch?, Super Meat Boy and Subnautica for the very-appealing price of free, and the next game is just as exciting.

From 24th January – 7th February you can download, play and keep the first JackBox Party Pack, just by signing up to the site. Thanks, Epic Games!

You won’t need to worry about playing with friends, as they’ll use their smartphones to access your game as you and your buddies compete for the win.

If you still want Edith Finch, today is the last day you can grab it, so you’ll have to act fast!

The Epic Store is working hard to not just provide incentives for players, but for developers too.

The new-ish digital PC store hopes to pull game devs away from Steam by giving them 88% of the revenues, keeping just 12% for itself.

Right now, Steam usually takes around 30% of revenue from devs, meaning Epic Games would be seriously undercutting them with a move like this. With such potential savings for game developers, it’s easy to see why they’d want to publish their game on an Epic store page.

The first member of the Overwatch cast to be confirmed as part of the LGBT community was of course Tracer. Now we know that a male character is actually gay. Soldier 76, also known as Jack Morrison, has been confirmed as a gay character.

The healing sniper from the game, Ana, finds a wounded Soldier 76 in the Cairo streets. She then takes him back to her hideout and speaks to him (as well as looked after him I assume). She then sees Soldier 76 going through a stack of old photos and one in particular catches her eye. The one that she spotted was an old one of Soldier 76 with a dark-haired man named Vincent. Here is what happens in the short:

“Vincent… I haven’t thought about him in years,” Ana said. “Still keeping a candle lit for him?”

Jack shook his head. “Nothing like that.”

“You’ve never looked in on him? You must have been curious. All the surveillance power in the world. I bet Gabe would have put a Blackwatch agent on him if you asked,” Ana said.

Jack glared at her.

“Okay, touchy subject.”

Jack laughed. “He got married. They’re very happy. I’m happy for him.” “Vincent deserved a happier life than the one I could give him.” Jack sighed. “We both knew that I could never put anything above my duty. Everything I fought for was to protect people like him… That’s the sacrifice I made.”

“Relationships don’t work out so well for us, do they?” Ana said, unconsciously running her thumb over where her wedding ring used to be.

15,"There's nowhere else to talk about video games.

",https://www.fraghero.com/streamer-drops-truth-people-watch-gaming-livestreams/,"First came the Let’s Plays, then came the livestreams and now, if you don’t have a favourite Twitch star or keep up with the latest eSports news then you’re sort of…out of the loop.

But why did livestreaming get so popular? For the big dogs like Ninja, the format has earned them millions and millions of dollars, and streams are the perfect place to talk to like-minded fans of games that you yourself enjoy.

One Twitch streamer believes that’s exactly why people enjoy livestreams – because they can go and talk about games.

In a recent stream, Twitch user A_Seagull said to his fans that he believes there just isn’t a place for people to talk about games anymore.

Using the example of Overwatch, he says: “People don’t talk about the game anymore. I watch a lot of stuff. There are probably less than 10 Overwatch YouTubers.

“The only place for discussions in most games is 1) Reddit 2) YouTube 3) Twitch…turns out most of the Twitch streamers are already quitting…

“Who actually talks about the game anymore?”

16,"Spider-man sounds more tired after playing for a while. They recorded two sets of audio (one resting, one exerted). The exerted audio is triggered once the player state matches certain criteria. ",https://www.gamebyte.com/fans-are-completing-spider-man-without-noticing-this-incredible-audio-detail/,"Spider-Man has been blowing fans’ minds since it released last week and its impressive attention to detail and design seemingly knows no bounds.

Kotaku writer and Spider-Man fan, Kirk Hamilton recently tweeted a clip of his playthrough of the game in which you can clearly hear a difference between ‘tired’ Spidey and ‘not-so-tired’ Spidey, with the former sounding distinctly out of breath if he’d been overexerted before speaking.

So for those of you wondering if we recorded #spidermanps4 open-world Spidey dialogue twice– yes, we did. One “resting” take, one “exerted” take. Programmers exposed a variable to Wwise allowing the game to switch between dialogue assets, depending on the player state. — Jon Paquette (@jon_paquette) September 8, 2018

The lead writer for the game, Jon Paquette, recently took to Twitter to recognise the audio as fans were left wondering how it had been done.

Paquette responded to the clip (and the many people asking about it), stating: “So for those of you wondering if we recorded #spidermanps4 open-world Spidey dialogue twice– yes, we did.

“One “resting” take, one “exerted” take. Programmers exposed a variable to Wwise allowing the game to switch between dialogue assets, depending on the player state.”

Before the audio was recognised not too many people had picked up on the very subtle yet incredibly effective detail, and fans are loving the clarification.

“This attention to detail is so incredible,” one Twitter user responded.

Kotaku reports that the Sony Interactive Entertainment’s aftercare service for the PlayStation 2 in Japan is coming to an end.

Looking back at all the good times we had, it’s hard not to feel a little emotional at the fact that it’s all over. Grand Theft Auto radio stations shaped many of our music tastes as we grew older. How many of us would have known all the words to Depeche Mode – Personal Jesus by the time we were 10 if not for the PS2?

The console launched on March 4, 2000 in Japan, and hasn’t been in production since 2012. Despite all that, it’s still the best-selling game console ever and Sony Japan respected its brilliance by continuing to service the PS2. Sadly, six years after it came off the production line it is now over.

The company has put out communication to PS2 owners, asking them to fill out online forms to have their machine serviced one last time. The cut-off date? August 31.

Any consoles that arrive at While the console has been out of production since 2012, Sony Japan continued to service to the game machine, keeping it alive. Sony is now pulling the plug. As IT Media reports, Sony Japan asked PS2 owners to fill out online forms by August 31 to have their consoles fixed one last time. PS2 that arrive at the PlayStation Clinic service center in Iwate Prefecture after September 7 will not be serviced. Customer support for the PS2 also officially ended on August 31.

People thought those colours were mixed up, and I had to reinforce to management that that’s what I wanted.”
Not really clickbait, but still an interesting read. Although the article does ramble a little. 😊",https://www.gamebyte.com/why-does-the-playstation-controller-have-triangle-circle-x-and-square/,"Since video games have existed, there’s been the need to make your avatar on the screen actually do things.

At first, this was done with simple knobs and joysticks. When video games moved from the arcades to the living room, this seemed to be the way things were going to stay.

But it wasn’t.

And although many controllers share similarities, there’s one that stands out for a very specific reason, and that’s Sony’s PlayStation controller. Why do the PlayStation controllers have a triangle, circle, X, and square?

On top of that what inspired the other design choices for the gamepad?

To find this out, we have to jump back to 1983 and look at Nintendo. After finding success in the arcade and digital toy side of gaming, with the likes of Donkey Kong and their Game and Watch handhelds, they decided to enter the home console market. They used inspiration from some of their Game and Watch digital toys for their control pad. The name of that home console? The Nintendo Entertainment System.

The simple gamepad of the NES helped set it apart from the competition. A four-way directional pad on the left, two buttons on the right, and start and select buttons in the middle. It was easy for anyone to pick up and understand. Something proven by a four-year-old me and my 60-year-old grandma on numerous occasions.

The NES controller set a new standard for the games industry, and as new systems were introduced from competitors the D-Pad quickly became a mainstay, with the face buttons varying in letters and numbers. Nintendo then introduced the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and evolved the gamepad again, in a way that still sees its influence to this very day. Two more buttons were added on the right, and two buttons were added to each shoulder at the top of the controller.

The time of the Super Nintendo was also the time of a collaboration between Nintendo and an electronics company you might have heard of – Sony.

Sony was working with them to make a CD-ROM accessory that would be compatible with the SNES, and began work on it all the way back in 1988 – two years before the SNES even existed. At the Consumer Electronics Shows in June 1991, Sony announced the collaboration to the world. At the show the very next day, Nintendo announced their partnership with Philips to make a CD-ROM accessory. A surprise to everyone… especially Sony.

This created an obvious conflict between Sony and Nintendo and spurred Sony on to make their own console, the PlayStation, which would release in 1994. The story of Sony and Nintendo’s conflict is something for another day, but an important thing to establish, as we explore why they adopted the shapes of triangle, circle, X and square.

In Super Mario World, an enemy called a Magikoopa, or Kamek (depending where you’re from), tries to attack you by firing some magic. How does that magic appear on screen? In the shape of a triangle, circle and square, with what looks suspiciously like an X as well.

Some believe this why Sony chose the shapes they did, but unfortunately that’s not the case – they have some very specific reasons for their shapes and colours.

How do we know this? From a 2010 interview with Sony engineer Teiyu Goto. Teiyu designed the PlayStation controllers and, whilst being interviewed in 2010, explained that the shapes and their colours were not just random, but something deeply thought out. He said:

Other game companies at the time assigned alphabet letters or colours to the buttons. We wanted something simple to remember, which is why we went with icons or symbols, and I came up with the triangle-circle-X-square combination immediately afterward. I gave each symbol a meaning and a colour. The triangle refers to viewpoint; I had it represent one’s head or direction and made it green. Square refers to a piece of paper; I had it represent menus or documents and made it pink. The circle and X represent ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision-making and I made them red and blue respectively. People thought those colours were mixed up, and I had to reinforce to management that that’s what I wanted.

The controller has evolved over the years to include thumbsticks, vibration, and more, but the shapes and a lot of the layout has stayed the same, making them a key part of PlayStation’s brand identity and much more than a bunch of random shapes.","Why does the PlayStation controller have Triangle, Circle, X and Square?",2018-08-17 05:20:29
20,Climbing towers to reveal areas and points of interest. Such a long article 🙄 it’s an alright read if you want to know a detailed description of the first 2 hours of Spider-Man. ,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-ps4s-first-few-hours-have-everything-we/1100-6460894/?ftag=GSS-05-10aab8d&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_content=5b6e03dd9ac5640001976654&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook,"If you love reading superhero comic books, there's a good chance that a huge part of what makes them so attractive is the way they explore the regular lives of the people behind the masks. Matt Murdoch's daily courtroom drama and neighborhood philanthropy, Jessica Drew's demanding commitments as a single mother, and the multifaceted teenage dramas of Kamala Khan and other student-aged heroes are equally as engrossing as the crime-fighting adventures of their alter-egos. And when work and life clash, that's when things really get interesting.

The more mundane side of superhero stories are rarely explored in video game adaptations, and that's something Insomniac Games is openly talking about as a major point of difference in their take on Marvel's Spider-Man. In the game's first two hours, which I experienced during a recent preview tour, a large chunk of time was spent controlling Peter Parker in his mild-mannered form, as well as Mary Jane Watson. Insomniac explained that this ratio was largely indicative of the rest of the game, with major themes of mentorship and trust as something that would be explored with and without masks.

That might sound like a far cry from what's been shown of Insomniac's Spider-Man up to this point, but these moments hit all the right notes for us. The game's version of Peter Parker falls on the dweeby side, despite being old and having almost a decade of crime-fighting expertise. He's messy, perpetually behind on his bills, and isn't currently in any kind of romantic relationship, all thanks to his second life. But he takes time to visit his Aunt May and catch up with acquaintances, as well as work on science projects as part of his day job, hoping he can do some good there, too.

I spent a large part of Spider-Man's opening hours exploring interior environments as Peter, making and listening in on small talk, looking at photos and reading documents to fill out back-story, and performing research experiments--there are Pipe Dream and pattern matching minigames that can earn you experience points to spend on Spidey abilities. Mary Jane, an investigative reporter in this universe, has her own separate narrative motivations that quickly become entwined in the rest of the plot. Her interactive segments have their own mechanics, which Insomniac told us would grow and evolve over the course of the game. For more on Mary Jane's section in these opening hours, be sure to read Kallie's in-depth account.

But as happy as I was to see a big emphasis on the Peter and MJ side of things, I still had just one thing on my mind, being this was my very first first hands-on: Whether or not Insomniac's Spider-Man was going to surpass the memories I had playing Treyarch's open-world Spider-Man 2 for consoles, generally regarded as the best Spider-Man game to date, thanks to its phenomenal web-swinging mechanics. And it most definitely does, as we've previously reported. Insomniac's Spider-Man adheres strictly to the rule that Spidey's web lines need to attach to a structure, and that creates the wonderful sense of tangibility that is both essential to selling the experience, as well as creating a satisfying need for forethought when traversing New York City.

It works like this: R2 shoots out a web line, and pressing X while mid-swing will let you jump and gain height or distance, depending on where you are in your arc. Pressing X without being attached to a web line will let you perform a quick web zip, which propels you forward, allowing you to gain directional momentum without losing height, and is great for quickly changing directions. Finally, holding L2 will trigger a slowdown, allowing you to aim a cursor and hit R2 to create a direct zipline to that particular point (provided it's in range), and is a great landing technique that allows you to expertly perch on lampposts and other locations, just like a spider can.

Web swinging feels fantastic, and minor additions, such as hitting L3 to nosedive, using Circle + Triangle in tandem with the left stick to perform aerial tricks for experience points, and the motion blur when you pick up a large amount of speed, adds a lot to making the act of getting around town a pure joy. Even Central Park can be traversed by web-swinging, thankfully, so long as you pick a route with enough trees to latch onto.

Movement on the ground also feels suitably Spider-Man-like. Aside from using L2 and R2 to web zip from point to point, holding R2 acts as an Assassin's Creed-like parkour button, allowing you to easily clear obstacles, as well as run up and across the side of buildings. But if you need a break from thinking about how to get from A to B, Spidey can also just take the subway and fast travel to a different station.

The parkour button isn't the only inspiration Insomniac's Spider-Man takes from an Ubisoft series, though. In a move that took me completely by surprise, Spider-Man incorporates the archaic mechanic of tower reveals, that is, points of interest that you have to find, travel to, and solve a puzzle at in order to reveal a map of the immediate area, as well as the locations of other points of interests like side missions, challenges, collectables, and Far Cry-style outposts. Each district of Manhattan represented in the game--Chinatown, Greenwich, Financial District, Hell's Kitchen, Midtown, Upper West Side, Central Park, Upper East Side, and Harlem--has a number of towers hidden within them, which you're required to activate before you're even able to see where you're going on your minimap.

This is strange not only because the mechanic feels incredibly outdated--Ubisoft has moved on, their open-world franchises now focus on more organic discovery mechanics--but it just doesn't make characteristic sense. Insomniac has been pitching their version of Spider-Man as an experienced one, one that's been fighting crime in New York for nearly a decade, and it's incredibly puzzling that this Spider-Man hasn't internalized an intimate geographic knowledge of the city he protects. I don't believe him when he exclaims, ""I'm flying blind here!"" while swinging through world-famous Times Square, no matter what the tower MacGuffin might be.

Any activity revealed by towers can still be found by naturally stumbling across them, and minor Spider-Man 2-style randomly-generated events, such as car crashes and armed robberies, also can pop up unannounced, which is great to see. But the emphasis on using towers to reveal them just seems like a huge misstep, a puzzling addition that feels like unnecessary filler.

But there's still plenty of good filler in there, namely, the number of things you can stuff into Spider-Man's suit. As expected, you can unlock dozens of different Spider-Man costumes by earning experience and leveling up to gain access, and spending different tokens (earned through completing side content) to purchase them for use. Each suit comes with its own unique suit ability to assist you during the game's exciting, Batman Arkham-inspired combat system, but a nice feature is that once you own a suit, you can transfer its unique ability to a different suit you own.

For example, I immediately sought to don the Spider-Man Noir costume, which comes with the ability to stop enemies from calling backup (great for stealth approaches), but swapped that out for the Battle Focus ability from the Advanced Suit seen in the game's marketing materials. Battle Focus steadily increases your Focus meter, used in combat to heal and perform the game's cinematic takedowns. Other suits and abilities I saw included the Classic Suit (webs every enemy in sight), Scarlet Spider (creates holographic decoys), and the Spider Armor MK II (protects from bullet fire).

True to Peter's science background, you can also equip a number of unique combat gadgets, switching between them using a radial menu with L1, and upgrade their effectiveness over the course of the game. Aside from the standard web shooters, they include things like impact webbing to pin enemies to surfaces, spider drones that seek out opponents and fire energy, electric webs that stun, web bombs that are proximity triggered, web trip mines, concussive blasts, and a suspension matrix that suspends enemies in the air.

The game also has a skill tree for ability progression, featuring three branches with which to upgrade Spidey's combat and web swinging techniques. The Innovator branch focuses on web-based combat techniques, such as using webs to disarm gun-toting thugs and the ability to throw a larger variety of objects and enemies, while the Defender branch improves Spider-Man's general striking, evasion, and combo abilities, letting you earn bonuses for things like perfectly-timed dodges. Finally, the Webslinger branch largely lets you perform additional traversal moves, but also gives you access to Spidey's infamous web swing kick in combat. It also unlocks the aforementioned ability to perform tricks in mid-air for small amounts of XP and large amounts of style.

There are a number of references too, of course, found in dialogue, environment, and the game's backpack collectibles. But it's a range that can be appreciated by both casual Spider-Man fans (Spidey asking ""Should we kiss?"" to a hanging enemy), and fanatics (a mention of ""Nazis made of bees""). There were some nice interactive touches I loved: using the attack buttons around citizens lets you wave and give high fives, with some interactions giving you XP, and J.J. Jameson now hosts a podcast Peter listens to, but you can unsubscribe in the audio settings menu.

Insomniac's representation of the Spider-Man experience plays as good as it looks, at least in its opening hours. The web swinging and acrobatic combat are instantly satisfying, but it's also wonderful to see that there's a lot more to it--a significant focus on interacting as Peter Parker and Mary Jane (which we're hoping will continue to evolve into something great), a depth of progression options and combat abilities, and many minor, but exciting details that positively colored my short experience. The opening hours had me eager to play more--even just to have more time swinging around the city--but it also reinvigorated my excitement about the Marvel universe in general. I just wish I could forget about those towers.","Spider-Man PS4's First Few Hours Have Everything We Want, And Something We Don't",2018-08-10 15:45:44

Speaking of Fortnite, dataminers have uncovered yet more information from the game’s latest patch.

There’s a tonne of new stuff coming to Fortnite (and really, when isn’t there?) including new game modes, cosmetic upgrades and weapons.

The latest rumours suggest we might be seeing two new sniper rifles enter play, along with new game modes which hopefully are going to keep the game as strong as ever.

The game’s developer, Epic Games, has been getting some flack recently after issues with bugs and items having to be pulled from the game came to light.

Playground Mode, shotguns, health items and more have all caused problems within the Fortnite community, so it’s a good thing Epic Games are pretty on the ball when it comes to patches and bug-fixes.

Fortnite is one of the biggest games in the world right now, with the free-to-play game’s Battle Royale mode taking the universe by storm.

Although not without its controversy, fans still can’t get enough of Fortnite. With so many regular updates from Epic Games, it’s hard to imagine this game is going anywhere anytime soon.

22,"No dates announced. Everyone knows it’s gonna be free to play eventually, everything in this article is just speculation. ",https://www.gamebyte.com/fortnites-save-the-world-will-soon-be-free-for-everyone/,"Fortnite has just turned one year old, celebrating its birthday in style with a party Battle Bus, new challenges and cosmetic goodies which will soon be leaving until (presumably) the game’s second bday.

It’s difficult to remember a time before we’d all experienced the absolute joy of the free-to-play Battle Royale mode which rocketed the game to success.

But despite Fortnite being known as a “free” game, there are still some aspects of it that will expect you to cough up the cash – Save The World, for example.

Epic Games has previous told its many, many fans that Save The World will soon be at the same cost-free status as its Battle Royale mode, but all we knew was that it was a change planned for sometime this year.

Speaking to the Express, Fortnite’s Lead Systems Designer, Eric Williamson commented: “We’re still looking at a 2018 free release for ‘Save the World.’ Epic tried to be really generous with the content in Early Access packs, and there have been events and items that exclusive to this Early Access period already!

“We appreciate everyone who’s played and supported the game so far, and our philosophy is to do everything we can to show that to our players.”

We haven’t heard too much about the potentially free content since Williamson made this statement a few months ago, but as we’re nearly through with 2018, we can imagine we’ll be getting an update on the release sooner rather than later.

There was initially a lot of speculation suggesting that the launch of Season Five of the game could introduce the first cost-free Save The World mode, but that’s yet to happen.

Maybe next season, then?

While we wait there’s still a load of content coming to the game, including new skins, weapons and even a few new modes too.

That should be plenty to tide you over until Save The World is free, right?

Microsoft confirmed back at E3 this year that work has already begun on the new consoles from Xbox, and the fact that multiple versions of the console are coming has gotten fans very excited.

Now it looks like we’ve got a bit more info on the upcoming console launch, as multiple sources are claiming the consoles are being developed under the codename ‘Scarlett.’

Of course, it’s common practise for consoles to be developed with a name that eventually has nothing to do with the final product, but this hasn’t stopped fans from speculating what the name could mean.

According to reports on other consoles, past codenames have ranged from the sensible to the downright weird, meaning ‘Scarlett’ could just be a Microsoft in-joke, a reference to a game or even just a randomly selected name.

The Wii U was developed under the name ‘Project Café,’ the PlayStation was named ‘Orbis’ and the Xbox One went by ‘Durango.’

In some other exciting news, a report from Thurrott is claiming that ‘Scarlett’ will be launching in 2020.

Writing for Thurrott, Brad Sams says: “This past week, I was tipped off that the next generation Xbox was codenamed Scarlett and in an effort to track down if this information was accurate, I was able to view content that highlighted several unannounced Microsoft products that are coming in the next two years.

“Microsoft is planning for the next Xbox console release to arrive in 2020. But what is more interesting, is that Microsoft describes ‘Scarlett’ as a family of devices; meaning we may see multiple pieces of hardware released that year.

“That date may seem relatively close considering that the Xbox One X launched last year but Microsoft is aggressively moving ahead with hardware in the console space to shake up the industry. But what we don’t know is if this is a brand new set of devices or simply a more ‘powerful’ Xbox One that is again, fully backward compatible with all the content available today.”

They continued: “Behaviour breached its contract with Bethesda and utilised its restricted access to Bethesda’s intellectual property, including Bethesda’s copyrighted code, trade secrets, and other rights, to compress its development timeline, reduce costs, and quickly bring the Westworld mobile game to market, and offer players the widely popular gameplay experience found in Fallout Shelter.”

They also reckon that Behaviour used the “same copyrighted computer code” as their own game.

The issue is a problem moving in the other direction as well; if you play Fortnite on the Switch, you will not be able to access your account through the PlayStation 4. But very few players have bumped into that issue, as the Switch version of the game was only released earlier today.

The error message that Fortnite gives you when trying to play the game on the Switch after playing on the PlayStation 4 is rather icy, and sounds like Epic Games knew of the issue and wanted to make damn sure you understood that it wasn’t their fault.

Sony hasn’t gotten back to us. Epic Games gave us a “no comment,” even as the number of angry tweets about this situation pile up. Nintendo also declined to comment on the situation.

Epic Games itself provides a detailed FAQ about cross-platform play which indicates that the Switch and PlayStation 4 versions of the game won’t be able to interact, but nowhere does it say that playing the PlayStation 4 version at all means you can’t use your main account or any of the items you’ve purchased on the Nintendo Switch.

How the hell is this going on for so long without anyone explaining what’s going on? And if any of these companies knew this was going to happen, why were we never warned not to play the game on the PlayStation 4?

This whole thing is bad news for Sony. Despite no official statements about whose decision this was or who is responsible, a quick look around social media indicates that everyone blames Sony for the issue.

It’s not an unreasonable assumption, even if it’s based on speculation. We know Sony has kept companies from offering cross-platform play in the past. We know that Epic Games has made Xbox to PlayStation 4 cross-platform play available on Fortnite in the past. We know that Xbox’s social media team is having a good time dunking on Sony today. Whatever is actually going on, this makes Sony look like a spoiled child.

If Sony isn’t to blame for this situation, an explanation of that fact is hours overdue.

Finding out your account is locked out from playing on the Nintendo Switch because you made the mistake of playing on the PlayStation 4 sucks, and no one warned us it would happen.

Sega released the ‘demo’ for one of their latest games Yakuza 6 onto PSN stores worldwide but what they didn’t realise was that they had released the content for the whole game. Some people noticed the size of the download was huge for a demo for the game.

In the demo there was a capped off point but some players managed to work out how they could bypass it and have access to the whole game.

The SEGA account tweeted this after the problem had arisen.

28,Simply a list of obvious things.,https://www.gamebyte.com/worst-mistakes-everybody-makes-fortnite/,"Fortnite is a great game but some of us can't seem to quite get that elusive victory royale. We are here to help.

We all love to play Fortnite at the moment. The whole world can’t seem to get enough of the 100 man battle royale game. Many of those people, including you reading this, suck. But don’t worry we got you covered. Here is our list of how to improve at Fortnite BR.

Heading Straight to a Big City

The majority of Fortnite players tend to be extra greedy and jump out of the Battle Bus right above the biggest city they see on the map, but this is not such a great idea. In the first few minutes of the game you’ll probably not have enough weapons and ammunition to be able to get into fights with other people and this is why you should avoid heading straight towards a big city; and, instead settle for a more innocuous settlement that is partially deserted so that you can loot the houses at your own pace and without the fear that you’ll get shot at by enemies.

Overlooking Building Materials

We know that Fortnite is the kind of game where you’ll want go in all guns blazing but the end game is usually won by working with a plan in mind, and building structures is the best thing you could do to achieve success. Having a variety of good weapons and plenty of ammo are two very important objectives but building materials will prove to be vital during the stormy nights so you’ll always have to be careful and gather enough household resources if you want to be able to survive in the long run. All in all, in Fortnite, guns are great, but bricks and wood planks will also prove to be very handy in a pinch.



Using the Wrong Weapon

The assault rifle is the best all-around weapon in the entire game and even though you might get so attached to it that you practically glue it to your palms, it would be wise to take the other options that are in your inventory into consideration. For example, a pumpkin launcher, a shotgun and even some explosives will prove to be perfectly viable alternatives that will help you in situations when an assault rifle would probably fail. And here is yet another piece of advice: rapidly switching between weaponry is your definite lifesaving move in Fortnite, so by all means, practice until you become the best gunslinger in the game.

Forgetting to Build

The main advantage you have in Fortnite is that you can build your very own shield wherever you are, so when you get yourself surrounded by enemies and there is no way out, think outside of the box and put together a small shelter that you can get cover in. Forgetting to build useful structures is definitely one of the worst mistakes you could commit while playing this game and if you’re going to watch let’s plays done by well-prepared players you’ll see that they tend to put together buildings more often than they shoot.



Underestimating Sound

When you’re playing fast paced survival games, listening to environmental sounds is vital because in this way you can predict the direction an enemy is approaching from, or you can hear if there is a battle close to you. Thankfully, Fortnite has a very unique sound selection that is not only very easily recognizable but also loud and clear enough to give you all the necessary hints when it comes to engaging into combat with more than just the sense of sight. In conclusion, underestimating sound can turn out to be one of those apparently innocent mistakes that are in fact crucial to the outcome of your gameplay.

Not Sorting Your Inventory

There’s nothing worse than a messy inventory where weapons mix up with building materials, aiding kits and miscellaneous loot and we are not saying this because we are some kind of superior beings who are always tidy, however, in a game like Fortnite, when you need to switch between guns in a matter of seconds, you’ll surely want to not be pointing a piece of wood towards the enemy by mistake. All in all, keeping a clear head as well as a clean inventory are two of the easiest ways of avoiding small yet fatal mistakes that could get you killed.

29,Dead Space.,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-next-free-pc-game-now-available-and-its-a-good/1100-6456765/,"Dead Space, the acclaimed 2008 sci-fi horror game from the now-defunct developer Visceral Games, is now completely free on PC. It is the newest ""On the House"" game from publisher Electronic Arts, and you can grab it right here from Origin.

As with the previous On the House titles, once you download Dead Space it is yours to keep forever. The only catch is that EA doesn't say when On the House titles cycle out, so if you're interested, you may want to grab the game right now instead of putting it off until later.

Dead Space was already in the Origin Access free game library on PC, so if you subscribe to that service you have been able to play the game at no cost for a while now. The game was also released on Xbox 360, and it is playable on Xbox One through backwards compatibility. The Xbox 360 edition is in the Xbox One EA Access library.

Dead Space was in fact the very first EA On the House freebie, kicking off the freebie campaign back in 2014. It appears to be the first title to have two runs in the On the House hopper.

In Dead Space, you play as a space engineer named Isaac Clarke who must fight all manner of ghastly creatures on a spaceship. Sequels Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3 were released in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey, who now lead Call of Duty studio Sledgehammer Games, worked on Dead Space before starting their own studio.

Dead Space 3 failed to meet EA's sales expectations. However, despite that, the publisher said in 2013 that the brand remains one that is ""close to Electronic Arts' heart."" However, with creator Visceral Games now shuttered, it remains to be seen if the franchise has a future at EA.","Free PC Game From EA Available, And It's A Good One",2018-02-15 14:30:23
30,"The Viking era. ""Assassin's Creed: Ragnarok"".",https://www.gamebyte.com/next-assassins-creed-could-be-set/,"The Assassins Creed franchise has been all around the world in many different settings. Here is where the franchise could be going next.

New concept art has been released for what might be the next Assassin’s Creed game and it has us wondering where the next Assassin’s Creed could be set.

Where will the next Assassin’s Creed be set?

Let’s look into where the next game could be set within the Assassin’s Creed franchise and see what kind of gameplay content could come from it.

It’s important to remember that the information in this post is so based on speculation and rumors so far, but with newly released concept art, it’s possible that these rumors could come true. If they are true, we could have a very exciting new Assassin’s Creed game on our hands.

Will The Next Assassin’s Creed Be Based On Vikings?

If recent concept art is anything to go by, the next game will be based on the Viking era. The next game has been rumoured to be called Assassin’s Creed: Ragnarok.

With the Viking era potential in mind, there are a lot of questions we have to ask about what gameplay mechanics the new game will have. I’ve tried to find answers to some of these questions below.

The Next Assassin’s Creed Game Will Have Naval Combat

If Ubisoft opt for the Viking setting, adding naval combat would make perfect sense. Naval warfare was always a big part of the Viking lifestyle. Thankfully, we already know that naval combat can work really well in Assassin’s Creed games.

Black Flag is the perfect example of how naval combat and sea exploration can expand on the Assassin’s Creed universe in an exciting new way. I’d absolutely love to see a return to this kind of gameplay in the next Assassin’s Creed game.

If rumours are to be true, you may once again be given the option to commandeer your own ship. Some speculation suggests that you’ll be pitted up against a rival Viking clan and will regularly be put into naval combat situations whilst exploring the deep sea.

Blending Stealth With The Typical Viking Archetype

Whilst Assassin’s Creed games can often be so different from one another, one element always stays the same throughout the franchise.

As the name would suggest Assassin’s Creed always implements some kind of stealth into the gameplay. Typically, you wouldn’t consider a Viking to be particularly stealthy – they’re often looked at as tough, heavy-hitting combatants.

It will be interesting to see how Ubisoft blend the stealth elements of past Assassin’s Creed titles into a Viking style game.

Interestingly, there is some history that suggests Vikings weren’t as brutish as one may think. In the past, Vikings would use a mixture of deceit and stealth to take down their enemies.

One thing that is important to note is that Vikings would often do anything they could to carry out attacks. Vikings were known to be ruthless, but that didn’t mean they were always running in head first to combat. Instead, Vikings were actually smart thinkers that’d use any means possible to get an edge in combat.

Perhaps if the new Assassin’s Creed game was set in the Viking era, we could see a variety of options for players to choose how they want to take out enemies. A variety of improvised weapons alongside different options for stealthy or non-stealthy approaches could be considered.

For when things get really tough, Ubisoft could add some kind of Bezerk combat mode that would make dealing with waves of enemies less challenging.

What Will Be The Backstory For The Next Assassin’s Creed Game?

In past Assassin’s Creed games, there have often been references to religion or the gods in some way or another. Usually, religion has played a big part of the story for past games in the franchise.

During the Viking era, many believed in the Norse gods. Could we some kind of reference to the Norse gods in the backstory for the next Assassin’s Creed game? I think it’s totally possible.

In the past, Vikings would also pillage religious sites and attack places that were particularly vulnerable.

The cause of their ruthlessness was often attributed to honoring a particular Norse god. Many believed that Vikings would attain spiritual powers by honoring the gods in this way, so perhaps there could be some level of this reflected in the next AC game.

What Weapons Will Be In The Next Assassin’s Creed Game?

Weapons are always a big part of Assassin’s Creed, and the Viking era makes a perfect opportunity for Ubisoft to create some truly legendary weapons.

Whilst we’re not sure what kind of unique weapons could be added to the next game, we do know there is likely to be some common Viking weapon archetypes seen throughout.

Here’s a look at some of the weapons you can expect to see if the next Assassin’s Creed game is based on the Vikings.

Battle axes

Perhaps the most iconic Viking weapon is the battle axe. Whilst it’s popular belief that Vikings used the battle axe as their weapon of choice, it was more often used as a tool, for example, for ship building.

Usually, battle axes were only used in combat during Viking raids. It’d be interesting to see a range of different battle axes in the next Assassin’s Creed.

Ubisoft could introduce smaller battle axes useful for taking down enemies silently, longer axes for battering through crowds of enemies, and maybe even throwing axes to take down enemies from a distance.

Spears

The most commonly used Viking weapon was the spear. There were typically two types of spears used – throwing spears and spears for close quarter combat. Both types of spears could fit into an Assassin’s Creed game quite well.

Shields

Many Vikings went without helmets and usually only the wealthiest of Vikings could afford to wear one. However, shields were commonplace. In fact, almost all Vikings had shields. The shields were made out of softwood. This made sure that they were cheap to produce and very expendable.

Summary

Do you think an Assassin’s Creed game set in the Viking era could be good fun? If not, where else do you think the next game should be set?

That's all the article says. Urgh this one annoyed me. ",https://trib.al/dltFz9S,"There are a bunch of interesting weapons in Destiny 2. Auto rifles, rocket launchers, swords, and weirdo reverse-tractor beams. But which guns are best? Here’s our list of the top five.

5. MIDA Multi-Tool

The exotic scout rifle MIDA Multi-Tool is pretty easy to get. It probably has the least stringent requirements of any of Destiny 2’s exotic quests. Once you get it, you’ll have a gun that lives up to its name. It’s got so many uses! Obviously, it’s good at long range. But it staggers enemies really effectively, so it’s solid at close range, too. You really don’t need to use anything else.

4. MIDA Multi-Tool

The best thing about the MIDA Multi-Tool is that it lets you keep your radar active when you aim down your sights. That puts it way above most other guns for PvP, particularly in the more intense modes on the competitive playlist or during Trials of the Nine. Destiny 2 has increased the time it takes for your radar to come back after you aim down the sights of a normal gun, making the MIDA’s radar perk that much more valuable. It’s a no-brainer.

3. MIDA Multi-Tool

There’s plenty of new stuff in Destiny 2, so it’s comforting to use a gun that we’re all already familiar with. MIDA Multi-Tool is one of several Destiny 2 exotics that Bungie carried over from the first game. It’s been floating around the meta since waaaay back in 2014, and it just wouldn’t be Destiny if that weren’t still the case. Sequels are all about using the same guns we’ve been using for three years, right? It’s so nice to stick with what we know.

2. MIDA Multi-Tool

If you’re competing in Trials of the Nine, chances are most of your teammates are going to be using the MIDA Multi-Tool. You wouldn’t want to stick out, right? Of course not! Don’t be a weirdo! You can always equip a good auto rifle in your energy slot, if you really want to use something different from time to time. But let’s be real: if we could have our way, we’d just equip a MIDA Multi-Tool in both slots! We guess that’s what the MIDA Mini-Tool is for.

1. MIDA Multi-Tool

The MIDA Multi-Tool won our hearts years ago with its iconic “death stapler” firing sound, and we definitely have yet to get sick of it! It’s so refreshing to go into a crucible match and immediately hear that clipped thwack coming from every angle. Why use any other gun when you can use one that sounds this good?

Update, 3:47 p.m. EST/EDT: Looks like they’re already completely sold out.

Is there a catch? Of course there is. ThinkGeek claims to have thousands of units in stock, courtesy of its parent company GameStop. They’re available for purchase as of 3pm EST today, but while ThinkGeek won’t be selling its NES Classic Editions with as steep a markup as most eBay sellers do, you’ll still only be able to buy the sought after console as part of a bundle with other Nintendo merchandise.

The cheapest bundle, which includes box art, a Legend of Zelda puzzle, and a Piranha plant puppet, pushes the console’s price tag to $140, more than twice what the NES Classic Edition originally cost. Other bundles include collectibles like Zelda shield backpacks and stackable Tetris lamps, but the most expensive option will cost $220 and come with a Mega Man wearable helmet and Proto Man Buster blaster replica. Can you guess which bundle will sell out the fastest?

This mission has the player go to a alien ship crash site, steal some eggs and return them to the bunker. ",https://fraghero.com/gta-v-players-trigger-secret-hidden-mission-finds-alien-crash-site-game/,"Recently, some clues emerged that something was going to happen involving the Chiliad mystery.

People had scoured the source code for the Gunrunner update, and found some clues involving Chiliad, aliens, government agents, a busted up spaceship, and more.

Now, the pieces are falling into place. It still required a little ingenuity to trigger the mission:

“Well guys, R* made the trigger for this mission quite hard to work out in the scripts,” via a discussion on the subreddit for the Chiliad Mystery.

“We knew that it all depended on a particular global variable being set to 20… so we just went ahead and forced it to be 20 using a great tool made by polivilas on our discord!! Our very own Guru WetNips managed to force the global and spawn what looks to be just another supply mission, with a twist…”

The twist is that you’re making your way over to a crash-landed UFO, and stealing alien eggs, and taking them back to your bunker while ominous music plays and aliens try to stop you.

Keep in mind, this hasn’t been officially unlocked by Rockstar yet, and is likely part of a future update, so you may want to hold off for the real thing, which will likely tie into something larger with a lot more context. Either way, here’s the video of the mission, check it out:","GTA V players trigger secret hidden mission, find alien crash site in the game",2017-07-11 15:15:12
43,They did it for fun. ,https://compete.kotaku.com/15-years-later-heres-why-a-gamer-was-duct-taped-to-a-c-1796679499,"Few photos from the forum ages of online gaming live in greater infamy than one of what appears to be a human duct taped to the ceiling of a dimly lit basement, his arms reaching out to lightly graze the keys of a Dell mechanical keyboard.

Many have laid claim to this image. “I was there,” they say. “It was me, I took this photo,” others declared. We reached out to those people—most didn’t respond or couldn’t provide proof. But one thread surfaced: a group of small-town gamers who hauled computers to each other’s houses to play, among other games, Counter-Strike.

The picture in question originates from Mason, Michigan, where a close group of friends who liked to build personal computers and organize LAN parties grew up. Through Reddit and email, we were able to get in touch with a large portion of the group, as well as obtain verification and additional images.

Through all our interviews, members of the group laughed at the claims of Internet fakers and commenters.

“I don’t want to say it’s a closely guarded secret,” said Brian Schaeffer, one of the LAN goers. “But half the fun of seeing that picture pop up on the internet is all the stories where people say, ‘Oh yeah I know the people there.’ No you don’t! It was a small town, a random group of friends, and we literally just got goofy one day.”



The group told me they would hang out together in various houses and, sometimes, even a tire warehouse, lugging computer rigs to locations to play a variety of games. It was the summer of 2002, and at the time, Counter-Strike was the game to play. Others recount games like Command & Conquer, both Renegade and Red Alert 2, as well as Battlefield 1942 (for those with the 512 MB RAM to run it) and StarCraft custom games. Counter-Strike was the great equalizer. It could run on just about anything, and everyone had it.

For the Mason alumni, the night they taped Drew Purvis to the ceiling was just an average day, another LAN party with friends.

“It was still early in the day and the LAN had already become fractured,” said Nick Wellman, another LAN goer. “There were about 10 of us there, and we were already playing three, four different games. Tyler was looking around and said, ‘I think you can duct tape someone to that I-beam.’”

At this point, the teens gathered the necessary supplies, bought duct tape on a friend’s employee discount and had the tallest attendee, Brian, hold the subject, Drew, aloft while the rest taped him up.

What you see in the now-iconic photo is actually the group’s second attempt to suspend their friend from the ceiling with duct tape. After about 10 minutes, the tape digging into his sides, Drew asked to be cut down. They revised their plan, adding pillows, and strapped him back up. Once on the beam, someone else had the idea to stack some tables up so Drew could still play on his computer.

“That is the funniest part about the picture,” Nick told us. “Gaming from the beam was a complete afterthought.”

Drew lasted about two hours suspended above his comrades before retiring to the ground (turns out a duct tape cocoon runs hot).

Brian, who happened to bring along his digital camera from photography class that day, saved some snapshots to commemorate the moment. Drew posted the photos to a gaming forum, where it would stay duct-taped to the memories of gamers for all eternity. (We reached out to Drew for this story, and made contact, but he didn’t get back to us in time before publishing.)

“We tried to keep a list of all the places we saw the picture pop up, but it just kept started showing up in more and more places,” said Brian. “It also speaks to how when something’s on the internet, it’s always going to be up there, you can’t hide it.”

For the Mason alumni, it’s a little reminder of a simpler time.



“It’s so funny, because if you see the Reddit threads, every time this picture goes around every couple years it’s like a little Mason reunion,” said Jonathan Watrous, another LAN-goer.

Those mini-reunions in the comment sections of this picture help keep the group together and caught up, long after it splintered and scattered to the wind. Some still try to get together, either online through modern games like League of Legends or in-person.

“Not quite LAN parties,” said Brian of recent Mason get-togethers. “We’ve done some of those, but we’re all adults. Dragging the rigs around aren’t quite as easy as it was back then, and we’re all adults now, too. We had more time back then.”

The photo remains an indelible reminder of a time when rigs were dragged into basements and parents were kept awake by the mechanical clacking of keys to the cadence of Counter-Strike.

“I don’t see most of the people in the picture all that often, but this was before smartphones and ubiquitous social media,” said Nathan Gamber, another LAN attendee. “So it’s one of the few moments in that time that we’re reminded of every couple years.”","15 Years Later, Here's Why A Gamer Was Duct-Taped To A Ceiling",2017-07-10 07:27:15
44,If they can make the remaster look 'great'. ,https://fraghero.com/rockstar-is-open-to-remastering-gta-games-but-only-if-this-condition-is-met,"Take-Two Interactive spoke in detail about a lot of things during a recent investor call and it shared some details regarding Rockstar Games’ policy about doing remastered versions of old Grand Theft Auto titles such as San Andreas and GTA III. (Take-Two Interactive owns Rockstar Games.)

The company made it clear that it’s not adverse to the idea but it isn’t overly eager to do it either. It’ll only pursue such opportunities if it’s confident that it can make the remaster look ‘great‘,

Take-Two Interactive’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, explained in detail about its approach to GTA remasters when asked if games such as Vice City and GTA III might ever make it to current gen consoles.

He assured people that this was something “[Rockstar Games] will decide in due course,” but warned that it “wouldn’t do anything that’s not going to look great creatively.”



The starting point is, ‘Is this going to delight customers, is this going to look good?’. “You know that we’re a company that is not driven first and foremost by ‘Can we create revenue this way?’ We would start by saying, ‘Will this be exciting to consumers, will they be happy with it, will it reflect well on our brand, will it reflect well on our company?’ And if the answer is yes, then it may well be a compelling opportunity. But if the answer is indifferent or no then even if we have an opportunity to make a few bucks we probably would decline. I think that’s the lens through which we look, the actual decisions are made by the labels [Rockstar and 2K].

It’s clear from his statement that Rockstar Games would do justice to any Grand Theft Auto remasters, if they decide to do them. It might eventually happen if fans really want it but don’t expect Take-Two to dive into it for some quick and easy money as they value the GTA brand too dearly to pull off such gimmicks.

Take-Two also delighted fans by revealing that Rockstar Games is currently working on Red Dead Redemption 2, so there’s plenty to look forward to.",Rockstar is open to remastering GTA games but only if this condition is met,2017-07-10 07:22:56
45,"No. But it is a good idea to have access to a second OS.
",http://www.game-debate.com/news/22991/opinion-is-it-time-to-say-goodbye-to-windows-and-use-a-different-operating-system,"Computer hardware is constantly evolving, and so too do operating systems (OS). Roughly nine years ago, Windows XP Service Pack 3 was released. I wouldn't hesitate to consider it a major driving force which let people to mass adoption of PCs in a manner we hadn't seen before. Since then, the operating systems have evolved rapidly. Nowadays, we can really choose which operating system to use, and people are slowly starting to explore other options than vanilla Windows. This may be caused by dissatisfaction with the current Windows 10 situation; uncertainty about upgrading from whatever OS they are using right now, or just out of curiosity to try something different.

Most people buy devices with pre-installed Windows or use Windows because they have been using it all the time. It's not a coincidence the latest Windows 10 concerns only about 26% of desktop market share (Windows OSes together take about 90% of all desktop OSes market share), but is it really the unquestionably best OS to go for right now, or are there other ""usable"" options? Can we use different operating systems, or even live without Windows completely?

It may sound strange, but in order to answer such a question, we need to truly understand what an operating system does and why do we need it. An operating system manages computer hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs. All computer programs (excluding firmware) require an operating system to function. It acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware (although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function). To put it simply, the OS is our computer essential software servant designed to let us use our programs, play games and make use of the fancy gear we have. It should be easy to use, safe and reliable. These are its specific purposes.

So, we could get a quick conclusion right away, that whatever OS matches those demands above is a great OS to use, right? Well, it's not that simple. There's a lot more to consider. For example, graphical user interface (GUI) design defines ""ease of use"" and additional features are often seductive, but do those actually matter?

Windows, OS(X) and Linux are major players at OS market, so allow me to sum up some of the major pros and cons found in each.

Microsoft Windows

Introduced over 30 years ago, it has matured and spread to become the #1 globally recognise OS brand. Microsoft ensured most of the hardware manufacturers and software developers can rely on Windows, and that Windows can rely on them. This makes life for us, the end users, fairly easy. Microsoft offers only a few software products, Microsoft Office and Skype are practically the only ones, with Internet Explorer and Edge being part of Windows itself. Hardware products by Microsoft were practically non-existent until recently, when Microsoft launched the Surface device family (Book, Laptop, Pro, Studio). Everything else is third-party software and hardware.

Cons about Windows include system-wide vulnerability to malware, gradual congestion of the OS, registry bloating, user profile corruption, complicated (un)installing of software/hardware and updates, relatively high resource usage (CPU/RAM/disk) which may often cause perceived slower response times. Last but not least, it's fairly expensive by default - Windows 10 Pro download version costs about $325 / £220 on Microsoft's website, which isn't an insignificant amount of money considering it's the price for which GTX1060 cards are being sold in my country. There are cheaper resellers out there, but they come with their own associated risks.

Meanwhile, the recent launch of Windows 10 S indicates that the future of Windows may be as a subscription-based as-a-service closed ecosystem fully relying on UWP Store apps, which definitely isn't something people will easily adopt. This may be a serious game changer, and may mean that what we know as Windows nowadays will cease to exist entirely.

Apple Mac OS(X)

Released even before Windows, Apple's Macintosh System Software the became first ever successful graphical-based operating system. Apple ensured only very limited hardware configurations are supported, providing own Apple-branded devices (Macbook Air/Pro, iMac, Mac Pro). This helps devs to optimise software and hardware more precisely which results in better stability and more optimised resource usage. Apple provides a complete set of software, including audio and video editors (iMovie, GarageBand, or higher-end Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X) and many others.

Cons about OS(X) are actually very few, but they are major - OS(X) is available to Apple devices only (although it's possible to make custom 'Hackintosh' on non-certified hardware, which requires some fiddling and isn't supported by Apple); the second major problem is a lack of games and software for this platform - some devs release their software for multiple platforms, but the majority of games are relying on Microsoft's DirectX and other Microsoft's APIs, which obviously means no support outside of Windows. Also, it's worth mentioning OS(X) and updates are ""free"", provided only with Apple hardware - which in itself is multiple times more expensive compared to computers and laptops designed for Windows, and although they don't age quite so badly, they still become old and weak sooner or later.

Linux

At first, let's point out Linux itself is NOT an operating system, but a kernel, which needs to be bundled with additional components - those bundles are called 'distributions' or simply 'distros', of which the most popular are Ubuntu, Mint and Fedora. There are hundreds of distros to pick from, and practically all (aside from a few enterprise-targeted support-covered distros) are FREE. Yes, you read that right - entirely free, and usually also free to modify. Also worth mentioning is the fact most distros can be run from a USB stick, even without installation, so they're very easy to try out without messing with whatever OS is installed as the primary.

Cons are similar as those of OS(X), representing a minority of market share, there aren't too many software and hardware devs actively supporting and developing their products for Linux, and so the variety of available software is very limited. There aren't many vendors selling Linux computers, so common practice is to buy Windows-targeted hardware and just run Linux on it - which sometimes may be tricky. Some distros are designed with ease of use in mind, but generally, Linux installations require a moderate degree of computer knowledge and patience to make them work fine.

Conclusion

Although those systems differ a lot, I would say that a major decision point is software and hardware compatibility - the best I can recommend is to try multiple OSes and decide what is needed and what's not. The worst we can do is passively ignore the fact Windows is no longer the only choice nowadays, although it's true Windows 10 is likely to remain the platform for AAA games and so probably the most hassle-free for gamers... for now.

Is it time to say goodbye to Windows? Not yet, but why not have an alternative OS available in case a broken update makes your primary OS unbootable and you'll need to use your PC or access your files?

I tested plenty of Linux distros during the past few years, then about half year ago started using OS(X) El Capitan just out of curiosity (Hackintosh successful), leaving Windows 7 installed alongside, and I realized all software I use is multiplatform and of the little free time left to play games, I can play most of those on OS(X) directly. No longer being dependent on Windows, I don't think I even booted Windows 7 on my rig during the past six months. And although I really enjoy exploring Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB version on another rig, I am happy to have stable, reliable OS(X) on my primary workstation. I'm planning to try out some decent Linux distros, maybe Chrome OS, to replace Windows on my ancient HTPC rig in living room later as well.

What are your thoughts on current operating system options? Do you feel dependent on OS you're using now? Would you consider to test out something new or you don't have time to waste learning entirely different environment?

46,They reinstated OpenIV - basically means GTA players can mod again. ,https://fraghero.com/rockstar-games-comes-rescue-angry-gta-v-players/,"About a week and a half ago, Take Two Interactive, and by extension, Rockstar Games, did the unthinkable- they banned the largest modding tool available in GTA V, OpenIV.

Understandably, the community was outraged. The Rockstar Games and GTA V forums were alight with the righteous fury of modders around the world. The Steam rating for GTA V went from a very respectable “Mostly Positive” to “Overwhelmingly Negative” over the course of just a few days. It looked like the end of one of the biggest online communities in both console and PC gaming.

Supposedly, Take Two shut down OpenIV because some of the mods that were developed specifically for the single player mode had made their way over to GTA Online, “ruining” the integrity of the game. After the shutdown, all seemed lost. It looked like the era of GTA V’s online dominance was coming to a close.

But then- a hero emerged.

Rockstar Games was able to talk down its parent company, Take Two, and get the OpenIV system reinstated in GTA V.

That’s right, OpenIV is back up.

Rockstar remained very quiet during this entire ordeal, and only gave neutral, polite responses to any questions asked. Based on their abnormal behavior, it seems as if Take Two took the reins and shut down OpenIV against the will of Rockstar’s GTA V teams. Thankfully, the hard-working crew at Rockstar was able to save OpenIV, and by extension, all of the mods made in the 3 and a half years that the game has been out and, by extension, GTA V itself.",Rockstar Games Comes to the Rescue of Angry GTA V Players,2017-06-30 11:07:17

",https://fraghero.com/ready-play-games-directly-eyeball/,"The future is officially here, ladies and gentlemen.

The government of South Korea has just approved a patent for Samsung’s latest futuristic technological advancement– smart contact lenses. Samsung’s patent puts them on a level playing field with tech giant Google, which has 2 patents for similar hardware.

The contact lenses, which will project images directly onto the eye of the user, will be used as augmented reality hardware. The possibilities with this sort of technology are nearly endless. For example, Samsung’s (or Google’s) smart contacts could show you the outdoor temperature when you look outside. When partnered with GPS apps like Google Maps or Waze, these smart contacts could act as a real-life heads up display like you see in videogames like Forza Motorsport.

On top of these daily uses, smart contacts open up a plethora of possibilities for surgeons, first responders, and tons of other professionals. Surgeons could have “x-ray vision” that would assist them with surgery, along with live vital monitoring HUD’s. First responders could have information given to them via their contacts as situations transpire.

Oh, and don’t forget the gaming possibilities. Remember Pokemon Go? It was pretty cool on phones, but imagine how amazing it would be if you could see the Pokemon without having to look through your phone.

If $40 feels steep, wait until you hear the rest of the news…

In GTA V’s highly anticipated Gunrunner update, players have found some code that hints at a solution to the epic Chiliad Mystery, one of the most intriguing little “side quests” in the game that ultimately leads you to the top of a mountain in the early morning to see a UFO. This mystery has spawned all sorts of crazy theories, and it seems like things may finally be getting resolved a whole four years later.

After an earlier announcement regarding Activision’s re-release of Modern Warfare: Remastered separate from Infinite Warfare, Activision gave us even more to be upset about.

Despite the fact that Modern Warfare: Remastered will be re-released as a standalone title, gamers who don’t buy the new version will still be tethered to their copy of Infinite Warfare. That’s right, even though the game will be released separately, gamers who have already purchased Infinite Warfare + Modern Warfare: Remastered will not be gifted a separate virtual copy of the game. Instead, they’ll still have to put the Infinite Warfare disc in their console every time they want to play Modern Warfare.

On top of that, the earlier statement from Activision regarding the standalone re-release of Modern Warfare remastered contained even more bad news for gamers. The game will cost fans $40 (a ridiculous amount for a re-release of a remaster) and it won’t even include the $15 of DLC that have been released so far. That puts the price tag for the new version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered to $55.

It’s very possible that Activision made this poorly received decision as a smart business move- there are probably quite a few gamers out there that will buy the re-release plus DLC just so they can get rid of the Infinite Warfare disc.

P.s. I don't even own an Xbox and I knew all these features.",https://fraghero.com/10-things-didnt-know-xbox-one/,"Gone are the days when consoles were just simple boxes that had an On or Off Button. Nowadays they are transformed into complex machines that feature all kinds of interesting characteristics, social aspects and online connectivity meant to make the gameplay even more enjoyable than before. If you are curious about what your Xbox One packs inside, here are 10 of the most interesting things you didn’t know your favorite console could do.

Connect a Keyboard



Connecting a keyboard to your Xbox One might seem like an unintuitive thing to do since the whole point of using a console is sitting back and relaxing on the sofa with the controller in hand. But there are situations when such an option might come in handy, for example: a case where you want to write a message to a friend. Even though you might not use this feature on a daily basis, it’s still good to know that it exists on the Xbox One.

Customize your Dashboard

If you’ve gotten bored with the standard look of your home screen you’ll be glad to know that you can actually change various little things to make it more personal. By opening the “Settings” application and selecting the Personalization tab you will be able to access “My color & background” section where you’ll find various options. The background can be switched to any color you want and, in addition, you can even opt to use personal pictures, achievement art or a screenshot that you’ve taken.

Use your Phone as a Controller



For those moments when you get extra comfortable and sink into your couch after a long day of work, there’s nothing worse than realizing that the controller is way out of your reach. Luckily, it turns out that you can control your Xbox One directly through your smartphone or tablet, you just have to install a specific app for iOS or Android, log into your account and you’re good to go. This is a useful feature your Xbox one has and it would be a shame not to take advantage of it.

Customize the Controller



For ease of use or just because you like a certain configuration of the buttons, you can easily customize your controller by opening the Xbox Accessories application and playing with the adjustable settings you find there. After you’ve selected the “Configure” option, you’re free to rearrange the buttons in any manner you like and think fits your style best, because it’s very important to be able to handle your controller in the most comfortable of ways.

Broadcast Play Sessions



This option is especially useful for the aspiring streamers or YouTubers out there who want to show the entire world their prowess in playing video games. All you need to do is download the Twitch application, sign in and select the “Broadcast” option, then it will be automatically snapped to the right side of your screen and you can name it and tweak its settings. It’s good to know that such a feature is available on the Xbox One because it really makes many gamers’ life easier.

Add an External Hard Drive



In terms of usefulness, this option really tops it all. Adding an external hard drive to your Xbox One is one of the best things you can do with your console, because once you’ve ran out of the native 500GB space you’ll no longer have to delete the games or videos you’ve got in your collection. By simply connecting an external storage device to one of the USB ports available, you’ll be gaining a lot of new space to install the newest gaming titles on.

Share Games with your Friends



If you set your Xbox One as your “home” Xbox, all the other accounts that are linked to the system gain access to your games, even when you are not logged in. In this way, individual users are able to set up their own save files and earn personal achievements without affecting the game progression of the other members that use the same console. In the same way, if a friend is willing to set their “home” as your house, then both of you will have access to each other’s games for ever.

Once you’ve setup your Xbox One on your home network you are able to access it from any PC that runs Windows 10, so if you find yourself sitting at your desk and feeling the need to play some games that you have on your console, you can access it in a very simple way. You just have to open up the app in Windows and your Xbox One will be instantly turned on, allowing you to access your game library and choose whatever you’d like to play.

Play Cross-Platform



The dream scenario where you can play video games with your friends even if they are using a different system has finally come true. Now you can enjoy an online match with your mates thanks to the cross-platform feature that allows you to get together with PC users. Important titles like Gears of War 4, Killer Instinct, and Rocket League all let you play cooperatively or competitively against your friends, which is downright extraordinary!

Film Yourself in Green Screen videos



Upload Studio is the official video editor offered by Xbox One and even though it’s a free software, it’s surprisingly resourceful and has a lot of cool features to offer. Besides the usual ones that let you edit your gameplay clips into videos, this editor also has a powerful Kinect feature, namely it lets you record yourself as if you had a green screen setup. This is an extraordinary perk, taking into consideration the fact that most of us don’t have a designated green screen setup in our homes.",10 Things You Didn’t Know Your Xbox One Could Do,2017-06-24 11:00:42

This topic came up due to the forced split-screen in A Way Out (Even when playing online), which requires more processing power.

In an interview with Engadget, the director of A Way Out, Josef Fares, said that the PS4 isn’t as powerful as people think it is, and that it’s holding back game development.

These comments have some console gamers upset to the point of wanting to boycott this game and the previous title he directed, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. That seems a bit extreme. If you’re not interested in the game, that’s one thing. If you were interested until he compared the PS4 to a 5 year old PC, you might want to reconsider.

It’s an odd comment to make, either way. The PS4 came out in 2013 and it’s 2017 now so the console itself is nearly 5 years old. Also, the average PC gamer isn’t playing on a bleeding edge system and a mid range PC from a few years ago isn’t going to be worlds different from a current generation console in terms of what they can play.. It does stand to reason that developers aren’t going to go balls to the walls to max out high-end gaming PCs with their games when most people won’t be able to play those games, but to attribute a lack of innovation to the hardware limits on consoles seems strange as well.","A Way Out dev hits out at the PS4, makes terrible comparison",2017-06-24 02:00:13

The Nintendo Switch games list could be boosted by Rockstar's next release, and we're not talking about Red Dead Redemption.

New reports have suggested that LA Noire might be getting a re-release on Nintendo Switch, PS4 and Xbox One.

The rumours emerged earlier this year, when Yan2295 told Twitter followers to expect a remaster of the open-world detective game.

""According to what I heard, Rockstar might be releasing a remastered version of L.A. Noire on the Nintendo Switch.""

This was followed by a separate tweet which suggested LA Noire would also hit Xbox One and PS4 this summer.

""Regarding LA Noire Remaster, the title is sounding like it'll come to Switch, PS4, and Xbox One. Release slated for late summer.""

The latest update suggests that not only will LA Noire feature new and improved visuals, but also a first-person mode and even PlayStation VR support.",Rockstar blockbuster could be coming to Nintendo Switch,2017-06-22 01:00:32

Weird, right?

GTA V, like GTA IV, runs on the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE). RAGE is a vast improvement over the engine Rockstar used for GTA III – Vice City Stories games. However, as with all physics engines, it does have bugs (as seen above). Rockstar actually updated RAGE with improved water and underwater physics for GTA V, believe it or not. Even though the probability of weird stuff like this happening is lower with the current version of RAGE than it was before, unexplainable video game phenomena can still happen.

However the $500 price tag has raised a few questions about the target audience of the console.

Xbox head Phil Spencer, in a recent interview with Metro admitted that the new console is sort of targeted at the hardware fanatics but not at the base audience. He also added that Xbox One S will sell more that Xbox One X because most of the gamers are not interested in 4K or teraflops.

He said, “We have two consoles in our line: Xbox One S, now for sale for $249 in the US, and Xbox One X, the most powerful console to date. And the majority of consoles we will sell next year will be the S. There’s no doubt about that. Because most of most of the people will say, ‘I just want a console that plays the games I wanna play.’ Our Xbox One S will sell the most because most people are not into how many [teraflops] does this have versus someone else. Most people just want to go play games. And the breadth of games we showed was critical to me, for young and old, male and female. I wanted to make sure we had a great cross section, because at the end of the day the majority of people just wanna buy a console, put a controller in their hands, and play games they’re gonna enjoy.”

This could sound a bit surprising because they have just launched a super powerful console but Spencer does have a point. He went to say that most of the gamers don’t even care about framerate.

“Developers are incentivized to give you the best experience they can. We can both agree on that. So, if they think it’s 60fps and that’s gonna help them, in terms of selling more copies of the game, they’re gonna be all in. But not everybody understands what 60fps vs. 30fps means.”

It seems like everyone in WWE has a big honkin’ announcement this week. Roman Reigns is supposed to make a SummerSlam announcement on Monday’s Raw, and all weekend Seth stinkin’ Rollins was talking about his big stinkin’ announcement on Monday morning’s SportsCenter. Many suspected the announcement would be that Rollins will be the stinkin’ cover athlete for WWE 2K18. And you know what? That stinkin’ thinkin’ was correct.

Rollins will grace the cover of WWE 2K18, which will be his first time as a WWE video game cover athlete. The cover spot isn’t quite as big a deal as in, say, any other sport, but it’s still a nice little feather in the cap of whichever wrestler gets the spot. The other games in the 2K series have had covers featuring Brock Lesnar, John Cena, Steve Austin, and The Rock, so that’s fine company for Rollins. (And the secret alternate Daniel Bryan cover, but we don’t talk about that one.)

This means if you’ve invested a considerable amount of time playing games such as “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” and happen to break the console, all your progress will be lost forever.

The Nintendo Switch has a far greater chance of being broken too, for one it’s a portable home console, and it is also aimed at young gamers, making it all the more susceptible to accidental drops.

Nintendo is the only company that hasn’t been able to come up with a way to secure your save files in case of the console being broken. Both Sony and Microsoft has figured out a simple way: cloud saves. This means your game save files are all stored in a cloud server and can be easily retrieved in case you need to use a new device.

For reasons best known to Nintendo, it neither allows you to save your progress on a cloud server nor does it allow you to back up your save files to a microSD card. Weird.

What’s even worse is the fact that Nintendo seems to be dodging this serious issue. Reggie-Fils-Aime gave a bizarre response when asked about the same:

Not to mention Bethesda’s latest modding issues.

But not even Rockstar, one of the more historically beloved devs, is safe from the backlash after Take-Two issued a cease and desist letter to the people behind OpenIV, the most prominent modding platform for Grand Theft Auto V. OpenIV didn’t impact GTA Online, it was simply single player mods for the game, which countless people had invested thousands of hours into creating to share with members of the community.

Take-Two’s legal team messaged the creator of OpenIV and claimed they were breaking laws. The lead dev couldn’t figure out what laws they could be breaking, and requested more information and clarification on the matter. Radio silence for weeks, and then Take-Two issued the cease and desist. Here’s a statement that Rockstar issued to PC Gamer:

“Take-Two’s actions were not specifically targeting single player mods. Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players.”

This doesn’t impact the majority of players of the game, but it’s definitely a slap in the face to some of the most hardcore and dedicated players, and even people who play on consoles or don’t use OpenIV to mod the game are standing up and sharing in the outrage. Freely modding games you own has been a cornerstone of PC gaming culture since the very beginning, with many mods turning into full, and very successful, retail releases.

Since news of this broke a couple of days ago, reviews for GTA on Steam have been getting absolutely slammed.

The game will run in true 4K which is 60 frames per second. However, one thing that could be a worry for the gamers with this amazing upcoming game is the required hard drive space.

In order to install the game you will need a hard drive space of 100 GB at minimum on both PC and Xbox One X. The game has an surprisingly enormous size even though it contains Ultra HD assets. So, if you are planning to get this game you will have to make sure that you empty some of your hard drive space.

In case you have a 500 GB hard drive you’ll need to save almost 1/5th of the entire storage for the game and if the game gets any expansion soon it is bound that it will need half of your storage.

Forza 7 is one of the biggest games in terms of file size ever. Next in line would be Gears of War 4 which consumes upto 120 GB of space but only after downloading all the patches. Halo 5 also needs around 100 GB after all of its patches being downloaded.

During his interview with Games Radar, director Cory Barlog mentioned that the classic chained dual blades were intentionally ditched by Kratos because they reminded him of his old tragedies in his life. Barlog also went on to discuss about the new primary weapon to be used by Kratos.

He said, “We were experimenting with lots of different weapons, lots of different things. I think we wanted to create an identity, because to me the blades represent a very dark time in [Kratos’] life. They are not just a weapon to him. They are his scarlet letter. They are the marking that somebody tricked him, that he made a bad deal, that he made a mistake. Powerful, but I think also powerfully charged in its emotion. So I think of part of him wanting to move forward is being able to [leave the blades behind].”

Barlog also teased the gameplay mechanics of the ax during the interview. Kratos will now be able to throw the ax, stick it to a particular place and even recall it back. One of the interesting mechanics of the ax would be to throw it behind the enemies and then recall it back such that it hits them during its return.

71,No. It costs just over $150 dollars more than the XBox 1X (prices are as current as June 15th and even the final build doesn't run as well as a console according to the article) ,http://www.pcworld.com/article/3200767/gaming/xbox-one-x-pc-build.html,"Microsoft’s Xbox One X presents an interesting challenge for PC builders. Sure, if you want raw power, nothing beats the PC. But putting together an Xbox One X equivalent for the same $500 price is tricky.

In ideal conditions, that price point already pushes the limits of what’s possible, particularly outside of the golden window of Black Friday sales and stellar combo/bundle deals on PC components. But we remain in the middle of inflated prices for RAM and certain GPUs, as well as a dearth of 4K UHD drives. Faithfully replicating Microsoft’s console doesn’t come out cleanly in favor of a DIY PC.

Still, it’s a worthwhile endeavor—so we’ve not only updated the prices for our two sample builds from June, but we’ve also added a new one using a Ryzen 3 CPU. Moreover, we’ve built an Xbox One X PC. In fact, we built two based on our part lists, and then benchmarked them.

Let’s jump right into the details.

Editor’s note (11/7/2017): This article was originally published on June 16, 2017. The latest update includes our benchmarks of the Xbox One X PC we built live on November 2nd.

Build #1: A basic 4K/30-fps gaming PC

To start, we’ll walk through a baseline build, which makes a few sacrifices but should still perform at 4K/30 fps.

Build notes

Prices current as of October 26, 2017. Retailers chosen with shipping costs in mind—and the assumption most people have an Amazon Prime account. Cheap motherboards like the Gigabyte GA-970A-DS3P FX lack on-board Wi-Fi, so if you want wireless connectivity, prepare to shell out for either a Wi-Fi adapter or a better motherboard. See the Build Summary section for notes on cost. This price is after a $3 coupon discount plus a $15 mail-in rebate.

Build breakdown

When comparing our build to the Xbox One X piece by piece, each platform’s advantages are clear. Our PC has more flexibility and muscle, while the Xbox One X is both highly compact and set in stone.

For the Xbox One X’s CPU, GPU, and memory, Microsoft chose a custom AMD APU that features eight 2.3GHz custom x86 cores, 40 Radeon compute units running at 1,172MHz, and 12GB of GDDR5 memory. AMD doesn’t have an equivalent APU available for DIY builds, so I chose to walk the line between the Xbox One X’s specs and recommended specs for a smooth PC gaming experience. In our build is the eight-core 3.3GHz AMD FX-8300, 8GB of DDR3/1600 RAM, and an 8GB Radeon RX 580. (My GPU choice does have one catch, which I’ve noted in the Build Summary below.)

Brad Chacos/IDG

This configuration nets you a (faster) eight-core CPU, enough RAM to avoid performance bottlenecks, and a GPU capable of 4K gaming at a minimum of 30 fps on Medium settings. (See below for our actual benchmark results.) However, some Xbox One X games may end up running more smoothly or with better visual fidelity on console than on this homebrew 4K machine. Unlike with the PC, developers can fine-tune their games for Microsoft’s console through a low-level API.

For storage, Microsoft hadn’t made the drive speed, type, and interface explicitly clear when I initially put together this parts list. All we knew at the time was what Digital Foundry revealed in its April 2017 preview: The Xbox One X will have a “1TB hard drive with a 50 percent increase in bandwidth.”

I could have spent a lot of time speculating on what that quotation meant: Perhaps it’s a shift from SATA II/3Gbps to SATA III/6Gbps? Use of a solid-state hybrid drive? A larger cache? Instead I chose to keep this exercise simple and selected a SATA III 7,200rpm Western Digital hard drive.

Since then, I’ve had readers tell me that Microsoft is indeed using a 7,200rpm drive in the Xbox One X. (Thus dashing any hopes that the Xbox One X’s $500 price tag includes a SSHD, like in its now-discontinued Xbox One Elite model.) However, when I recently looked up Xbox One X teardowns, I saw a part number on the Seagate hard drive that actually indicates a 5,400rpm drive (ST1000LM035).

With that mystery still unresolved, I stand by my original decision to pick a 7,200rpm for simplicity’s sake. It’s as cheap, if not cheaper than a 5,400rpm drive, and it’ll run at SATA III/6Gbps assuming your motherboard supports it. Some AM3+ boards don’t, so if you go with this FX-8300 build, keep that in mind.

Adam Patrick Murray/IDG The Xbox One X hard drive, as shown at Microsoft’s Xbox showcase at E3 2017.

The final pieces of this build are straightforward. In fact, you can use any reputable 500W power supply (the minimum for this build), ATX case, and Blu-Ray drive. The ones listed in our build were chosen for how cheap they were at the time of publication.

Speaking of that Blu-Ray drive, it’s a far step down from the Xbox One X’s 4K UHD Blu-Ray drive. To stay even remotely near a final total of $500, you have to ditch support for playback of 4K UHD discs. So that means you can’t play your collection of 4K UHD movies in HDR on a compatible TV, if you already own one.

As for the operating system, we can’t go as cheap as the Xbox One X’s included variant of Windows 10, but we can get a W10 Home license at a heavy discount. How? By using a trick that Brad Chacos has mentioned to our staff for a while now: Buying a product key through Kinguin. It works, but be sure to get the Buyer Protection—the site functions like an eBay for software, and that insurance will protect you from shady sellers.

Build summary

You can’t do an exact 1:1 duplicate of an Xbox One X, thanks to a mix of Microsoft’s custom hardware design and slow release of specs. This build is a fairly decent compromise between Xbox One X’s main features and the cost of PC components. It runs games in 4K at a minimum of 30 fps on a Medium graphics setting, supports HDR, and plays optical discs.

However, it’s more expensive than an Xbox One X by $212 (or more, if you’re bad about filing mail-in rebates). It lacks support for 4K UHD Blu-Ray discs. It uses a GPU that’s still inflated in price, so currently you’ll have to shell out more than MSRP or buy a graphics card with less memory. (For example, Nvidia’s 6GB GTX 1060 instead of a 8GB Radeon RX 580.) It doesn’t have built-in Wi-Fi support. It’s not nearly as compact or small. And though I purposely left a controller off the build list (for PC gaming, a keyboard and mouse suffice just fine), you’ll need to factor in another $15 to $60 if it’s a must-have.

Truthfully, now that we’ve updated the parts list with current pricing (as of October 2017), the most surprising part of this build is the price increase for components like the Blu-Ray drive. In June, this FX-8300 system was $652. The $60 hike makes our more modern Ryzen 3 alternative (see below) look just as good, if not slightly better, as an alternative.

Build #2: The upgraded 4K/30-fps gaming PC

Our second build swaps out the standard Blu-Ray drive for a 4K UHD Blu-Ray drive—and changes the CPU and motherboard configuration as well.

Build Notes

Prices current as of October 26, 2017. Retailers chosen with shipping costs in mind—and the assumption most people have an Amazon Prime account. The price for this ASRock motherboard is after $5 mail-in rebate. See the Build Summary section for notes on cost. This price is after a $3 coupon discount plus a $15 mail-in rebate.

Build breakdown

For the most part, this build shares the same approach as our first one. The key difference is the substitution of Pioneer’s 4K UHD Blu-ray drive. The swap puts the optical drive’s specs in line with the Xbox One X, and it also makes this build quite a bit more expensive by comparison.

Pioneer

For the moment, you can’t get around this painful jump in cost. The cheapest compatible processor is a $183 Kaby Lake Core i5-7400, and because only a few motherboards support the Draconian DRM specifications for 4K UHD Blu-ray disc playback, the lowest-cost option is $154. Moreover, Pioneer currently has the only option for a 4K UHD Blu-Ray drive. The short of it is that you have few options for components (and price shopping) if you go this route.

Build summary

This upgraded rig nails the Xbox One X’s main features: It should run games in 4K at a minimum of 30 fps on a Medium graphics setting, support HDR, and play 4K UHD optical discs.

However, like the first build in this article, it has its downsides. First of all, if you build this PC at this very moment, you’ll pay an inflated cost for that RX 580 plus the RAM. This system is also much more expensive than the Xbox One X. At $940, you could buy the Xbox One X almost twice over.

Build #3: A modern, Ryzen-based 4K/30-fps gaming PC

When we first published this article in June, I noted that AMD’s upcoming Ryzen 3 processors might offer better performance than the FX-8300 for the same price. This build tackles that question head-on.

Build notes

Prices current as of October 26, 2017. Retailers chosen with shipping costs in mind—and the assumption most people have an Amazon Prime account. Cheap motherboards like the ASRock A320M-HDV lack on-board Wi-Fi, so if you want wireless connectivity, prepare to shell out for either a Wi-Fi adapter or a better motherboard. See the Build Summary section for notes on cost. This price is after a $3 coupon discount plus a $15 mail-in rebate.

Build breakdown

On paper, the AMD FX-8300 in Build #1 makes an Xbox One X PC clone seem very tidy: It’s an eight-core CPU, which sounds the same as as the eight-core processor in Microsoft’s current-gen consoles.

However, PC enthusiasts know that a huge gulf exists between a true eight-core desktop CPU and the custom part used for the Xbox One lineup. What matters more is the FX-8300’s price, which was $90 at the time of our initial June pricing. That puts it squarely in budget CPU territory.

Now that the FX-8300’s price is rising—as prices do when components begin to obsolesce—a Ryzen 3 1200 ($110) is an easy alternative. Yes, the 1200 is a four-core, four-thread part, but it’s a desktop-class component comparable to Intel’s mid-tier ($180+) Core i5 CPUs. Because we’re building a gaming PC, there’s no point in forcing an artificial replication of specs in order to appear evenly matched.

AMD / Amazon

Going with a newer processor also opens up the possibility of upgrades down the line. Though an AM4 A320 motherboard offers few substantial upgrades over an AM3+ 970 board, it does support booting from an M.2 NVMe solid-state drive. You’re not stuck with a slow hard drive or even a SATA SSD as your only options for storage.

In addition to the CPU and the motherboard swap, the type of RAM is different in this build. We’ve picked the fastest RAM of the low-cost options. Fortunately, that turned out to be 2,400MHz–since Ryzen’s performance is influenced by RAM speed, it’s a nice stroke of luck.

Outside of these changes, this system shares the same approach as Build #1: It supports only standard Blu-Ray playback to keep as close to $500 as possible, and the rest of the components were largely chosen for cost. That includes even the Radeon RX 580 graphics card with its inflated street price.

Build summary

Like Build #1, this rig walks the line between the Xbox One X’s main features and the cost of PC components: You’re able to play games 4K at a minimum of 30 fps on a Medium graphics setting, view HDR content, and watch DVDs and Blu-ray discs.

It’s still more expensive than Microsoft’s console, however. If all you care about is gaming and media playback, buying an Xbox One X will provide that and still leave you $193 to spend on games.

If you want the flexibility of a PC, though, this Ryzen build lays a foundation for a system that can be upgraded over time. Faster storage and a better graphics card will be easy swaps. Availability and pricing for future graphics cards will hopefully be much better than they’ve been since the crypto-currency mining frenzy began.

72,The game will run at 30 FPS. ,https://fraghero.com/ubisoft-shares-bad-news-xbox-one-xps4-pro-version-assassins-creed-origins/,"Both Microsoft and Sony has powerful mid-life upgrades to their established home consoles now. The PS4 has the updated PS4 Pro while the Xbox One has got the Xbox One X, which was unveiled as recently as E3 2017.

However, fans thinking they are going to get a similar experience on these beefed up consoles to a PC are in for a disappointment. Ubisoft has confirmed that the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X versions of Assassin’s Creed: Origins will be running at 30FPS.

Many fans were hoping the new updated consoles will be capable of running the game at 60FPS but that’s not going to happen. Giving some compensation is the fact that the game will indeed support 4K on both Xbox One X and PS4 Pro.

This was confirmed by Windows Central. They have also mentioned some other notable facts about the console version of the game.

I spoke to a developer from Ubisoft working on that game and inquired about the version parity between PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. He told me that Assassin’s Creed Origins will be 4K at 30 FPS on both the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro, which I found a little confusing. If the PS4 Pro can handle 4K 30, how is Assassin’s Creed Origins utilizing the Xbox One X’s additional overhead? It isn’t, apparently.

Bluehole, the developers of smash-hit PUBG, announced via twitter earlier today that they are adding zombies to their game. However, unlike H1Z1, DayZ, or Call of Duty, the zombies will be entirely player controlled. Bluehole has done an excellent job of listening to the community, and this story is the perfect example of that.

Some streamers decided to play “zombies” with their fans. The group was split up into 4 survivors and a TON of “zombies” (regular characters without ranged weaponry). Bluehole’s development team LOVED the idea and decided to make the vision of the community a reality. It’s uncertain when Bluehole will release the new mode to the public, but they have reassured everyone that the development and refinement of the main game is still their number one priority.

In addition, the zombies mode will definitely be separate from the main game- zombies will not be incorporated into the main body of Player Unknown’s battlegrounds.

Check it out:

As you can tell by the trailer above, the premise of the newest Wolfenstein is the same as its predecessors- kill Nazis, save the world. However, past games were set in WWII- Wolfenstein: The New Colossus is set in Nazi-occupied America in an alternate timeline where the Axis powers win WWII.

As cool as this concept is, there are some people who are very upset about the ideas behind the new Wolfenstein. A group known as the alt-right has called the game “racist towards white people” because the game is all about freeing America from the Nazi regime- and Nazis just so happen to be white. 4Chan and reddit have been alight with the fury of the alt-right since the release of the trailer.

There’s a single part of the trailer that the alt-right is most upset about is a short clip where a black woman (who happens to be a leader in the anti-Nazi, pro-America resistance movement) calls the protagonist a “white boy”.

All I have to say on the matter is that it’s just a game- and on top of that, it’s not like gamers haven’t been killing Nazis in games for almost as long as videogames have existed.",People Think ‘Wolfenstein: The New Colossus’ Is Racist For This Reason,2017-06-14 02:39:10

After all, Bethesda’s been announcing a major game in its E3 conferences for a while now. However, fans were left disappointed when it only announced a Nintendo Switch version of Skyrim during its own press con and a Skyrim VR edition during Sony’s.

During an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Xbox’s marketing boss Mike Nichols revealed the reasons behind the lack of VR support for the console:

The opportunity on PC is larger, because the install base is larger and we think the customer experience will be better on PC

This still comes as a surprise since Xbox One X’s biggest rival the PS4 Pro comes with VR support and has a dedicated VR peripheral in the form of the PlayStation VR headset.

Sony showed off a decent line-up of upcoming VR games for the PS4 Pro while the Xbox One X didn’t have any, and now that it’s confirmed not to be supporting VR, the PS4 Pro definitely seems to have an edge for the consumers who’re looking for a console that enables VR experiences.

",https://fraghero.com/call-duty-ww2-will-replace-create-class-feature-instead/,"Some more news has surfaced regarding what we can expect from the upcoming Call of Duty: WW2. This time, it isn’t about which forces you’ll be able to play as, or what to expect from the zombie mode, or which historic battles you’ll be playing through…

The Create-A-Class feature for multiplayer, as you know it, is gone. It’s not going to be a part of this game. Instead, it’s going to be replaced with something called divisions, and here’s how they’re going to work, according to Sledgehammer Games in a recent interview with the PlayStation Blog:

“Divisions fundamentally redefines how players invest in their Multiplayer soldier career. Replacing the create-a-class system, players choose from five iconic World War II divisions each with specific basic combat training, division training and weapon skills. We think it’ll intrigue Call of Duty series veterans, and we can’t wait for our fans to see it for themselves.”

It’s not clear exactly how that will work, but presumably you’ll choose between divisions such as snipers, infinity, and so on .. and you’ll be able to spend your accumulated points on upgrading each division, which will likely have their own unique weapons, rather than upgrading individual weapons to be used across classes. It sounds like it could be similar to the pre-made classes we’ve seen in past games, except now with the option to upgrade them specifically.

From the sounds of it, people are really looking forward to a throwback Call of Duty game that keeps the best parts of the recent entries but trims away some of the overkill, as many believe some of the more recent entries have really jumped the shark.

You can get away with spending a lot less and still having better performance than current generation consoles, and Dell is aiming to cater to the more casual market who still want a great gaming experience but aren’t extremely hardcore about it either.

Dell may be the company behind Alienware, which are known for being on the pricier side when you compare them to other options or building your own…

…but now Dell’s also offering something much more affordable for people who want to get a lot of bang for their buck.

The more you spend on your PC gaming rig, the more you’re dealing with diminishing returns, but on the lower end of the spectrum you can get some incredible performance without breaking the bank too badly.

The Dell Inspiron Gaming Desktop starts at only $599, but you’re looking at $999 for the VR-ready version called the Inspiron 27 7000 AIO, which packs a lot of punch. Granted, all of these options cost more than current generation consoles, but they also blow them out of the water and, obviously, do all of the other stuff you can do with a desktop besdies just playing games. It’s a great entry point for someone who wants a solid gaming rig without having to spec out all the parts on their own and build it themselves.

Also, keep in mind these are just the starting price points for the stock models, if you really want to go in you’ll end up spending more for a variety of available options. You’ll be looking at closer to $2,000 for the really spec’d out models, but that’s not out of line when you’re talking about a higher-end gaming PC.

In addition to new features that will be implemented in the upcoming shooter, the developer revealed that a key feature in its predecessor would not be returning.

According to Bungie, the Grimoire cards will not be coming back in the sequel. For those that are unaware what these Grimoire cards are, they were a type of award players received after completing certain in-game actions (e.g. discovering a new location or killing a particular enemy), these cards could then contribute to your overall Grimoire score.

During an interview with Forbes, Steve Cotton was asked whether the sequel would incorporate the cards that relayed the game’s plot. “The answer to that question is ‘no,’ Cotton said. “[T]he reason it’s ‘no’ is because we want to put the lore in the game.”

According to Cotton, the reason for abandoning the Grimoire cards was to allow players the opportunity to discover Destiny’s lore on their terms, by investing time into the single-player campaign as well as exploring the in-game universe.

“We want people tp be able to find the lore. All the story is told through the Adventures, it’s told through the characters in the world, it’s told through the campaign and it’s told through the scannable you find throughout the world.”

The feature in question, among others that will be added, is the ability to play as a female soldier in multiplayer. Battlefield 1’s first female multiplayer soldier has some fans thinking that it’s about time, whereas others have criticized the move saying that DICE is ignoring realism in order to serve some kind of politically correct overlord – but these people are ignorant to the fact that women did, indeed, serve in combat roles in World War 1, so this addition to multiplayer serves to increase the realism of the game, not reduce it.

Not only that, but this is something that takes some of the most horrific and tragic moments in human history and makes them into a fun game, so let’s not pretend realism is the only objective, otherwise we’d be gearing up to deploy, not turning on a gaming console.

For starters, the console will have a top of the line AMD processor- probably from the new Ryzen line if AMD’s Scorpio namedrop at CES 2017 is anything to go off of. One of these costs anywhere between $350-$450 ALONE, a price point considerably higher than a 500GB Xbox One.

In addition to the processor, the Project Scorpio console is also equipped with an incredibly powerful graphics card; according to Microsoft, it will have 6 teraflops of processing power and will be able to support games with 4k graphics AND stream in 4k AND record in 4k simultaneously.

It will have incredible VR capabilities as well. The graphics card needed for this heavy of a workload would cost around $400 as well. However, keep in mind, Microsoft will almost definitely get a huge discount for buying for mass production for all of its parts.

The two parts (literally just the processor and graphics card) we have a solid estimate on still cost upwards of $700 themselves- that doesn’t even include the storage, OS, casing, etc.

Experts estimate a gaming computer with specs identical to the Scorpio would cost approximately $2,000. Fear not, though, there’s no way the Scorpio will be that expensive. It’ll probably sit in the $700-$800 range, which still makes it the most expensive console in over 20 years.",Project Scorpio to be the most expensive console ever – expected to cost this huge amount,2017-05-22 05:09:00
88,They'll be stuck with 30 FPS. ,https://fraghero.com/bungie-shares-terrible-news-console-version-destiny-2/,"Destiny 2 had a lot of new information revealed yesterday and people were mostly impressed by what was on offer.

However, console users were in for a shock as Bungie revealed some key information about the game.

The developer confirmed that the console version will be locked at 30FPS and this applies even for PS4 Pro and Xbox Scorpio.

Offering some consolation is the fact that the game will support 4K on consoles.

Bungie actually spoke at length about why it chose to lock consoles at 30FPS during an interview with IGN:

IGN: “Why did you make that decision. You’re like ‘We’re going to lock it at 4K/30 max on consoles.’ Is it just like, you don’t want to push the consoles too hard, or why do you make that choice?” Luke Smith: “I mean, I’m going to wade into this, and you [Mark Noseworthy] can flesh it out. The console, the PS4 Pro is super powerful, but it couldn’t run our game at 60. Our game’s this rich physics simulation where collision of players, networking, etc, and like, it wouldn’t run.” IGN: “Yeah, makes sense.” Luke Smith: “Not enough horsepower there.” Mark Noseworthy: “But there’s tons of GPU power in the PS4 Pro. That’s why we’re doing 4K, right? It’s on the CPU side. Destiny’s simulation, like we have more AI, more monsters in an environment with physically simulated vehicles and characters and projectiles, and it’s part of the Destiny magic, like that, like 30 seocnds of fun, like coming around a corner and throwing a grenade, popping a guy in the head, and then you add like 5, 6, 7 other players in a public event; that is incredibly intensive for hardware.”

It could be due to budgets and time constraints, having different priorities, or just not being a part of the vision of the developers.

Sometimes it’s just a small cosmetic thing, or a little feature that might make life a bit easier. Sometimes, people take it REALLY seriously, much more than they should. Whatever the case, some new details about Assassin’s Creed: Origins have now emerged, and a little thing that players have wanted for a while is now here…

This goes back to a petition for Assassin’s Creed Syndicate where players wanted to keep their hood on, instead of having it always-off after completing the game which drove some people mad in AC3.

It sounds like Ubisoft was listening, according to an anonymous source that that is trusted by Gamesradar:

Maybe space, where humankind has had to move after the earth was destroyed, but either way – here’s a new take on the setting.

Impact Winter is an upcoming survival game by Bandai Namco and Mojo Bones set to release on May 22nd.

You play as a man named Jacob who has to survive in a winter wasteland caused by an asteroid that hit the earth, sending dust and debris into the atmosphere and triggering a horrific shift in the earth’s climate. The oceans are frozen, just about everyone and everything is dead, and a small group has to try to survive with the hope that help will soon arrive.

You’ll have to venture outside of your shelter to discover resources to help with crafting things to help you survive, to boost the power of your rescue beacon, and to help you when you have to venture out again into the horrific frozen wasteland. You’ll have to navigate carefully, and plan your voyages strategically, because if you get caught in a whiteout without enough resources or unable to find your way back, that’s trouble.

Your rescue beacon can be boosted in order to slightly reduce the amount of time until help arrives, which starts at 30 days. The exploration can lead you to all sorts of different places, but how far will you dare to go?

To top it off, there’s a very fitting soundtrack that really ties everything together. You might think a snowy world would get a bit boring, but there’s enough going on in the different settlements and areas that you explore, that it shouldn’t feel dull or repetitive.

Impact Winter will be avaiable for download on Steam on May 22nd for $20.",New survival game has a post-apocalyptic setting no one has ever done,2017-05-16 02:41:42

The original news that the FF7 remake was going to be fully voice acted caused some people to step back and curb their enthusiasm, FFVII is a precious game to a lot of people so finding out that there would be changes in the remake caused a stir.

However, it’s recently been revealed that the person handling the voice of Cloud Strife would be none other than actor Steve Burton, who has already handled the same role in Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children, so at least it’ll be a familiar voice for the character.

93,There was a small bag of Meth inside. ,https://fraghero.com/11-year-old-gets-used-gta-v-copy-finds-something-horrific-inside/,"An 11 year old kid got a used copy of GTA V, opened it up, and got a lot more than he bargained for. GTA just got real.

Inside the game’s case was a little baggie filled with meth. Let’s be real, who hasn’t used a game case as a hiding spot at one point or another? Although most of us weren’t hiding freaking CRYSTAL METH and then trading the game in so that a child would end up with them. Someone out there is a very upset mother, and an even more upset junkie.

Here’s a rundown from the mother’s Facebook post:

Today i took my son to gamestop in Tallahassee to trade in games and get some new ones. When he opened the booklet inside one of the pre owned games he ( MY ELEVEN YEAR OLD SON!!!!!!!) found this. A baggie of fucking meth! Clearly the game was not properly checked when it was traded in and because of the carelessness i could have lost a child. Thankfully He brought it right to us and said what is this?

Was this an accident, or is Gamestop branching out to test some new business models to make up for all of the digital downloading that people do nowadays?

Here’s a report filed by officers who were called to the scene, as obtained by Kotaku:

A regrettable google search revealed that the street value of the drugs is close to $500.

Those “M” ratings on games are no joke, but this isn’t even the first time this has happened. Gamestop needs to get their act together and stop accidentally selling drugs to children. They probabally only paid about $1.50 for the trade-in, too. Gamestop also issued a response to Kotaku, as follows:

“We are disappointed to hear about the experience one of our customers recently had when purchasing a pre-owned video game from one of our local Tallahassee, Florida stores. We work diligently to ensure the quality of our pre-owned items are like new. Unfortunately, in this circumstance our thorough process fell short. We are extremely concerned that this incident occurred, and are working with the local police department to support them in their investigation.”

That’s right, it talks about how diligently they work with a thorough process when it comes to vetting their used games. Apparently a baggie sitting right there in the instruction booklet doesn’t raise any red flags, though.

94,"""I'll never feel strange about promoting great games. You should play it on the platform you own.."" ",https://fraghero.com/xbox-boss-gave-perfect-reply-asked-console-wars/,"Image credit: www.wired.com

Phil Spencer took to Twitter to express his thoughts on the console wars. According to the Xbox head, the console rivalry is senseless.

Recently, Spencer tweeted out to Tarsier Games to congratulate the development team for their most recent title, Little Nightmares. Following his compliment, Spencer received a bit of hate from one user, who claimed that it was coincidental that the head of Xbox was promoting a multiplatform game, that appeared to have better reviews on the Xbox One than any other system it was released.

After the accusation had been made, Spencer replied to the user, explaining that people should play games on whichever platform they currently own. “I’ll never feel strange promoting great games,” Spencer replied. “You should play it on the platform you own..”

After his response, Spencer later added that gaming is all about the games, not the system that you’re playing it on. “When specific game discussions turn from playing great games to which piece of plastic I own I feel like we’ve lost the plot a bit,” he tweeted.

This is not the first time; the Xbox head has expressed his disapproval of the console wars. Last year, he stated that he finds it “utterly distasteful” when some ‘gamers’ have an elitist attitude when a game on a rival platform receives a lower-than-anticipated score on a review.

“And I don’t. I’ve been vocal about that as well. I’ll turn it around now. Like, when ReCore came out and there were some of the lower scores that were given, I would have PlayStation fans tweet me, happy that ReCore wasn’t getting great review scores from some outlets. I just thought it was such a negative thing for our industry for somebody to be gleeful that somebody gave a game a review that was lower than what the team expected. And I don’t just think about that in terms of the games that we build. I can look at Hello Games and No Man’s Sky. I’ve known Sean Murray for years, and I said I want them to be successful with the games that [the industry] builds. The games industry gets bigger and better as more people enjoy playing games. And I also think about the teams behind these games, and these are people who spend years of their lives, so committed to the art form of building games. And then when it comes out, for somebody to kind of fold that into a “My console is better than your console” in a very petty way, I find it completely distasteful.”

Regardless of whether you’re a fan of Nintendo, PC, PlayStation or Xbox, at the end of the day the important thing is that we are purchasing a system we like based on preference. But more importantly, that the games we get on our platform of choice are fun.",Xbox boss gave the perfect reply when asked about Console Wars,2017-05-10 11:00:50

",https://fraghero.com/call-duty-wwii-devs-promise-multiplayer-gameplay-wont/,"There are high hopes for the upcoming Call of Duty game. Even if you look at the reception of the trailer alone, you can assume they’re on the right track compared to other recent ones that were completely slammed. Now, the devs have made an important announcement about something that the multiplayer WON’T do, and it has to do with Nazis.

It’s a World War 2 game, with a multiuplayer mode, which means you could end up playing as a Nazi. That can get a little uncomfortable. Sledgehammer isn’t going to shy away from history, but they’re also taking steps to avoid glorying things.

“The big distinction that Germans still make today is that between the German military and the Nazis. We made sure we made that distinction in the game, that the Germans were doing their duty …” said Glen Schofield, co-founder at Sledgehammer.

“We have a great historic conflict of good versus evil,” continued Michael Condrey, another co-founder of the studio. “But to make factions work you have to play as the Axis. In no way are we going to glorify that position, but we also can’t shy away from it.”

We’ve gotten bits and pieces through various announcements and leaks, but certain things are up in the air. Activation hasn’t denied claims that the game could feature historically troubling locations like Auschwitz, and regardless of whether it does or not, it seems apparent that this game is going to hit a lot closer to home than a Call of Duty where you’re jumping off walls with jet packs.

“This global conflict was rooted in some true atrocities,” said Condrey in a statement to Polygon. “The story is anchored in some iconic moments in the war. The D-Day invasion in Normandy was one of those. There are also other things that make the war so powerful. The historical context of the atrocities of World War II is something that we want to tell the players.”

They asked him to give specifics on the types of historical atrocities that will be included, and here was the response:

“We’re storytellers. Part of that narrative is having fans really be able to experience that for themselves. We don’t want to get into mass graves or things like that. I don’t want to get into the full narrative arc, but suffice it to say there is a flux in human history because of the power of those atrocities committed and we want to tell the whole story.”

What do you think, would you rather have a game that glosses over some of the more troubling aspects of World War 2, or if they’re making a game about WW2, do you think they should aim for authenticity in their storytelling? Some will argue that a video game isn’t the best medium for that, others will argue that it’s exactly the right medium.

He has just achieved the remarkable feat of earning his 1,200th Platinum trophy on the PlayStation Network, but isn’t really happy about it.

The reason is that “there is no recognition” from Sony for making this remarkable achievement.

A Platinum trophy is only awarded if a player manages to earn all the other trophies in a videogame. This means you’ve to spend hours upon hours to earn it. Just imagine how much effort this guy had to put in to earn a staggering 1200 of those.

Most of the time, it’s also common for them to send a press kit containing various goodies in order to promote its products.

However, sometimes the ideas go wrong, but nothing comes close to the time EA messed up in its efforts of promoting the Godfather 2 videogame.

In 2009, the company, which is one of the biggest in the world, send out gold brass knuckles packaged in a wooden box as part of a promo for Godfather II videogame. It was shipped to many press journalists.

However, soon it came to notice that sending out metallic knuckles was actually illegal in many states in the U.S, including California, where EA is based.

Here’s what the California law states:

Manufactures or causes to be manufactured, imports into the state, keeps for sale, or offers or exposes for sale, or who gives , lends, or possesses any cane gun or wallet gun, any undetectable firearm, any firearm which is not immediately recognizable as a firearm, any camouflaging firearm container, any ammunition which contains or consists of any flechette dart, any bullet containing or carrying an explosive agent, any ballistic knife, any multiburst trigger activator, any nunchaku, any short-barreled shotgun, any short-barreled rifle, any metal knuckles, any belt buckle knife, any leaded cane, any zip gun, any shuriken, any unconventional pistol, any lipstick case knife, any cane sword, any shobi-zue, any air gauge knife, any writing pen knife, any metal military practice handgrenade or metal replica handgrenade, or any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a blackjack, slungshot, billy, sandclub, sap, or sandbag.

However, some people didn’t like the revelation as they complained that World War II didn’t have female soldiers and hence it is historically inaccurate. However, they’re missing the fact that female soldiers were in fact a major part of both the French Resistance and also on the Russian Front.

Agreed, they didn’t play that big a role in the U.S Army, but saying it’s historically inaccurate is a stretch.

Some people love co-op, others hate it, but regardless of which camp you fall into it – it sounds like the co-op mode is going to be its own stand alone thing, and more than just a fleshed-out minigame.

Two quotes on the leaked advertisement reveal that co-op mode in CODWW2 “unleashes a new and original story”, which suggests there could be a totally separate co-op campaign, although not necessarily – just because there’s an original story, that doesn’t mean it’s not a more arcade-like style of co-op that we’ve often seen in past CoD titles.

Sometimes it really does not make a huge difference in regards to features, quality, or even the community. However, when it comes to Lichdom: Battlemage, the answer is clear to keep it PC.

This game was released on Xbox One and Playstation 4 on April 19 2016, nearly two years after its initial release on PC.

There have been many successful games making the move from PC to console and vice versa, but this one was nothing short of a disaster.

After viewing DigitalFoundry’s YouTube video demonstrating this FUBAR of a console debut, I decided to watch some streamers on Twitch to see it for myself; sadly, they were not wrong. It’s rough.

Continued

The frame rate of this game barely gets to 15fps, and that’s intermittent. There are ridiculous loading times. The Xbox One version displays significantly darker than the PS4 and PC versions. I couldn’t watch more than 10 minutes of an Xbox One streamer before pouring myself a glass of wine to calm my nerves from irritability.

It was almost unbearable to watch. The PS4 streamer had a little cleaner quality but you could still tell that the frame rate was lethargic. I enjoyed watching the PC streamer because there were no issues with textures loading in slowly, frame rate dips, or excessive lag.

This is CryEngine 3’s first game running in full 1080p resolution for the Xbox One. Although this is progression for them, it does raise a flag in regards to playable quality. With nearly two years in between PC and console releases, there should have been more testing and tweaking before releasing it on Xbox One and PS4.

Maximum Games might be the real culprits, though, since they conducted the port. The company did release an announcement about wanting the improve the game to make it more enjoyable for its players, touching on poor frame rates and achievements not unlocking properly.

It’s disappointing because this game looks really fun to play. As a huge FPS fan that has a love for mage-type characters, I would be inclined to spend the $49.99 on it if I didn’t already know that the poor quality would make me want to break my controller in half.",This is the worst PS4/Xbox One videogame to have ever released,2017-04-19 11:00:58

",https://fraghero.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-wont-one-hated-features-predecessor/,"Star Wars Battlefront 2 was officially revealed last week and it seems to have ticked all the right boxes so far. Not only did it deliver on its promise of including a single-player campaign as well as aerial combat for multi-player, but it’s also gone a long way in showing fans it’s listening to their feedback.

One of the biggest steps it’s taking in that direction is doing away with the season pass. That’s right, the game won’t be having a season pass unlike its predecessor.

The season pass got a lot of heat when it was announced as a $50 add-on for the first game, especially as fans felt the game was rushed for a release and a lot of content was locked in just to make the extra buck later on.

However, it looks like Battlefront 2 won’t see a similar situation arise, the creative director of the game, Bernd Diemer confirmed this to Mashable himself:

When we looked at the way Battlefront had evolved over its lifetime, with the DLC and everything, we decided, ‘You know what? For this type of game, season passes are not the best thing. We need to [take it apart] and come up with something better

I cannot talk about the specifics of this, but we have something different in mind that will allow you to play longer, be [more] invested in the game without having a fragmented community

However, when Mashable contacted, EA chose to take a more cryptic stand about the same:

While we’re not ready to confirm any live service plans just yet, what we can say is that we heard the feedback from our Battlefront community loud and clear. We know they want more depth, more progression, and more content. So we’re focused on delivering that in every dimension of Star Wars Battlefront 2. We’ll have more to share about our plans soon.

It all likelihood though, the game won’t be having any season pass as was confirmed by the game’s director, and EA might just be trying not to ruin the surprise as it prepares to make an official announcement about the same in due course of time.",Star Wars Battlefront 2 won’t have one of the most hated features of its predecessor,2017-04-19 05:54:15
106,Consoles will have upgradeable parts and games will have more staying power. ,https://fraghero.com/head-xbox-says-consoles-future-will-like-pcs-reason/,"You could make the argument that consoles have already been moving closer and closer to gaming PCs, first with online connectivity, then hard drives that become easier to upgrade. And if you want to be technical about it, obviously consoles already are computers, but practically speaking the gap between consoles and PCs is going to continue shrinking, according to Phil Spencer.

In the future, Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, imagines consoles that span multiple generations due to upgradable parts and games having more staying power.

In an interview with Gamasutra, he talks about gaming hardware becoming multi-generational, because there are games that have really long shelf lives and are played for many years after their release.

“Console games feel more like PC and almost mobile games, than they ever have. Not visually, in the case of mobile games, but in terms of games as a service.” – Phil Spencer

Thanks to consoles having “.5” versions coming out mid-life cycle, it’s not hard to imagine hardware generations getting more and more blurry.

Phil also brings up a good point about mobile and PC games, and how they don’t just suddenly stop working when you upgrade your hardware. If you buy a new PC, all of your existing games will still work – and that hasn’t really been the case with consoles, save for the occasional backwards compatibility.

Being able to upgrade specific parts in a console, as opposed to the entire thing, and being able to easily keep playing our older titles without having to dust off previous generation’s consoles are two changes we could be seeing in the future that are very gamer-friendly. Even if they’d be charging a premium on the upgrade parts, this still helps to eliminate some of the cons when you’re comparing PC gaming to home consoles.",Head of Xbox says Consoles in future will be more like PC’s for this reason,2017-04-18 14:17:14

Cockroaches love to infest PS4’s, to a point where you’ll even find guides online about how to cockroach-proof your console. Why is it that they like PlayStation so much?

The PS4’s power supply is the perfect little home for cockroaches, it’s easy for them to crawl inside of it and when your system is on it’s got free heating for the roaches. They’ll start to breed and defecate in the system, and eventually it screws up the circuit boards and fries your console.

It won’t light up, it won’t do anything, it’ll just be dead. If you send it to Sony, even under warranty, they open it up and check for roaches right away. If there’s signs of a roach infestation, you’re out of luck. Some repair shops are willing to fix this for their customers, and some aren’t.

Also they mention they'll only do it if the fans really want it, and if it reflects well on the company, and if it helps further what GTA/Rockstar stands for e.t.c. All the usual corporate stuff 😂. ",https://fraghero.com/rockstar-is-open-to-remastering-gta-games-but-only-if-this-condition-is-met,"Take-Two Interactive spoke in detail about a lot of things during a recent investor call and it shared some details regarding Rockstar Games’ policy about doing remastered versions of old Grand Theft Auto titles such as San Andreas and GTA III. (Take-Two Interactive owns Rockstar Games.)

The company made it clear that it’s not adverse to the idea but it isn’t overly eager to do it either. It’ll only pursue such opportunities if it’s confident that it can make the remaster look ‘great‘,

Take-Two Interactive’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, explained in detail about its approach to GTA remasters when asked if games such as Vice City and GTA III might ever make it to current gen consoles.

He assured people that this was something “[Rockstar Games] will decide in due course,” but warned that it “wouldn’t do anything that’s not going to look great creatively.”



The starting point is, ‘Is this going to delight customers, is this going to look good?’. “You know that we’re a company that is not driven first and foremost by ‘Can we create revenue this way?’ We would start by saying, ‘Will this be exciting to consumers, will they be happy with it, will it reflect well on our brand, will it reflect well on our company?’ And if the answer is yes, then it may well be a compelling opportunity. But if the answer is indifferent or no then even if we have an opportunity to make a few bucks we probably would decline. I think that’s the lens through which we look, the actual decisions are made by the labels [Rockstar and 2K].

It’s clear from his statement that Rockstar Games would do justice to any Grand Theft Auto remasters, if they decide to do them. It might eventually happen if fans really want it but don’t expect Take-Two to dive into it for some quick and easy money as they value the GTA brand too dearly to pull off such gimmicks.

P.s. Also apologies for the brief period of radio silence, a lot is going on behind the scenes. Your regularly scheduled programming will continue shortly.",https://fraghero.com/terrible-gaming-trend-needs-stop-2017/,"There’s an issue in gaming, and it’s been magnified recently. Previously, getting patches and updates to games once they were already released just wasn’t feasbable on consoles. Things could be fixed in a re-released or a GoTY edition, but it wasn’t as common of a practice for most games.

Now that consoles have hard drives and internet connections, it’s easy for developers to fix issues, improve performance, and offer updates to players. This is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it means that glitches and bugs can be fixed, but on the other hand it means games don’t have to be as polished before release, and it provides a bit of a crutch to the publishers who put unrealistic deadlines on their teams and rush games out the door before they’re ready.

Sometimes, the post-release edits are major things, like changing the ending of a game due to backlash from fans. This starts to create a really blurry line. If games are art, it is okay to change that due to demands from the consumers? Lucas from CheatCC points out that gamers are becoming too entitled, and bullying developers into making changes due to unrealistic expectations.

“If we want games to be elevated, to be taken as seriously as film and literature, we need to let the creators be creators and let them fail or succeed on their own terms.” Lucas White, contributing writer at CheatCC.

In a lot of cases, that argument makes sense. The tough part can be making the distinction between which problems in a game are due to artists taking a chance and misfiring, and which problems are due to publishers putting unrealistic deadlines and expectations on studios to rush things out before they’re ready. It’s also a slippery slope to try to please everyone, and there’s a certain point where gamers have to sit back and realize that it’s very rare for a game to be in the realm of perfection, and if we get too spoiled due to social media outrage being able to re-write the history of games that are already released, we risk developers being unable to take chances with their creations and facing a watered-down industry that focuses even more on sequels to proven best-sellers and less on innovation.

Pre-ordering games that ship filled with bugs with the intention of patching things up down the road isn’t something that’s going to change until it stops being a viable business model. Glitches, bugs, and glaring issues should be fixed, but when you start re-writing the endings of games or making overhauls to parts of the story that aren’t as well received, it starts to raise some interesting questions.",This Terrible Gaming Trend Needs To Stop in 2017,2017-04-16 15:02:05

Now, thanks to a study commissioned by Google, we know which one holds an edge when it comes to being popular among teenagers.

The study revealed that teens find the Xbox brand ‘cooler’ than PlayStation. However, Sony shouldn’t worry too much, as the core gaming age group between 18-25 years, prefer the PS4 to the Xbox One.

However, teens aged between 13-17 feel Xbox is the fourth coolest brand in the world, while PlayStation ranks a distant seventh. Youtube, Netflix and Google took the first, second and third spots respectively.

The study was carried out by YouGov and Gutcheck, who held three different surveys to come to a conclusion. It involved 1600 teenagers and 800 millennials based in the US. These people were asked the questions between May and July of last year.

3. Motion Blur - mostly used in driving games it blurs the edge of the screen to make it look like you're going faster or to symbolise how fast you're going. Some people like the feature but it depends what game you're player, if it's an FPS you could probably forgo the Blur.
4. Shadow Settings - for the sake of performance, sacrificing the crispness of the shadows is not game breaking and can save a lot of resources.
5. Depth of Field - rendering the immediate environment is obvious but depending on how far you want your character to see, stopping your computer from rendering the long distance backgrounds can save a lot of processing power.

Even if your PC can handle it, why not push for a better frame rate in lieu of unneeded graphics settings? Or why not put a little less stress on your hardware, so that it’ll run a bit cooler and last a bit longer?

Here are some settings that you can safely disable. Of course, try it for yourself, do the side-by-side comparison and see what you think. If you can’t tell a different, you’re all set. If you can, then you crank that setting back up and pretend this never happened.

This one can make a huge difference. For instance, on Overwatch, you can boost your FPS by 30%, even upwards of 50%. Dynamic reflections means seeing shadows in water and other random reflective surfaces.

Executive Vice President of EA Studios, Patrick Soderlund discussed why Star Wars Battlefront didn’t have single player campaign while speaking during EA’s Investor Day event. Soderlund also hinted that the single player campaign might be introduced in the sequel of the game.

The EA Studios boss mentioned that the decision to leave out the campaign mode from Star Wars Battlefront was purposeful. He said that the decision had to be made in order to release the game early to meet the Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

It is notable that Battlefront had content from Jakku which was also relevant in The Force Awakens. The game, however was based on the original Star Wars Trilogy.

Although the game was a commercial success, Soderlund said that he wasn’t happy with the average review score of the game. The game scores 72 in the PC and PlayStation 4 versions and 75 on Xbox One version on Metacritic.

He said, “The one thing that we got criticized for was the lack of a single-player campaign. It was conscious decision we made due to time and being able to launch the game side-by-side with the movie that came out to get the strongest possible impact.” “I think the team created a really good game based on the premise that we had. I would say the game has done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional EA game. So from that perspective, it’s a success. Are we happy with the 75 rating? No. Is that something we’re going to cure going forward? Absolutely,” he added.

Despite not having a single-player campaign mode, Battlefront does have solo and offline ‘Missions’. He also detailed how EA is looking into the ‘depth and breadth’ before starting a new project.

“The depth and breadth is something that’s proving to be more and more important,” he said. “In a world where we want $60 up front and we expect people to stay with us over the course of a long time, the depth of what we offer is important.” Soderlund added, “We have to go back and course correct that for another version if we were ever to build one.”

On the other hand, EA CFO Blake Jorgenssen said last week that they were working on a sequel to Battlefront which will include content from the recent movies and have better and bigger worlds.

Keeping in mind, Soderlund’s comments, it is safe to assume that the sequel will also feature a single-player campaign, which is bound to strike the right chords with fans.

The game’s announcement trailer holds the notorious record of being the second most disliked video on Youtube ever. However, initially, the publisher brushed off the negativity surrounding the game, claiming that it has performed really well.

That statement changed during a recently held financial earnings conference call by the company. Activision’s CEO Eric Hirshberg, who had previously defended the game, finally admitted that the game actually under performed a lot and didn’t live upto the company’s expectations.

Hirshberg also agreed that the game’s sci-fi setting didn’t resonate with the entire CoD fanbase:

Infinite Warfare had a ton of great gameplay innovations. But it also had a setting that didn’t appeal to all of our fans.

He also confirmed that the upcoming Call of Duty game developed by Sledgehammer Games, due out in November this year, would take the series back to its roots and offer a boots on the ground experience.

In other news, Battlefield 1 went on to become the most successful Battlefield game ever made, and it was set during world war 1.

After moving over to Arma 3 upon its release, they were hitting 50,000 active monthly players in Battle Grounds.

After working on Battle Royale for years as a passion project, it’s all evolved into something completely next-level. From “Hmm, I wonder if I could make a DayZ mod?” to having one of the hottest new titles.

One user created a thread on Sony’s Playstation support forum when the problem first arose after they installed the latest update, and the thread became filled with other people having the same issues.

As another solution to that error code, Sony also suggests disconnecting other devices from your Wi-Fi connection because it could be busy, and the final solution if all else fails is “Try Later.” But they haven’t given any tips to fix the broken Wi-Fi problem in particular, as the normal solutions to error NW-31297-2 don’t seem to be working.

Bethesda’s Vice President, Pete Hines, is known to be quite active on Twitter and he rung in the new year by making fun of a prediction made by Michael Pachter that involved The Elder Scrolls VI.

The analyst had made the shocking prediction that Bethesda was planning to announce a new Elder Scrolls game during E3 this year and would be releasing the game in 2017 itself, near the end of the year.

Bethesda has earlier carried out a similar strategy for Fallout 4, which is announced during its press conference at E3 2015 and went on to release it near the end of the same year.

However, Pete Hines has put all rumours and predictions to rest for those thinking that it’s planning to use a similar tactic for Elder Scrolls VI.

Of course, you can still enjoy the game without having to unlock everything, so you save that $732 and also don’t have to spend 2.5 years at it. The controversial issue is basically that the game’s unlocks aren’t really available during the game’s “lifetime”, even if you go hard at it, it’ll still take you about a year.

A user on reddit named bystander007 ran the numbers, here’s a breakdown:

“The average hero requires around 91500 steel to unlock all base games (no DLC/Update content) unlocks. This includes Emotes, Executions, Effects, Outfits, and Ornaments. From there, you multiply by 12 (for each hero) and get 1,098,000. That is approximately 7.32 of the $100 steel packs.”

Here’s why it’ll take so long to do:

“Assuming 1-2 daily hours of playtime for 5-7 days per week, it would take players 915 days or two and a half years – but by then, Ubisoft could have released a sequel already. “More dedicated For Honor players can do it more quickly, but there’s a limit to grinding Steel since the system was designed to reward first and foremost about two hours every day. They could earn up to 23550 Steel in a week, but even so to unlock everything they’d have to play 326 days – almost a full year.”

Some people argue that you’re not entitled to have everything unlockable in a reasonable fashion without having to pay, and others will argue that yes, you are, you paid for it.

The issue of DLC and unlockables can get complicated, at the end of the day we’re in favor of supporting developers as much as possible when they’re being fair to us, the players. Is it unfair for Ubisoft to expect people to pay hundreds of dollars, or to spend years, in order to get the full experience, or should people not worry so much about being completionists?

123,That RDR2 is a prequel. ,https://fraghero.com/crazy-red-dead-redemption-2-theory-has-fans-losing-their-minds/,"After a cryptic hype filled announcement, Rockstar is keeping a low profile in regards to releasing updates about Red Dead Redemption 2. Recently, evidence has been surfacing on the internet, implying that the next installment in the Red Dead series may, in fact, be a prequel.

Late last year, we first reported that Red Dead Redemption 2 information was leaked, shortly afterward, Rockstar Games confirmed that the game was currently in development, with the first trailer revealed a few days after their announcement.

Several gamers are speculating that Red Dead Redemption 2 might be a sequel because of the way the first game ended. In the ending of the original Red Dead Redemption the main protagonist, John Marston dies. If the speculation that the next entry is indeed before the events of the first game, we can infer that the next game will focus on Marston and his crew before they disband.

Earlier this month, a dedicated Red Dead fan, revealed that several voice actors from the first game are all following each other on Twitter. Including Marston’s voice actor, Rob Wiethoff, and Steve J. Palmer, who voice Bill Williamson in the original game. A couple of days later, voice actor Roger Clark, who’s voice sounds very similar to the individual who did the voice over in the RDR2 trailer “liked” a speculation video on the upcoming game on YouTube.

Another telling clue was that one cyber sleuth found a private resume of an actor who did motion capture for “Dutch” in Red Dead Redemption 2, a character that dies in the first one.

Currently, Rockstar has not commented on speculation but hopefully, more news regarding the game’s story will be announced in the coming months.

Not only are you immersed in the moment but often you’re in control of the outcome. Needless to say, this puts us through a roller coaster of emotions more often than not.

Although most of it is fun and games (pun intended), there are some rare scenes which actually make us feel real emotions in connection with the storyline.

Today, we look at some of the most shocking videogame moments of all time that not only proved difficult to play but also left a lasting impression on the player. Note: This feature contains major story spoilers.

No Russian – Modern Warfare 2

The fact that we’ve written an entire article about this level from Modern Warfare 2 is reason enough for you to believe that it’s by far the most controversial videogame level of all time and definitely one of the most shocking sequences ever created.

Terrorism is an actual problem that the world has to battle every single day with acts of terror becoming more and more frequent and well executed. In this day and age, having a level that puts you as part of a group of terrorist invading an airport and spraying unsuspecting civilains with bullets is definitely not a decision many developers would dare make.

Especially, if you’re responsible for creating the next installment of one of the best shooter franchises of all time. But, Infinity Ward did just that and in doing so created a memorable yet courageous sequence that remains videogame’s poster child for controversy to date.

Meet Samus Aran – The Main Character of Metroid

Metroid, an action-adventure game by Nintendo was released back in 1986. The game was the first edition of the legendary Metroid series. Video games in the 80’s usually featured male characters who would be given the task of rescuing their females. Metroid was the one of the first games which featured a female character as its protagonist.

However, Nintendo never announced or let the players know that they were playing with a female character. The players got to know about that once Samus revealed herself by removing her helmet after the completion of the game during the end-credits scene. This was a shock for many of the kids back in the 80’s who were accustomed to controlling cars or playing with male characters.

This new firmware update offers a variety of highly-demanded features, including support for an external hard drive, modifications to PlayStation VR, and custom wallpapers just to name a few. However, many PS4 owners have reported several issues with update 4.50.

According to several PS4 users, on the official PlayStation Forums, update 4.50 is causing some annoying WiFi issues. Gamers who’s wireless internet connection worked fine prior to the update are now reporting connectivity issues with their console, resulting in major lag and issues joining online matches.

To combat these issues. here are a few do it yourself solutions:

Switch your wireless router’s signal support from B/G/N to just B/G. This workaround requires accessing your wireless router’s internal settings by typing the IP address of your wireless router directly into your web browser and entering the username and password.

Some users are reporting success after disabling their router’s wireless password or switching security from WPA2 to something different. Fair warning, though the WiFi issues are not worth compromising your wireless security.

If none of the above work, then connect your PlayStation 4 physically through a network cable.

Currently, Sony has not commented on the update 4.50 WiFi controversy. But hopefully, they are working hard on making a patch to address the issue.",The Latest PS4 Firmware Update Is Causing This Serious Problem,2017-03-18 13:42:08

In the last week there were many reports that the game had been facing several issues regarding the budget and the release date was expected to be around 2020.

On the other hand, there have also been rumors regarding the location the the game would be based in. The rumors have started to increase lately and one city is getting the most coverage right now. It also makes sense since Rockstar did explore it in one of its previous versions. There was also an Easter Egg regarding this in GTA 5.

We’re talking about none other than the city of London. It might be the perfect GTA VI location with its diverse culture and great humor. However, one thing that might stand between London and GTA 6 is UK’s real life gun laws.

It is almost unlikely that Rockstar Games would go back to London because they had already made a London based game called GTA London 1969.

So, at this point we can consider the release year of the game to be 2020 and nothing has been finalized on the location yet while these rumors do add to one’s curiosity.",Rumor: GTA VI’s apparent location revealed and it’s not where you’d expect,2017-03-18 06:48:41

",https://fraghero.com/8-things-gamers-lie-about-while-playing-videogames/,"Prepare a list of gamers who have never lied, and it might just be a short list. Almost every gamer has told a fib including even me, the great Vikram the merciful, and I’ve been mashing thumb since the age of seven.

Be it beating a boss, finding a secret tunnel, or blaming your poor connection for a loss, lies have been prevalent in gaming since the early 1800’s.

Let us look at some of such lies which are widely used by gamers.

1. Boasts About Having A Higher K/D Ratio

K/D Ratio means the Kills and Deaths Ratio. K/D ratio is a number which is derived after dividing the total number of kills with the total number of deaths. For example if you get 10 kills in a game and die 5 times your K/D ratio is 2.

K/D ratio is actually a status symbol among the gamers, hence they lie about it all the time. There are lot a gamers who never reveal their K/D ratio to others and lies about having a better ratio than they actually have.

2. Blames Lag

This is one of the most common lies that a gamer uses when they lose a multiplayer game. There are a lot of gamers who feel that they can never be beaten unless there is lag. It’s kind of instinctive now for most of us to blame lag despite having a good connection. Maybe you should blame your newb skills, blaming lag salvages some pride despite losing or getting killed.

3. Accusing Others Of Cheating Or Hacking

This lie is prevalent in multiplayer gaming scenarios. Everyone knows that there can always be gamers who have better skills than the others but only a few of them will agree. Anyone who plays better gets called a cheater or hacker or gets accuused of using an exploit to win the match.

If you are a good player, you should have definitely been called a hacker more than a few times.

",https://fraghero.com/8-pointless-things-gamers-do-that-have-no-real-use-whatsoever/,"Don’t we love videogames? They can get quite immersive at times. So immersive in fact that the lines between virtual and real are blurred to the extent that we fail to see the difference between them. This in turn compiles us to carry out real life actions while playing them with the rather absurd idea that it somehow impacts the outcome within the game.

Does it make any bloody sense? Nope. But does almost every gamer end up doing it anyways? Hell yes. This is the beauty of games, you tend to get so invested that you don’t bother making a fool of yourself by doing such things.

Today, we look at 8 such common things that we have all done at some point while playing our favorite games and then looked back only to realize how stupid we are for doing them. Then we go and repeat them all over again. It’s an endless cycle. No really.

Pressing X while at the loading screen

This is perhaps the most common thing we tend to do. Games, especially current-gen ones, often come with huge open worlds or complex algorithms that requires loading screens between sequences. This can be termed as being a necessary evil and they tend to create a disconnect from an otherwise immersive experience.

No one likes to encounter a loading screen which…well…refuses to load quickly. The best way to ensure it does? Repeatedly pressing the X button of course. Many independent researchers have concluded that it actually tends to work as hundreds of gamers have claimed in the studies, that by pressing X continuously at the loading screen, it loaded faster.

Of course, the studies have no proof that not pressing it would have made it load any slower, but try telling this to the gamers.

Shouting at players while playing Football Games

This is just a dumber version of shouting at real life football players while watching a match. We’ve all had that intense FIFA session with our pals when our virtual avatars make a terrible mistake resulting in the opposition getting an upper hand.

The quickest way to fix such a situation is of course shouting on top of our lungs the choicest of abuses aimed towards the guilty player inside our TV screens. The virtual guy who is the result of someone’s code is definitely going to improve his play due to it. And hey, we’re definitely not the ones controlling his in-game actions. Tsk. Tsk.

Did anyone mention logic? Such a pity. We all know it always works and no matter what anyone thinks or says, we’ll continue to do it.

Trying to lean in real life to look through corners

Realism and videogames go hand in hand. With shooters such as Battlefield 4, Crysis 3 and Black Ops 3 blurring the lines between virtual and real, it is only natural for us to carry out some real life movements while playing them.

The most common of these is when we’re trying to look through corners, rather than pressing the button that enables us to lean (if the game allows it), we often end up trying to lean in real life, hoping against hope that it’ll give us a better view in the game that we’re playing.

It’s a pity it doesn’t work and we quickly vow never to repeat such a stupid action again, only to end up doing it again in the next round that had gone a bit too intense for our liking.

Pressing the button harder while playing fighting or racing games

Another extremely commonplace occurrence. I daresay almost all of our readers have done it at some point. If you’re old enough to have been part of the hipster group of gamers playing the original racing hits such as Need for Speed: Most Wanted or even Ridge Racer, you must have pressed the buttons harder in hopes of getting that extra bit of speed added to the mix.

It never worked nor will it ever do in future but we’re still guilty of doing it even to date while playing the most cutting-edge of racing games (Gran Turismo 5, I’m looking at you). It’s fun to do and actually makes us feel like we’re doing better. Which in fact makes it useful I guess? Only it doesn’t.

Tilting your controller while controlling your vehicles

We’ve done this one while playing the choicest of racers to games like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row. Every game which features vehicles that can be driven has compelled us to carry out such a real life reflex action at some point of time.

We’re not to be blamed for doing so either (no matter how stupid we look due to it) since some situations demand such drastic measures. That tough corner or sticky situation isn’t going to fix itself unless we tilt the controller adequately.

The beauty of is that a PS4 game called Driveclub actually paid homage to all the souls that tried doing it millions of times without noticing any kind of difference in-game by actually implementing it in the game.

Closing your eyes while playing Horror Games

This one only applies if you’re one of the brave enough gamers to actually play horror games. You’re a hero for playing them in the first place but being brave enough to play them does not necessarily mean you’re man enough to actually see everything that it throws at you.

We’ve all come across that one horrifying sequence that is just too much to swallow. The best way to detach from what follows is to put up your hands on your face trying to avoid seeing whatever horrors the game has in store for you.

It usually ends up with your character being brutally murdered but hey it at least saved you from the trauma of going through the process yourself. Too bad you once again resume playing the game and the horrors can’t be avoided for long.

Trying to hold your breath in real life while doing underwater sequences

You’ve all done it. Playing Mario 64, in one of the many underwater levels. You jump in and instinctively hold your breathe in real life. Why? No one knows! There’s really no reason at all for it, but there you are, holding your breathe while Mario traverses through the water.

The same applies to while playing countless other games as well. Nothing would make us stop believing that it actually raises our chances of surviving these levels by doing so.

Hitting various buttons while trying to catch a Pokemon

Quick! Hold B on your Gameboy! 1 shake.. 2 shakes.. 3 shakes.. GAH IT BROKE FREE! You and I both know that as a child, you were told by your brother, friend, or somehow conjured up the idea yourself that holding down buttons while trying to catch a Pokémon would help.

129,Blizzard ravaged 1970's Canadian wilderness. Kona is heralded as the next big survival game. Trailer in the comments ,https://fraghero.com/new-survival-adventure-game-might-best-ever/,"This new game puts you smack dab in the middle of blizzard-ravaged 1970’s Canada, a setting basically untouched in the gaming world. You play as private detective Carl Faubert. Your goal? Investigate strange events going on around Atamipek Lake and figure out what sort of supernatural shenanigans are afoot, all while fighting the elements to survive against the odds.

Kona looks like it might be one of the best games of the year and maybe even one of the best survival adventure games of all time– there really isn’t anything like it out there. The storyline is compelling and quite eerie, but it doesn’t go so far as to define itself as a horror game.

The novel setting of Kona also lends itself to new narratives and types of adventure that can be had- not to mention that Kona’s rendering of the woods of Northern Canada is gorgeous. The soundtrack is also unique, featuring Canadian folk music from band Curé Label.

The developers, Ravenscourt and Parable, are planning on releasing Kona later this year to Xbox One, PS4, and PC. It may not (currently) be one of the most pre-ordered games of 2017, but it will no doubt be a contender for Game of the Year.

Lovely reply to fan letter in the comments ,https://fraghero.com/blizzard-confims-overwatch-character-autistic/,"Blizzard has done a lot to be very inclusive in Overwatch and they have put together a very diverse cast of characters. Sometimes, people complain about it or say that it feels kind of shoehorned in, but they’ve also earned a lot of praise for these decisions and made a lot of people feel more represented in gaming, or in this game at least.

The aspects of social awareness don’t have an impact on the gameplay itself and there’s no story mode, so it should be the type of thing you either don’t really care about, or that you think is great. It’s hard to understand why people are getting truly upset over this Overwatch lore. From plus-size characters, to LGBT characters, and now an autistic character, Blizzard isn’t afraid to tackle themes that you generally don’t find in AAA video games.

Imagine you’re an autistic kid, you have a tough day at school, maybe people give you a hard time and you don’t always fit in with your peers, you just want to come home and take your mind off things with your favorite games, and then you find out that there’s a character that is like you.

Niantic, the makers of the cultural phenomenon Pokémon Go, have just announced that Mew, Mewtwo, Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres will all make their way into the game by the end of 2017. Their release may seem far away, but Niantic plans to make these legendaries worth the wait.

Niantic made a similar decision with their release of Ditto- they decided to keep Ditto out of the game for a while so when they finally put it out, they could make it special. I assume something similar will happen with the legendaries.

They will either release in special events around the world or each legendary will have their own unique mechanic, perhaps one similar to the tasks you have to complete to catch all the Regi’s in Pokémon Sapphire/Ruby/Emerald.

134,It's a fan theory that the small town of Rorikstead is sacrificing young fertile woman to the daedra for fertile lands and profitability. It makes sense as there are clues that lead to it but it's not confirmed by Bethesda. ,https://fraghero.com/skyrim-player-discovers-longest-kept-secret-hidden-plain-sight/,"There’s a dark, hidden story hiding behind a seemingly innocent little town in Skyrim…

It all goes back to Lokir, the other guy who was captured at the start of the game…

We find out that Lokir dislikes both the Stormcloaks and the Imperials, which is a big clue that kind of flies under the radar if you aren’t paying attention. Why did he decide to flee from Rorikstead, a seemingly innocent town? Something’s just not right about that place…

Here are some facts about the town of Rorikstead:

There’s a wizard in this town trying to secretly teach magic to a little girl. Upon inspecting the wizard’s house, we discover he worships Daedra.

There’s a song about Ragnar the Red which dates back a very long time, and references the town.

“Rorik” means “Red King” or “Bloody Warrior”.

In The Elder Scrolls Online, it’s revealed that this small farming town dates all the way back to the first era, yet other villages in Skyrim claim it’s a new town that has just recently sprung up.

Another book, a shipping manifesto, reveals that the town was present in the 2nd era. The conclusion from all of this? Maybe the town has fallen and risen again over time.

Rorikstead has surprisingly fertile soils and bountiful harvests considering it’s size and location.

Most homes have soul gems inside of them.

Many women die during childbirth, despite the fact that the town is home to a healing wizard.

Rorik says he fought in the great war, and had his life saved by a healer.

So, keeping all of that in mind, and a few other points that are brought up in the video, what’s the theory?

The town is actually a secret cult of Daedric worshipers, and it’s unclear how many townsfolk are in it on.

There’s a dialog with the wizard Jouane Manette where he vehemently denies there being any kind of secret to this town, which obviously raises red flags.

The fertile mothers who are dying are actually being sacrificed for fertile land. One woman is still alive because she’s too old to be fertile, along with two twin sisters who are alive because they’re too young.

This could explain how the town rises and falls. If they stop doing sacrifices, it would anger the Daedrics. If they keep sacrificing, they aren’t able to grow their population or give birth to future generations of citizens.

Is the town mage teaching magic to the little girl so that she can someday take over the duties of sacrificing fertile woman?

ESO on Youtube, who came up with this theory, says it ties together all the strange loose ends and items in the town.

The developers Hello Games and it’s founder Sean Murray largely avoided discussing in public what exactly went wrong with the game, and were radio silent for months after it release. This led to a lot of fan outrage which eventually mellowed down.

Fast forward a few months, and Sean was finally willing to disclose a few new details during GDC 2017 about what exactly went wrong. Murray disclosed that his team made a very poor prediction about the concurrent players who’ll play the game on launch day.

It predicted the maximum number to be 14,000 while the actual number went on to become 500000 concurrent users. 250,000 of those were playing on various diff PC configurations.

Murray further revealed that the company’s networking team, which comprised of only one staff member, was overwhelmed by the response and struggled to keep things together. This inexperience led to several issues during the early days of the game.

Murray stated – “It was far beyond what I’d experienced before, in terms of people playing a game.”

Murray also disclosed that the studio he ran (Hello Games) comprised of only nine employees over the last five years and revealed that the actual world-building data of No Man’s Sky was only 300MB at launch. The rest of the 2GB (which was the game’s size at launch) consisted of pre-baked UI assets and audio files.

He also said that the studio was running out of money while making the game which proved to be a challenge while “trying to finish something you care about really creatively.”

Although he’s still not given any clear answers for the debacle that was No Man’s Sky, from a gamer’s perspective (it was a huge commercial success), he’s definitely provided some insight about went wrong.

Sometimes, cheaters win. At least in the short term. But on Steam, they’re dishing out long-term punishments that you’ll have to wear as a badge of shame if you’re caught by the VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat). In addition to that, you’ll have to buy a new license for the game, since your old one will be burned when you’re busted.

If you’re caught cheating, you can still use your Steam account and play other games, but everyone will know you were a cheater, and many of them will subscribe to the “Once a cheater, always a cheater” mantra. If you’re doing well in another game, people will reference the fact that you’ve already been caught cheating, and it’ll follow you around, tainting all of your accomplishments, like a pro athlete who is caught using performance enhancing drugs later in their career and ends up tarnishing all of their other accomplishments. It puts an * next to every high score you achieve.

But it doesn’t last forever, it goes away after a set amount of time. So, you don’t have to live with a mistake you made in your early teens once you’re in your twenties.

Many children, including those spending time waiting in the hospital, use video games as a way to pass the time. Tragically, a thief in New Zealand recently took it upon themselves to steal a PlayStation 4 from the oncology ward of Wellington Hospital. The donated console was used by many of the patients as a distraction during their stays for various treatments. One patient, nine-year-old Angus Little, regularly played Minecraft on this console during his weekly chemotherapy visits for an inoperable brain tumor. When asked his feeling on the theft, Little commented,“I’m angry, and pretty annoyed because it was a good distraction for me, and other kids too.”

All is not lost, though! Due to considerable donations, the hospital manged to raise more than $5,000 thanks in part to Little’s Facebook page. Alongside this money, twelve consoles and fifteen games were donated to Wellington Hospital. Little’s school, the Rata St. School in Naenae, also helped to raise money in the form of a lunchtime event. The money raised, which originally was meant to help the hospital buy another PlayStation, has now been given to Little’s family.

There is no excuse for someone to do something this cruel to a group of children, but it’s great to see how others have reacted to it. What are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments below!

That’s because, the current record held by an Australian named Okan Kaya, holds the record for continuously playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 for five-and-a-half days at a stretch. FIVE freaking days, man.

Here’s what he had to say:

My hands were cramping up and I went through a lot of bandages. I even tried to ‘pad up’ my controller.’

What might have worked to his favor was the fact that Guinness allowed the breaks to be stored. This meant he was able to cash in several of his breaks at once, enabling him to sleep for hours at a stretch.

A large portion of the gaming community is up in arms about the character design and modeling for the female characters in Mass Effect: Andromeda.

The developers of Mass Effect: Andromeda are currently under fire for intentionally making the female characters less attractive than in past games. You might say, “well, maybe the new characters are just more accurate portrayals of the real-life models Bioware chose- it is possible, right?” Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Check out this tweet from @luzariuslive:

Steven Brewis’s character looks a lot like him, even down to the stubble. Then, you look at Sara Ryder- and nothing makes any sense. Bioware’s representation of Jayde Rossi looks absolutely nothing like her. It’s not even remotely close. Here’s another example from Twitter:

Not. Even. Close. Bioware became notorious for this after doing pretty much the exact same thing to the vast majority of the female characters in Dragon Age Inquisition, and it doesn’t look like they’ve changed their ways at all.

Personally, I think this entire thing is a little ridiculous. Female character models in games like Fallout 4 and the Witcher 3 have nothing wrong with them, and they (for the most part) aren’t overly sexualized. Their female characters are accurate representations of the models they are based off of- as are the males. It’s a shame Bioware thinks that they need to do this to keep feminists happy. Intentionally toning down the beauty of models like Jayde Rossi just so people won’t riot is ridiculous. There’s nothing wrong with an accurate character model.

Upcoming Bethesda title Prey puts you in the shoes of Morgan Yu, a man trapped on a space station who is tasked with saving humanity from an alien race. One of the alien varieties you will fight is the Mimic, a weird, spider-like creature that has the ability to take on the form of any inanimate object it sees. As the story progresses, Yu gains the power of the Mimic- he can turn into pretty much any object in the game, including toilet paper.

The ability looks like it’s going to be very versatile. Demos show players using the Mimic ability to reach areas they wouldn’t otherwise be able to. Yu can move around when he’s mimicking another object, which lets him roll through small gaps as a coffee mug or, yes, a roll of toilet paper.

Nintendo has crossed over to the dark side; there will be not only paid DLC for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but also a season pass. A season pass. FOR A NINTENDO GAME. Unbelievable.

However, as lame as it is that there is going to be paid DLC for Breath of the Wild, there is an upside to Nintendo taking the season pass approach. Because it’s been confirmed, theres a chance that Nintendo will continue to put out new content after the first two already announced DLC packs are released.

It does mean that we’ll have to pay more money, but we’ll also get even more top quality Nintendo content.

Get this though- the first DLC pack? It adds a hard mode and a Cave of Trials to the game. I have 2 huge problems with this. First: YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY AT A HIGHER DIFFICULTY. WHY? Second: the Cave of Trials was in Wind Waker, but it was included with the game- there was no good reason (outside of greed) for Nintendo to make either of those features DLC.

The good news is that the second pack actually looks quite good; it will add a completely new storyline to the game in addition to another massive dungeon.

146,Medical syringe. Kinda like the defibrillator in previous BF games.... so not really THAT unexpected after all. Video in the comments ,https://fraghero.com/unexpected-way-can-kill-enemies-battlefield-1/,"When it comes to unexpected methods of slaughter in Battlefield 1, there are things like crashing a zeppelin into someone or lobbing a grenade while parachuting out of a flaming biplane. However, there’s one way to kill that won’t only surprise your opponent, but also make them unbelievably salty.

The method is outlined in this video:

The secret lies in the Medic class. The medic’s syringe doesn’t just have the power to revive fallen teammates from the verge of passing into the void, it also delivers an instant, mostly humane (I think) death to any enemy player it comes into contact with. Doesn’t really matter where you stab them either: regardless of whether or not you stab them in the foot or the eye, the Battlefield 1 Medic’s injection is always lethal.

Even though most other classes are more feared than the humble medic, there is something so satisfying about a syringe kill. Also, I don’t think any type of death is more frustrating than being killed by a dude with a syringe when you have a gun.

One person is quoted that they saw a shop opening new copies so that they could sell them as pre-owned.

",https://fraghero.com/gamestop-employees-are-reportedly-lying-to-customers-for-this-reason/,"GameStop is one of the last bastions of brick and mortar retail hope in a an increasingly digital landscape. The American retail chain operates 7,117 stores throughout the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.

This strip mall staple is often the subject of internet hate, because many consumers believe the publicly traded company implements unfair pricing practices. The retailer is frequently roasted with hilarious memes.



They operate a buy and trade program that allows customers to purchase games, then sell them back when they’re finished. Many customers believe the buy back prices are unfairly low and the pre-owned prices artificially high.

Recently, many gaming consumers have been outraged to learn that GameStop implements a company wide quota policy called “The Circle of Life.” as reported by Kotaku. The goal of this corporate directive is to get people to sign up for rewards programs; sell more pre-owned games and consoles; and primarily to increase highly lucrative pre-orders.

This profit driven directive has created a perverse incentive system for GameStop employees. Each employee wants to hit their quotas, which might incentivize them to mislead customers because they can risk termination by not hitting quotas.

GameStop employees really don’t want customers to come in and only buy a brand new game, because that’s not counted to their quota. They are being guided to push buyers towards buying used, pre-ordering, signing up for a rewards card, or trading in some of their old games.

As reported, Employees might mislead customers by claiming they don’t have copies of a new game or system in stock to try and persuade the customer into purchasing pre-owned or pre-ordering.

Sometimes the prices of pre-owned games can even be higher than new games due to demand. In that case, there have even been reported incidences of GameStop employees flat out lying to customers.

148,They felt the 'Chems' resembled real life drug abuse too closely. The game is released over there now so the issue was resolved but Med-X straight up used to be called morphine. ,https://fraghero.com/fallout-series-banned-australia-reason/,"The Fallout series we all know and love was banned in Australia because the Australian government thought one very specific aspect of Fallout 3 was far too similar to real life and would be a bad influence.

Why? Chems. Chems are consumables that change the status of your character. Taking Mentats, for example, increase your character’s intelligence and Buffout increases strength. Back in 2008 Fallout 3 was refused classification in Australia by the Office of Film & Literature Classification. The Australian government decided that Chems too closely resembled actual drugs. If you’re not familiar with the drug gameplay, here controversial YouTuber Willy Mammoth experiments with chems in Fallout 4 and gives a pretty good rundown:



To be fair, they do look quite similar- Chems are modeled in game after syringes, pipes, and even pills. Med-X was even worse, the Chem was originally called morphine. Straight up. No creative renaming of the drug. The Australian government didn’t take kindly to this and refused to rate the game, effectively banning it from sale. Even after Bethesda changed the name of morphine to Med-X, the Australian government still wasn’t happy. They eventually figured things out, because all the Fallout games are now available for purchase in Australia.

Here was the Australian government’s explanation, taken from the fallout Wikia:

“The game contains the option to take a variety of “chems” using a device which is connected to the character’s arm. Upon selection of the device a menu selection screen is displayed. Upon this screen is a list of “chems” that the player can take, by means of selection. These “chems” have positive effects and some negative effects (lowering of Intelligence, or the character may become addicted to the “chem”). The positive effects include increase in Strength, stamina, resistance to damage, Agility and hit points. Corresponding with the list of various “chems” are small visual representation of the drugs, these include syringes, tablets, pill bottles, a crack-type pipe and blister packs. In the Board’s view these realistic visual representations of drugs and their delivery method bring the “science-fiction” drugs in line with “real-world” drugs.” One of the reasons for the ban was of the opiate painkiller, morphine being one of the chems that would have been available to use by players. As a result of the ban Bethesda decided to have morphine renamed to Med-X. Evidence of this last minute change is the fact Med-X’s editor ID is “Morphine” and Med-X addiction’s editor ID is “WithdrawalMorphine”.

Personally, I think the ban was quite extreme. Even though I understand the reason why Fallout was banned, I think the reaction was quite extreme. The games are already M-rated and anyone playing them should know better than to take a copious amount of drugs like the characters of Fallout can and do. In addition, it’s not like the Chems only give positive effects; taking too many Chems too often will give your character addiction and withdrawal status problems (unless of course you have a perk that lets you take as many as you want without any negative side effects, but that’s beside the point).",Fallout Series Banned in Australia for This Reason,2017-01-23 02:57:09
149,He has found and hacked every terminal but hasn't found the secret yet. Todd Howard (director of Fallout 4) has stated there are secrets in the game people haven't found yet including something to do with the terminals. This post asks for community help to analyse images of the terminals to see if anyone can spot the Easter egg. ,https://fraghero.com/this-guy-found-every-terminal-in-fallout-4-while-trying-to-uncover-games-final-secret/,"One brave soul, the youtuber Lavonicus, took it upon himself to find every terminal in Fallout 4. Why would someone undertake such a mad task, you may ask?

Well recently the director for Fallout 4, Todd Howard, stated that there were some things left unfound by players in the game, and one of these things was to be found inside a terminal.

Known previously for exploring all of Fallout 4’s underwater segments, Lavonicus was no stranger to this type of challenge, and immediately set to work.

Over 25 hours later, and Lavonicus has completed his task. Not only that, but he’s also uploaded a mammoth 1,364 image gallery full of pictures he took while on his quest, which can be found through his steam account.

The information found in the terminals cover all sorts of things, from diary entries, to item logs, to random item information – even plans to murder people. I’ve included a few examples of what can be found in the album below.

He’s done a video and has begun his quest of uncovering the secret but there’s a long road ahead and he might not be able to do in alone.

Despite his efforts, Lavonicus still has no idea what the easter egg might be, and calls on other gamers to assist in his next great task: Rummaging through every photo he took until something is found.

It appears he has literally taken a picture of every page of information found within every terminal in the game, so the easter egg could very well now be hidden in plain sight.

Hopefully, if enough people get in contact to help, we can all discover the hidden secret of the terminals in Fallout 4 that much quicker. And who knows, maybe what we find might shed some light on how to obtain other secrets hidden within the game.

A video of Lavonicus discussing his findings can be seen here, including links to the pictures in the description.

151,"For playing too well. EA have a system that detects above average players and if they meeting a certain criteria that is deemed ""highly improbable without hacking"" they get hit with the ban. ",https://fraghero.com/ea-banning-skilled-battlefield-1-players-worst-possible-reason/,"EA thought they had a flawless system in place to catch Battlefield 1 players who are cheating and using hacks, but there’s only one problem…

They forgot to take into account the fact that some people are actually really good at the game.

The anti-cheating measures in Battlefield 1 have been getting tripped again and again by honest, non-cheating players, who just happen to be great at the game.

Ever since Battlefield 3, there’s been a system in place called “FairFight” which uses algorithms to compare your real-time stats to that of an “average” player, and if you deviate too far from what EA deems “average”, you’ll start to trip the alarm, and get yourself an automatic ban. There’s no human looking at this and saying “Damn, that was a nice shot, but looks legit to me…”

If you play too well, SEE YA!

FairFight also looks at gameplay events that are very unlikely. In EA’s words, “not possible (or that are exceedingly improbable) to achieve without the use of hacks.” But there’s still a flaw there, because statistically speaking, exceedingly improbable is going to happen PRETTY OFTEN when you’ve got millions of hours being logged.

One player, named SpartanHoplite, was banned for going 202-8 in a match using a bomber.

After you’ve got hit with the banhammer, there’s really not much that you can do. Some of these are time-based, so you may be put on time out for a week.

Player’s such as Willy Mammoth who was accused of cheating by many players in the Battlefield community after releasing his unbelievable sniping compilation is exactly the type of player who might get in trouble:

There is a computer algorithm that is stopping people from playing a game they purchased, without any human intervention, because they are too skilled at the game. Let that sink in.

Even players who have logged thousands of hours under the FairFight system, progressively improved from game to game, are not immune. It doesn’t seem to take that into account. Some of the people getting banned are frequent streamers, so there’s evidence that they’ve been playing legit, but evidence doesn’t really matter when FairFight decides to bring down the gavel on you.

This is a broken system, and it’s finally getting publicized. We’ll keep you updated as EA releases a statement and with any updates.

As seen below, a message is hidden within the system’s code, from an anonymous source identified only as the Hanafuda Captain.

This is a reference to Nintendo’s origins as a company, selling distinct sets of Japanese playing cards, known as Hanafuda cards. The full text of the message seems to acknowledge that programmers working on the system knew at some point, someone would dig into its code.

That has been the case with a particular scene from a game called Spec Ops: The Line, which came out in 2012 and was relatively well received.

It’s rated 9/10 on Steam, and 8/10 on IGN. Published by 2K games, you can still pick up a copy on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC/Mac/Linux.

One of the goals of this modern military shooter is to challenge your morality, and to allow you to test yourself to see what kinds of decisions you would make when faced with dark choices. There’s one scene, in particular, that really took things to the next level…

We’re seen plenty of violent and gore-filled games in the past, but they never seen to stick with us because there’s always a kind of cartoonishness to them. Even the more realistic ones. But with Spec Ops: The Line, there’s just something haunting about this scene that will disturb you to your core.

Players have reported having to take days off from gaming after experiencing this level:

It begins with your squad coming across an enemy encampment, but being way too outnumbered to go in there on foot. After some debate, they decide to use white phosphorous on the camp.

155,The mural of mount chilliad describes the story of GTA 5. Explanation and image in the comments. ,https://fraghero.com/gta-vs-biggest-mystery-has-finally-been-solved-after-three-years/,"Image: gta5cheats.com

If you are an avid GTA 5 follower, you would definitely be aware of the mystery centred around Mt. Chilliad. It has been three years since GTA 5 released and there are still unsolved mysteries and easter eggs involving Mt. Chilliad.

However, it seem like the Mt. Chilliad mural has finally been solved by an extremely dedicated and crazy fan. He has thoroughly analyzed the mural and taken the entire plotline of the game into consideration while solving the mystery.

Prior to the Mt. Chilliad mystery, the players had dug deep to uncover some other mysteries such as the bigfoot and the beast mysteries.

Now, the Mt. Chilliad mural mystery has also been solved by the same guy who played a big part in uncovering the bigfoot and beast mysteries. He goes by handle “Sir_Galehaut” on Reddit and is now considered as the mystery hunter in GTA 5.

Continued

Sir Galehaut has done extensive research to come to the conclusion. He has analysed that the mural is a plot summary of the storyline of GTA 5. He has even written up another analysis where he discusses that the storyline of GTA 5 follows the structure of a film rather than that of a typical video game.

Sir Galehaut spent a lot of time finding the meaning of the symbols seen on the murals. When you look casually at the mural, you can see a mountain which can be Mt. Chilliad and an UFO at its peak.

The mural also works as an analogy for the entire storyline of the game, which even includes all the three endings. We can consider the foot of the mountain as the start of the story and the peak as its ending.

The large symbols on the bottom are the three protagonists Trevor, Michael and Franklin, with the first two on both the sides and Franklin in the middle. This is because Trevor and Michael are connected while Franklin isn’t as he made his entry later.

The tunnels which can be seen on the mural are actually the plot threads which leads to some significant events in the story of the game. Above Michael’s symbol on the left, there is a small box which represents his act of demolishing the house of Martin Madrazo.

It gets even more interesting as more details are revealed that directly connects to the game’s main plot line.

Continued

On the other hand, there is also box between Trevor and Franklin’s symbols, which represents the moment when Trevor finds out that Michael is alive.

While we go further up the mountain, a roughly crossed shaped tunnel intersection can be found in the middle. This leads to the two boxes above and the UFO at the top. The tunnel intersection is the representation of the choice of the player at the end of the game. In the option C, both Trevor and Michael survive and the tunnel leads to the UFO.

This means that the game can be 100% completed with the death of either.

So, the mystery of the Mt. Chilliad mural looks like being solved after three years since the game’s release. There would certainly be some more easter eggs hidden in the Los Santos and Blaine County, which will be uncovered in the future.",It took 4 years for this GTA V player to solve Mt.

156,Another player pretending to be a self aware lonely NPC. Video link in comments ,https://fraghero.com/youtuber-records-journey-creepy-abandoned-mmo/,"Recently, while exploring through an old, abandoned MMO, youtuber “vinesauce” came across something a little unexpected. And also, quite unnerving.

The MMO in question, Active Worlds, was created in 1995. It’s a long since forgotten game that no one plays anymore. However, upon playing, vinesauce discovered that in fact he was not alone. Another character, called Hitomi Fujiko, was also in the server.

Hitomi initially appeared like an NPC character to vinesauce, due to his constant repetition of dialogue. However, this might not be the case, as the conversation between vinesauce and Hitomi began to take some rather strange turns.

This included Hitomi describing the loneliness of the world around him populated only by himself, and even pleading with vinesauce to tell him if he existed or not.

Now, this isn’t the first example of creepy events regarding videogames. There are many examples, particularly the Pokemon game in which Pokemon actually die, and the infamous Majora’s Mask save file haunted by the ghost of a boy named Ben.

This particular incident also has a video but we’re still having our doubts.

The video can be watched below and you can come to your own conclusions.

Naturally, this means people are very skeptical as to whether the events vinesauce shows really happened, or if they were just scripted.

Vinesauce claims that none of this video was planned or scripted, and when gamers researched further after watching the video, they discovered a website under the character Hitomi’s name, which appears to contain some hidden messages.

What could this all possibly mean? Is Hitomi a real person with real emotional problems, trapped in a game where he questions his existence? Or, is he just another creepypasta-esque gaming myth?

The video showing these vinesauce’s experience in the game can be seen here.

As seen in the GIF below, RPGs behave strangely after the player shoots them into water. The character shoots the water with the rocket, but instead of just detonating or staying underwater like a torpedo, the rocket kind of bounces off the surface then careens into the air, exploding after a few seconds.

Weird, right?

GTA V, like GTA IV, runs on the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE). RAGE is a vast improvement over the engine Rockstar used for GTA III – Vice City Stories games. However, as with all physics engines, it does have bugs (as seen above). Rockstar actually updated RAGE with improved water and underwater physics for GTA V, believe it or not. Even though the probability of weird stuff like this happening is lower with the current version of RAGE than it was before, unexplainable video game phenomena can still happen.

The massive open world game offered players an unprecedented level of freedom and new discoveries are being made to date.

One of the game’s oldest mysteries was the rumor that there was the notorious mythical creature Bigfoot present in the game. Bigfoot is an Ape-human hybrid creature that apparently roamed the plains of Los Santos.

Later on, it was discovered that it was indeed in the game in the form of a hallucination that Michael experiences however sightings without the use of intoxicant remained unreported.

That’s changed after a Youtuber called It’sTinyTroll claimed to have discovered the beast in one of the game’s locations during nightime.

What’s more he’s recorded the entire sequence of events for you to watch.

As you can see, the guy travels across the Rayton Canyon at night and finally encounters the creature. He even ends up killing him and going close to the beast to inspect.

According to the picture from a Japanese exclusive arcade game Super Dragon Ball Heroes. ,http://epicstream.com/news/If-Nappa-Becomes-Super-Saiyan-Heres-What-Happens-to-His-Hair,"Nappa, the bald-headed ex-sidekick of Vegeta and one of the first villains in the Dragon Ball franchise, never became a Super Saiyan in Akira Toriyama's popular anime series, but fans have been wondering what would actually happen to his appearance if that ever happens. The form is characterized by gravity-defying blonde hair and insane amount of power, but since Nappa is bald, how would such transformation even change his look?

When Bandai released the video game Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi for the Playstation 2 back in 2015, we saw a short dialogue where we saw Nappa asked his partner Vegeta, ""Hey, uh…Think if I went Super Saiyan, my goatee would grow?""

Twitter user MrTrikey discovered what Nappa would look like if he transformed Super Saiyan 3 in Super Dragon Ball Heroes, a newly-released arcade game exclusive to Japan and is the seventh Dragon Ball Z: Data Carddass title. Nappa's hair would transform into something extraordinary, but it's not what a lot of fans expected.

Took him 9 months... ,https://fraghero.com/fallout-4-player-spent-750-hours-to-explore-every-location-in-the-game-and-find-its-secrets/,"Players have an option to explore a lot of things in Fallout 4. The game itself shows various locations to the players to explore, whereas there are a lot of other places which players can explore on their own.

One player, who is known by his online name “The LAWD” has managed to see all the 291 optional locations in the game. It took nine months and about 750 hours to achieve the feat. He even documented his experience on YouTube.

In an interview with Vice‘s Patrick Klepek, the man behind this feat, Thomas (name changed as he didn’t want to be named publicly) said,

“I always enjoyed just walking around the map and running into things and going ‘Oh, that’s not on the map.” He added, “That always sparked my interest.”

He also mentioned that every location has a story, but it depends on the player how he comes up with it.

“You just have to make up your own mind on what happened,” he said.

He also shared some crazy details about how he begun this insane task, challenges he faced, and the secrets he found while doing so.

Continued

Initially he started making the videos for himself and archived them in YouTube. His videos were watched by a very less amount of people until one of his friends suggested him to submit his YouTube channel on Reddit. The idea worked out and he now has more that 4,000 subscribers.

“It’s very motivating to have those dedicated people,” he said. “One of them even referred to me as a daily routine, because I release a video almost every day. […] I went in the space of month from having 20 subscribers, half of which were family, to about 4,000 people. [laughs] A lot of them cared more about where I was and what I was doing more so than my family.”

Thomas also mentioned that Fallout: New Vegas was his first open world or Role Playing Game experience.

“My grandma just said ‘Do you want a game?’ and took me down to the game store,” he said. He added, “Fallout: New Vegas was just sitting there on the shelf. […] Have you seen the cover of Fallout: New Vegas yourself? It’s pretty cool. None of the other games looked that cool, so I went ‘Oh, I’ll pick that one.'”

He fell in so much love with Fallout: New Vegas that he missed schools and played the game for more than 400 hours.

“Had to be done,” he laughed.

That 400 hours with Fallout: New Vegas was just the start. He spent more than 1000 hours with Skyrim and explored every dungeon, bought every possible item and did every possible thing in the game.

“For some reason, these kinds of RPGs, open world games, I just have to complete it,” he said. “That’s why I’m not allowed near World of Warcraft, just in case. [laughs]”

At this moment Thomas has started a video series for Skyrim that’s similar to the Fallout 4. In the near future he plans to explore the optional locations in Fallout 4 DLCs, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Skyrim.

Thomas said it’s going to take him more than two years to achieve the goals if he does a video a day.",This Fallout 4 player spent 750 hours playing the game to complete this insane challenge,2016-12-18 06:18:43
161,Playable female soldiers. ,https://fraghero.com/modern-warfare-remastered-just-added-incredible-feature-original-never/,"Activision have finally done something that people have been waiting for for a long time, and that’s adding playable female soldiers to the game.

Plenty of women play CoD: MW and totally own you on a daily basis, but you’d have on idea because every character is a man in the game. Granted, some women will definitely want to keep playing as the male avatars, because putting up a huge banner saying “I’M A WOMAN” in an online FPS can lead to even more harassment than everyone is already subject to in the game. Yes it’s just a game, yes it’s not real, but why not have the option to play as a character that at least matches your gender, if you’d like to?

In any case, it’s about time that this option existed in Modern Warfare, and it’s hard to fault Activison for going back in time to correct the omission. If they were adding front-line female combatants into a World War 2 shooter, for example, that might be kind of strange, but this is Modern Warfare. Female characters aren’t the only addition to the remastered version, however, Activision has also controversially added micro-transactions.

Here are some reactions from around the web about this latest addition:

“CoD is about 360 noscoping and teabagging… I don’t think it’s that important whether female models exist or not. So, I guess, my thoughts are “meh”.” – GreatBaldung “Cue the “Modern Warfare is promoting violence towards women” articles.” – TouchMyPokemon “Assassin’s Creed multiplayer had female characters from the get-go, back in 2010.” – Kovitlac “Why couldn’t they just give you the ability to play as a woman at the start of the game? I mean it doesn’t change the game to get that skin early on so what’s the point of unlocking it randomly?”

This isn’t the first time that a Call of Duty game has featured female soldiers, however. While series’ like Halo and Gears of War have had playable women for quite a while, it took Call of Duty longer to catch on, first bringing in the option for Ghosts.

162,"Nowhere does it state what these two games are. Only that these two games are big, and will developed alongside TES6 and that they will probably come out before TES6. ",https://fraghero.com/bethesdas-two-unannounced-games-are-massive-just-like-fallout-4-and-skyrim/,"Bethesda has confirmed to be working on two games that are different from their normal routine of Fallout and Skyrim. Todd Howard said earlier this year that they’re “different than anything we [Bethesda] have ever done, but they’re still going to feel like a Bethesda Game Studios game.”

During E3 this year, Bethesda’s main voice to the people, the VP of public relations, Pete Hines, commented further on what Todd said. He went on to say that these are two big titles in the works alongside The Elder Scrolls 6, and he clarified that they are not DLC, in case anyone was under that assumption.

Hines said, “I need folks to understand that we’re talking about big games like a Skyrim and a Fallout 4 and a Fallout 3 and those don’t just happen.”

Completely unlike Bethesda’s typical procedure of going silent for years and years about upcoming games, it seems the company is changing tracks now, opting for being more open.

Todd Howard also issued a statement regarding the development of Elder Scroll VI.

Todd Howard even confirmed himself that Elder Scrolls 6 was already in the works, but he was sure to mention that we shouldn’t expect it before the other two mystery projects. This was later reinforced by Pete Hines as well.

Given that Howard mentioned previously that they were “working on three new games,” it’s safe to assume that one is Elder Scrolls 6, and two are the mystery games we’ve been talking about. Just wanted to clarify that, as not to mislead anyone into thinking there’s another game.

Considering the time and effort that typically goes into a Bethesda game, you’ll have to be held over by Fallout 4‘s newly announced DLC, as well as a 2017 release of Fallout 4 on VR, and of course, Skyrim: Special Edition.",Bethesda is developing two new games much bigger than Skyrim,2016-12-17 13:36:30
163,Lichdom Battlemage. It just hasn't ported over well from PC to Console ,https://fraghero.com/this-is-the-worst-ps4xbox-one-game-this-generation-has-seen/,"Gamers often have the task of trying to decide what platform to play a game on: PC or console. Sometimes it really does not make a huge difference in regards to features, quality, or even the community. However, when it comes to Lichdom: Battlemage, the answer is clear to keep it PC.

This game was released on Xbox One and Playstation 4 on April 19 2016, nearly two years after its initial release on PC.

There have been many successful games making the move from PC to console and vice versa, but this one was nothing short of a disaster.

After viewing DigitalFoundry’s YouTube video demonstrating this FUBAR of a console debut, I decided to watch some streamers on Twitch to see it for myself; sadly, they were not wrong. It’s rough.

Continued

The frame rate of this game barely gets to 15fps, and that’s intermittent. There are ridiculous loading times. The Xbox One version displays significantly darker than the PS4 and PC versions. I couldn’t watch more than 10 minutes of an Xbox One streamer before pouring myself a glass of wine to calm my nerves from irritability.

It was almost unbearable to watch. The PS4 streamer had a little cleaner quality but you could still tell that the frame rate was lethargic. I enjoyed watching the PC streamer because there were no issues with textures loading in slowly, frame rate dips, or excessive lag.

This is CryEngine 3’s first game running in full 1080p resolution for the Xbox One. Although this is progression for them, it does raise a flag in regards to playable quality. With nearly two years in between PC and console releases, there should have been more testing and tweaking before releasing it on Xbox One and PS4.

Maximum Games might be the real culprits, though, since they conducted the port. The company did release an announcement about wanting the improve the game to make it more enjoyable for its players, touching on poor frame rates and achievements not unlocking properly.

It’s disappointing because this game looks really fun to play. As a huge FPS fan that has a love for mage-type characters, I would be inclined to spend the $49.99 on it if I didn’t already know that the poor quality would make me want to break my controller in half.",This is the worst PS4/Xbox One videogame to have ever released,2016-12-17 13:03:26
164,Fastest marriage (3 minutes 37 seconds). ,https://fraghero.com/skyrim-player-has-officially-made-the-weirdest-videogame-record-ever/,"There is a saying that you shouldn’t rush into marriages. However, there is a contest in Skyrim which needs the players to speed-run all the way for marrying as fast as they can.

I have seen a lot of instances of speed-running in the past but this is the funniest/weirdest of all. There is an entire category of speed-running, where the players need to get married as quickly as possible right after the start of the game.

The chart is now led by Twitch streamer 5exual_Tyrannosaurus, who managed to marry Marcurio of Riften in just 3:37. That was really fast and Marcurio is definitely a lucky spouse.

Apart from this incredible achievement, 5exual_Tyrannosaurus has also achieved another incredible feat in the game, which is perhaps even tougher to imagine.

He completed Skyrim’s story in just 33:06 and claimed the trophy just a couple of days ago.

When I was wondering how 5exual_Tyrannosaurus managed to achieve these incredible feats at such a less amount of time, I came across a statement of speedrunner DrTChops.

He mentioned, “There is a glitch where if you start a sprint, quicksave, then end the sprint and quickload at the same time you keep the speed of the sprint.”

If you closely notice both the videos above, you’ll be able to find out that there is a small pause just at the start of the video. Well, I have got my answers now.

Apart from the above glitch, there are some more speed run glitches which are at work. Here’s a video by Fivexual, which explains how to make dialogue skips and load warping.

On the other hand, the single player segment hasn’t witnessed a single DLC release since the game launched. Rockstar had gone on record that it would be releasing singleplayer content for the game. That was back in 2013.

To make matters even worse, a new rumor suggests that Grand Theft Auto V’s story DLC has been discarded entirely in a move to bring more content to another popular element of the game.

And yes, we did say completely which means there won’t be any Single player DLC for the game, ever. And the reason isn’t fair as well.

Rockstar has cancelled all its plans to make any kind of Single player DLC for GTA V in order to focus completely on making its standalone online component called GTA Online better.

The rumor adds that there will be new updates coming to GTA Online which has already been confirmed to operate beyond 2020. Just like the GTA Online’s Executives and Other Criminals update, the game will also get new maps.

These maps will be the updated versions of San Fiero, Las Venturas, Vice City and Liberty City.

SOFTSECRETS, the source of the rumor has also claimed that Rockstar has been working on these updates since a long time, but were paused in between due to the limitations of the PS3 and Xbox 360.

SOFTSECRETS however hasn’t revealed anything about the source of the original information. But people believe that the rumor might carry some weight because it was posted back in August and they predicted the Biker DLC accurately.

Moreover, Rockstar pretty much confirmed that it had cancelled development of story DLC when Director of Design at Rockstar North Imran Sarwar spoke to IGN in September 2015.

Right now our focus is on GTA Online which has exceeded our expectations,” Sarwar said. “We currently have all key members of the team that launched Grand Theft Auto 5 focused on supporting GTA Online in every capacity.

If this rumor indeed proves to be accurate, expect a lot more GTA Online content in the coming weeks and months and some of them being the size of expansion packs.

On the flipside, you can consider the single player aspect of the game goodbye as there won’t be any new DLC packs to accomodate new content for single-player enthusiasts.",Rumor: Rockstar has dropped GTA V single player DLC plans for this ridiculous reason,2016-12-15 11:38:15

That house is the resident of a deranged women who murmurs really strange things if you go and try to speak with her. There’s been many rumors about the lighthouse with different players reporting different occurrences when being there.

These range from people claiming to see ghost ships sailing nearby the lighthouse to seeing a ghost of a lady. Others have claimed to have seen a spirit of a old man who was apparently murdered by the lady living in the house.

Activision has another hit on their hands with Infinite Warfare, where they managed to bring some former fans back on board with the inclusion of Modern Warfare: Remastered.

However, they’ve taken certain creative liberties this time around, and added some things that weren’t in the original game.

Some of these features were appreciated by the fanbase and some were even considered as solid new additions, however, the recent mega update that it released for the game, has bought along a particular feature that fans aren’t happy about.

Fans have been vocal about their displeasure at Activision’s decision to add this dreaded featured, and has gone to the extent of saying that it has no place in the game since the original didn’t include it.

MICROTRANSACTIONS!

MW: Remastered now featured an idiot tax in the form of microtransactions, where you can buy supply drops containing cosmetic items like new character skins and weapon camo. At a certain point, we can’t even blame publishers for this, because it’s obviously a viable revenue source for them. It’s our fault that this happened. Every single one of us that has ever pulled out the credit card for a microtransaction is to blame.

But at least this time, it could be worse…

Any of the cosmetic items that you can purchase with real money can also be acquired using the in-game currency that you can earn by playing the game, the good old fashioned way. This could be a lot worse, for example, if it went beyond items that were purely cosmetic and started having an impact on game play, and if the upgrades weren’t available without paying money. Thankfully, we’re not at that point yet, but hopefully they aren’t reading this article and getting any ideas.

Microtransactions weren’t the only additions in the December update, it also included the 6 multiplayer maps that were missing from the initial release, which launched with only 10 out of 16. They’re also added in Gun Game and Hardpoint modes.

As of now, Modern Warfare: Remastered is still only available as a bonus for purchasing the Legacy, Legacy Pro, or Digital Deluxe versions of Infinite Warfare.",Activision adds one of the most hated features to Modern Warfare: Remastered,2016-12-15 01:22:48

The next-gen version of GTA V which released for PS4 and Xbox One contains one such secret. Several players have uncovered this rather disturbing secret in the game which involves you finding a mine.

The mine isn’t accessible from the get go and you’ll need a couple of grenades to blow up the entrance. Make you are far from it or the debris can end up killing you. Once inside the mine, it’s very dark and hence make sure you take a flashlight with you.

What awaits inside is something that noone could’ve seen coming and also if you’ve played an earlier Rockstar Games developer title, it might actually make sense to you.

The mine has a dead body inside and the guy is fully dressed in what looks like a Mafia gang member outfit. However, that may not be who he is. If you’ve played L.A Noire, another game made by Rockstar, you’ll know Cole Phelps, the main character of the game.

Cole Phelps was a detective who wore a similar outfit and died at the end of the game inside a mine after drowning in it. Could Rockstar have intentionally put this body inside the mine as a easter egg for the game?

The outfit and the hat also matches with the one Cole wore in the game. Check out the video.","GTA V player finds secret mine, discovers something he never expected inside",2016-12-14 08:53:34

It also announced a brand new Quake game during the press conference.

Despite all this, one thing that the fans missed during the press conference was the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6.

Most of the fans expected the game to be announced during the event owing to the fact that Skyrim protagonist Dragonborn’s image was featured in Bethesda’s E3 promo images.

However, even though the game was not announced during the event, Bethesda boss Todd Howard confirmed that the game is in works in his own special way.

Speaking to Geoff Keighley during a “Youtube Live at E3” interview, Howard let the cat out of the bag:

It’s good in these moments to tell our fans, ‘Yes, of course we are [making The Elder Scrolls 6]. It’s something we love.’ But it is–you know, I have to be careful what I say–it’s a very long way off.” He added, “I could sit here and explain the game to you, and you would say, ‘That sounds like you don’t even have the technology–how long is that going to take?”

Howard also said they are working on two more projects which will be revealed before The Elder Scrolls 6, which means the latter won’t be coming anytime soon.

Vice President of PR and Marketing at Bethesda, Pete Hines, tweeted that he jokes with Todd Howard The Elder Scrolls 6 will release on 22/22/22. He also added that “our robot overlords will change our calendar system by the time it comes out.”

Although this is not a good news for the fans of the franchise, they’ll still have some other Elder Scrolls content to indulge in. Bethesda announced that there is going to be a big update in The Elder Scrolls Online and The Elder Scrolls: Legends will be releasing in PC and mobile.

Sequel to one of the most critically acclaimed videgames ever made, Naughty Dog has a gigantic task at hand to live upto fan expectations.

The reveal trailer delivered and how, with people showering it with praises, from the feel, to the direction, the trailer seemed to nail down everything. Fans also couldn’t help but notice one major addition to the game: Ellie’s new tattoo.

The trailer heavily focused on Ellie’s hand which now had an elaborate tattoo. Even though the game’s set in a post-apocalyptic world, the tattoo’s quite decent.

However, it’s not just a fancy body art for Ellie. The tattoo actually serves a greater purpose.

As you know, Ellie was beaten by the infected as a teenager along with her best friend. Although her best friend turned into a monster but Ellie wasn’t affected. She was immune to the virus, or atleast it didn’t affect her in the same way it did to others.

However, the bite left a mark on her and in a world where the infected are dreaded mutants, it’s not good to carry such a mark. Almost everyone who notices it and isn’t infected, would shoot you instantly, without even asking any questions.

Therefore, the tattoo made for a great cover up. The tattoo is actually hiding her bite mark if you pay close attention, and therefore Ellie actually has a reason for getting a tattoo done other than it being just a piece of art.",We finally know why Ellie got a tattoo in The Last of Us 2,2016-12-09 06:09:09

Needless to say, the trailer was really well executed and had people’s excitement levels reach an all time high. The Last of Us was one of the most critically acclaimed games made last generation, and fans were really looking forward to experiencing a second installment.

However, one thing that made a lot of die-hard fans think, was how Joel was shown in the reveal trailer.

What’s more, it also gave birth to an insane theory about him and how he’s going to be featured in the game.

According to the theory, Joel is dead in The Last of Us 2, having been killed by the fireflies and Ellie is out seeking revenge due to it. It’s not all hogwash as the theory gives some compelling evidence that can be noticed in the trailer. We’ve summarized them below.

Joel doesn’t look older in the trailer or shows any sign of ageing. He actually looks younger. Ellie is severely bruised in the trailer but there is no visible injury marks on Joel. Joel is extremely calm entering a house full of dead bodies and doesn’t seem concerned about Ellie’s well being.

The theory claims that Joel is nothing but a fragment of Ellie’s imagination in The Last of Us 2, who’ll speak to her throughout the game while she seeks out revenge. Although this theory sounds insane, but it might actually come true.

Since the last couple of weeks more and more details have been emerging about Bioware’s highly anticipated space RPG Mass Effect: Andromeda. Recently, it has been revealed that one of the game’s race has a really bad name.

In the Mass Effect trilogy, the different races had played important roles – the Turians were really clever, the Elcor were emotionally vocal, and the Humans were really terrifying.

However, the upcoming Mass Effect game features a race, named ‘Kett’, which is actually translated into something really absurd if you go by the actual meaning of it.

The word ‘Kett’ is actually a widely used slang in the UK that means ‘shit’. Basically, it’s quite a shitty name to choose for a race.

An extensive title update came to Battlefield 1 yesterday. The players, however aren’t happy with the update and complained that the patch downgrades the PS4 Pro-enhanced version of the game.

The new patch, 1.04 went live on yesterday afternoon and has been under-performing on Sony’s new upgraded console PlayStation 4 Pro.

One of the fans even inquired with DICE engineer Julian Manolov about the enhancements brought in the patch. Manolov, however replied that they were currently under an NDA with Sony and Microsoft which prevents them from sharing any details about the nature of enhancements.



Several users, on the other hand posted on the social media and forums about the game’s downgraded performances after the patch. Some have provided near conclusive evidence too. We’ve compiled the most noteworthy ones below.

NeoGAF user Arthur-Hucksake said, “Jaggy shimmer is now present and a softer image all round. The frames don’t feel as smooth, either.”

Another user named Hurley added: “Just had a few games then on the pro and it does seem like the fps and image quality has taken a bit of a hit. Fps isn’t too bad but it doesn’t feel as smooth as pre-patch.” Jakartalado also went on to comment: “It looks bland, and soft. Textures look blurry.”

One user provided further evidence how the latest patch might have downgraded the PS4 Pro version

BLAUCopter stated: “Was playing all afternoon pre patch and not only does it look softer post patch it runs worse too. Just go play Argonne Forest and run around. There’s definitely a performance hit.”

According to some other users, the developers might have just overwritten the Pro mode flag when they were implementing the temporal anti-aliasing (TAA), which is even detailed in the patch notes. This means that the game is now launching in the base ‘PS4 mode’ instead of the ‘PS4 Pro mode’.

In the meantime, some users are still having fun with the game, this sniper is so good many people claimed he was cheating on social media:

",https://fraghero.com/you-wouldnt-believe-what-rockstar-announced-for-gta-vi/3/,"Since the popular release of GTA V in September 2013, fans of Rockstar Games have been kept in the dark about the details of the next installment of the series.

Related Video: GTA VI: Six Things That Will Make It The Best Game Ever

Many fans have speculated that GTA V would be the last installment due to the ambiguously named “GTA Online” – a name which implies that future installments, at least of a multiplayer variety, are not to be expected.

However, new information from a multitude of sources has been leaked about the next installment in Rockstar Games’ headlining series, including specifics about the game’s setting, plot, features and functionality. As with any pre-release information, this is subject to interpretation and change.

Though no release date has been confirmed, GTA 6 has been confirmed to release sometime in the future. The exact date will likely be two years ahead of the initial estimated release date set by Rockstar, to give them time to “polish” the final copy and deliver an experience fans are sure to enjoy, despite their discontent while waiting twenty-four months more than they should have.

More details have also leaked, read on to know how Rockstar Games plans to make GTA VI the best game the universe has ever seen. (No, really)

GTA 6 will feature a main character – or characters – that players will be forced to control if they wish to play the game. These lead characters will be voiced by an actor, or actors, who will have exponentially more witty dialogue and banter than any of the side characters or miscellaneous pedestrians because they’re just naturally more intelligent, funny, and bulletproof.

The graphics are rumored to be an improvement on those of GTA V, and the physics engine and AI functionality will also be improved to prevent drivers who accidentally run over player characters from reversing and running them over six more times.

Though unconfirmed, there are also reports that large vehicles capable of towing will also no longer take off like the Apollo 13 rocket when attached to a trailer and touched by anything more forceful than a hummingbird.

Much to the disappointment of many players, the game will not be released on PS1 or the Nintendo 64. This has led to uproar among fans who insist their older consoles are “just as good” as next-gen platforms and they shouldn’t lose out on content just because they don’t have access to their parents’ money or the motivation to get a job and buy a newer system.

Though a multiplayer aspect has been rumored, players will require an online connection in order to access it. The stability of the online mode has been put up for debate, however, as almost all online features will also require a connection to Rockstar’s servers which are known to go down faster and more frequently than a cheerleader on prom night.

Some of the game’s shops will have humorous names such as “All Of My Stock is Legal” or “Totally Legitimate Medicinal Marijuana Dispensary.” This has already incited anger among Liberal media and social justice activists for being offensive and an unfair representation of multiple minorities as well as the entirety of the country.

The game will feature a radio with multiple stations, many of which play various kinds of music. Some will also feature talk radio shows, which will undoubtedly annoy every side character, prostitute and ally who enters your vehicle to the point of suicide.

Despite fan conspiracy theories, the game is confirmed to be set on the planet Earth and will not feature laser guns, hybrid jetpacks, alien invasions, or any other galactic planetary entity as a playable area.

Finally, the game will feature mature content, such as receiving fully-clothed sexual acts from sentient plastic dolls, senselessly murdering obese Midwestern tourists for yelling obscenities at you, and partial nudity which will undoubtedly be repeatedly photographed and uploaded to Rockstar’s Social Club by twelve-year-old children obsessing over an animated nipple, or worse, a seventy-year-old altruist’s kibbles and bits.

In addition to these features, Rockstar is said to have multiple downloadable content bundles in the works, which will be free to download but contain items so ludicrously expensive in game currency that microtransactions will be necessary to own anything more than your grandmother’s Buick and an airsoft pistol.

",https://fraghero.com/3-cities-reportedly-considered-gta-6/,"With the existence of GTA 6 promoting more mystery and rumours than any other game out there at the moment, there is one thing that remains at the core of gamers and fans minds when thinking about a new installment. Where will it be set? Even though GTA 5 is still doing well online. It’s forward that Rockstar will be looking.

There’s been a few inklings so far. To name one, could Tokyo by the next blueprint for Rockstar’s series? Maybe. Here’s a few cities that may be the next location for the epic that GTA 6 will surely be.

We look at three possible locations where the game might be going in its sixth installment.

Tokyo:

As mentioned above, Tokyo could definitely be in with a shot at the next prime GTA location. With it’s intoxicating mix of tight streets and neon night-sky, it would showcase the visuals of the game and its graphical capabilities. A good indicator of this is by the different mods that have been released so far for the older GTA 5.

It would also make sense in a story-sense as Tokyo has a criminal underworld led by factions of the Yakuza. But is this too similar to the Hong Kong of Sleeping Dogs? Even though that was set in China, it does seem aesthetically alike. It would still be an interesting shift from West to East, however.

Chicago:

John Dillinger. Al Capone. Frankie Yale. The Windy City is known for its mirrored giant Bean sculpture as much as its violent past. Chicago used to be a town of blood and bullets and this would make a fitting context for a GTA game.

Especially in an updated fashion. It would also make sense being set in the U.S itself as GTA has also been a great parody of America as a country.

London:

It wouldn’t be new to the GTA series, but it would make more a welcome return. It would also make sense to go back in time like Vice City did. If GTA returns to London, it would most likely be that of a different era.

London would also be a perfect premise to stir up a lot more controversies that are common with the U.K and EU.",3 cities GTA VI might take place in that you never thought was possible,2016-10-07 07:06:51

We’re giving this girl a live audition to be our Fraghero Twitch Streamer

We have come across a rather bizarre rumor (Via, Gamology) that GTA VI could be an Xbox-exclusive game.

The rumor mentions that the next installment of Grand Theft Auto could be a Project Scorpio exclusive game. The game, which is expected to feature VR elements haven’t been confirmed by Rockstar yet. In the last couple of months, several sources suggested that GTA VI has been facing numerous delays.

This rumor that GTA VI will be a Project Scorpio exclusive is highly unlikely as Microsoft will have to pay millions for this highly popular game to be exclusive to its console only. On the other hand, the pool of players with a PlayStation console is larger than that of Xbox, which could easily make Rockstar think against the idea.

Microsoft is currently focused more in developing first party games like Forza, Scalebound, etc. rather than the third party exclusive titles. So, we can almost be certain that the rumor is false.",Rumor: GTA VI will be a console exclusive for this major brand,2016-10-06 00:07:37

A warning that the game would no longer be supported in unlocked, rooted or jail-broken devices was already given by Niantic before the latest Pokemon Go update. However, some of the players didn’t seem impressed with this decision.

A message, which reads, “This device, OS, or software is not compatible with Pokémon Go,” are shown in the jailbroken phones.

The players who are facing this issue are now asking for their money back. A Reddit post, made by a user in this regard was highly upvoted. The user mentioned about his experience with the Google customer service while he tried to get the refund for his Pokemon Go in-app purchases.

GnothiSeauton, the creator of the original post said, “I wouldn’t have had a problem with [the update booting jailbroken/rooted/unlocked phones] if they blocked rooted users from launch.” “However, doing it 2 months into the [game] show after rooted users have invested time and money into the game, is completely unscrupulous,” he added.

There is only a little hope for the players who spent money on Pokemon Go to get back their money by using this type of protest.

Niantic has taken this strict step to decrease cheating in the game, which is obviously understandable. However, some of the players think that rooting the phone is no crime as many people roots their Android devices to make them more customizable. On the other hand, there are also people who buy unlocked phone to avoid some extra charges.

Some workarounds for the Android users facing this issue has come up on various gaming websites and forums. One of such popular method is to install another program in the phone which can give you back the access to the game. You can read more about the method here.

Pokemon Go is back on track with the release of the Buddy update, after the drastic downfall it had seen over the course of the last month.

Over the past few years, video gaming has become an expensive hobby. The game companies are now releasing incomplete titles which thoroughly lacks content and then releases paid DLCs.

This new strategy from the companies dig holes in the pockets of the gamers. There’s an option of buying a season pass for the game, which gives access to the expansions, but they too are very expensive.

DICE, the creator of the much anticipated title Battlefield 1, has also used the strategy for the game. To get the full experience of Battlefield 1 you’ll have to shell out a total amount of $120, which is huge.

The price of the base game is $70, but if you want to have all the expansions that’ll come next year you’ll have to pay another $50. Apart from that, the game will have a lot of micro transactions, where you can spend more money.

On the other hand, if you want to get a collector’s edition of the game, get ready to spend an amount as huge as $220. The collector’s edition will have a Collector’s Edition Statue which is 14 inch tall, a steel book, a deck of playing cards, a messenger pigeon tube, a cloth poster, exclusive DLC content, an exclusive patch and a copy of Deluxe Edition of the game.

What is ironic here is that Patrick Back, senior producer of DICE, in an interview with Xbox World 360 had said:

“We don’t ever want to charge for our maps and insisted to EA that this attitude was crucial when it came to keeping our community happy and playing together.”

Six years down the line, DICE is completely contradicting with their own statement and joined hands with EA in minting more and more money.

Apart from Battlefield 1, there are several other games which uses the same formula and exploits the players for more money. If this goes on, the main essence of gaming will soon be lost in the wilderness.

183,It's certainly not illegal yet. ,http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/04/is-pokemon-go-even-legal?page=2,"Pokemon Go has taken over the world, raking in tons of money for both The Pokemon Company and local businesses. But its location-based play has raised many questions about the safety and legality of a game that asks large groups to perform specific actions in public spaces.

What happens when a Gym is placed on top of someone’s front yard? When a lure is dropped in the center of a quiet neighborhood? When someone unwittingly injures themselves on private property? One lawsuit has already been filed against Niantic after a New Jersey man accused Pokemon Go of encouraging strangers to trespass outside his home — will more follow?

Loading

“The biggest concern is that you’re getting a ton of people out in public that would not otherwise [have] been out there,” Josh King, Chief Legal Officer of Avvo Legal Services told IGN. “[They’re] interacting with each other, and interacting with a physical environment, and so all of the laws that apply in the real world still apply, even though you’ve got this augmented reality situation going on.”

“ King “would not be surprised” if someone eventually contested it in court.

With a specialty in media law, King often works on cases that correlate in some way to the first amendment. He notes that the amendment does more to protect the players than businesses.

“It’s important to remember that everyone’s got a first amendment right to associate intangible objects or concepts with tangible things, and that’s what’s really happening when you assign a PokeStop, a [Pokemon randomly appears], or you have a gym,” he explains.

“Whatever the case may be, ultimately you’re associating intangible objects or ideas with tangible things.”

Loading

This means that it’s completely legal for game developers to layer fictional animals or items on top of someone’s real business.

“ The most likely grievance to be filed would be a nuisance suit.

“I’m hopeful that a lot of this will lead to greater and more beneficial social interaction between players,” he says. “But, you’re certainly going to have cases — at least on the fringes — of people who will abuse the system, or there are going to be confrontations and situations that happen.

“And ultimately, they just need to be aware of their surroundings and mindful of the choices they make.”

Loading

So, what does happen when a Gym is placed on someone’s front lawn and their otherwise quiet neighborhood is suddenly overrun with anxious would-be trainers in the middle of the day? Pokemon Go tends to cause people to congregate, which can be a big issue in smaller areas not used to sustaining so many people all at once.

“Game players will have to be careful of that,” he says, encouraging people to practice discretion when entering into a private or residential area.

According to him, the most likely grievance to be filed would be a nuisance suit, which would address the noise or large presence of non-residents in the area disturbing the peace.

He compares a nuisance claim to that of a person complaining about a particularly loud or rowdy neighbor.

Basically, it can be classified as “something happening off your property that impacts your enjoyment of your property.” Whether it’s teens smoking or a bad DJ at a graduation party, any sort of noise level or guest number has the potential to be the base of a nuisance suit.

Something of this caliber could potentially be used to go after the developers of Pokemon Go, he says, then adds that the recently-added feature to opt out of being a designated stop or gym helps offset that possibility.

It’s not just private residences that have been roped into the game. Many businesses have seen Pokemon Go as an incredible opportunity to draw in customers and have begun dropping lures and offering discounts for the various players who might pass through.

Having an influx of people is fundamentally a good thing, but with more people comes a higher risk of injury or claims to be levied on the owners of a business. So, what can they do to protect themselves from the risk of litigation? As King sees it, the laws currently on the books should be more than enough to suffice for now.

Loading

“ ""People need to be able to balance [playing and being aware of their surroundings].""

But what about the players themselves? There have been multiple instances of predators planting lures and using them as a way to draw people in, only to rob or assault them once they show up. In case this happens, what can the player do?

According to King, it’s not necessarily a difficult thing to avoid. In fact, as we talk to him, he continues to return to one major suggestion: be aware of your surroundings at all times.

Loading

“Ultimately, people need to be able to balance [playing and being aware of their surroundings],” he said. “They have to be mindful of their surroundings, careful about where they’re going, and that’s true of how you would interact with someone else or chasing a Pokemon.”

“ “I would not be surprised to see some changes with administrative law.""

We often don’t consider how things may need to change in the face of new tech until long after it arrives. Although we have a decent grip on what virtual reality is here in 2016, we’re still very much learning about augmented reality, and how its ability to immediately add context and meaning to real life can lead us into some very interesting territory. How will it affect us, and how will it impact the laws, if at all?

“I would not be surprised to see some changes with administrative law,” he says, pointing specifically to intellectual property and contributory negligence as being some of the biggest concerns.

Loading

As for Pokemon Go? It’s mostly fun and games, King says. Sure, there are some concerns that arise alongside of it, but the benefits of hunting adorable made-up creatures in the real world far outweigh the potential negatives.

This was pretty much revealed in a post-earnings call, where company CFO Blake Jorgensen goes over some sales figures they’re predicting with the upcoming World War 1 game when it hits.

“We’ve told people that typically a Battlefield title does about 15 million in a year,” Jorgensen said. “Our guidance is slightly under that. And we hope that that excitement builds and it will clearly go through that number. But for right now, it’s slightly under that number.”

He also details a little info on Titanfall 2‘s predicted sales figures, in which he claims it will outsell it’s predecessor. This isn’t too surprising, however, considering Titanfall was an Xbox One exclusive, and the sequel is coming to all three platforms (XB1, PS4, PC). He says it’ll probably sell close to 10 million.

“We think it’ll do more than that, but it’s probably closer to 10 million than it is to 15 million as built into our guidance, so closer to 9 million to 10 million on [Titanfall 2] and just under 15 million on Battlefield 1.”

Interestingly, the two shooters will be released with a week of each other, with Battlefield 1 coming on October 21st and Titanfall 2 October 28th. Something to note is that it seems EA has both fan bases covered this year, with Battlefield being your boots on the ground, and Titanfall 2 being your more futuristic game.

Activision has something similar planned, however. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare covers futuristic gameplay, with the Modern Warfare remaster being the boots on the ground. Something else to note is that Infinite Warfare preorders are dominating that of Battlefield 1‘s, despite its trailer being the second most disliked video on YouTube.

Earlier, there were reports that a copy of No Man’s Sky had landed in the hands of an individual who further sold it to another guy for a whopping $2000. The guy who bought the game has been leaking information about it on Reddit.

According to the comments posted by daymeeuhn on Reddit, the center of the galaxy in No Man’s Sky can be reached in around 20-30 hours after exploiting a resource farming method.

Here are some of his comments:

“Around 25-30 hours. I’m about halfway there. 30% of the 100% distance has been just from the last few hours alone. With a YouTube video explaining how to do this I think someone could reach the center in no time, 20-30 hours easy. “They have implemented some questionable design choices that allow you to essentially “farm” Warp Fuel in an endless pattern and just continuously warp at will almost nonstop, if you so desire to take advantage of it. I dunno if this was intentional, or if they just didn’t care, or if HG doesn’t actually have min/max gamers on their testing team to identify this stuff or what but I figured it out rather quickly and I’ve managed to jump pretty far in just a few hours of doing it.”

You can find the exact method of the process he has followed in this Reddit thread. Remember, this thread contains plenty of game spoilers.

There would certainly be some quicker ways to progress in the game which will be unveiled after its release. No Man’s Sky is a game which is based on exploration and discovery, which will definitely be time consuming.

188,One of the founders of Pokevision confirmed the site was intentionally taken down and might remain that way ‘indefinitely’. They refused to disclose whether Niantic or The Pokemon Company had sent them a legal notice. ,https://fraghero.com/pokevision-pokemon-trackers-shut-due-reason/,"Only a few days ago, we reported that Niantic’s CEO John Hanke isn’t really fond of Pokemon tracker apps for Pokemon Go. He went on record to say that the company might shut them down in the near future.

“People are only hurting themselves because it takes some fun out of the game,” he said. “People are hacking around trying to take data out of our system and that’s against our terms of service.”

That future has now arrived as the most popular tracking app, Pokevision, as well as several others have stopped working. This happened Saturday night and Forbes got in touch with one of the founders of Pokevision, Yangcheng Liu, who confirmed the site was intentionally taken down and might remain that way ‘indefinitely’. Liu refused to disclose whether Niantic or The Pokemon Company had sent them a legal notice.

Pokemon Go is a game where the players are required to travel across the real world in order to find Pokemon. Many people found these apps to be useful since it made the job of ‘catching them all’ easier, however Niantic’s terms of service did not allow this and the company itself feels that it takes the fun out of the game.

However, Niantic currently has no functional Pokemon tracking feature within the game after it decided to remove the location tracker system aka “the three step bug” entirely in an update it released yesterday. This prompted the emergence of these sites and they gained popularity quickly. Pokevision had 27 million people visit its website in only 5 days.

The decision to remove the system from the game wasn’t received well by the community, with many criticizing the company for doing so. To make matters worse, it also decided to block access to its server to third-party tracking apps that led to the demise of most of the websites.

There is some good news for you trainers out there who still want to gain an unfair advantage. Even though Niantic shut down access to their servers, there are some apps that use artificial intelligence and crowdsourcing to help you find rare Pokemon, Pokestops, and Gyms. Pokemon Go Maps is probably the best one out right now, developed by a former google engineer. Since Pokemon Go Maps is built without using any third party APIs it does not violate any Pokemon Go Terms of Service, and won’t jeopardize your account.

After a month of Pokémon GO being out, Niantic has finally come forth and addressed the issue with third-party means of helping players “catch ’em all.” They may be handy for players searching for Pokémon in their cities (especially since the “three step glitch” is still in full effect), but apparently these sites are breaking the rules in order to help Pokémon GO players.

John Hanke, CEO of Niantic, spoke with Forbes and mentioned that popular sites like Pokévision and Poké Radar might be taken down in the future. He also mentions that those sites violate Pokémon GO‘s terms of service since they take data from the game’s servers.

“We have priorities right now but they might find in the future that those things may not work. People are only hurting themselves because it takes some fun out of the game. People are hacking around trying to take data out of our system and that’s against our terms of service.”

Hopefully the priorities Hanke mentioned are to fix the infamous “three step glitch” and stabilizing the game’s servers, since those two things seem to be the biggest complaints players have.

Fans of the game are sure to be a little upset once Niantic cracks down on sites to aid in their Pokémon hunting, but one of the creators of Pokévision, Y.L., said he would be okay with taking down the site if he was asked to. He spoke to Tech Insider about the issue.

“If Niantic told us to shut PokéVision down, we would comply, absolutely. It is their game, and we respect that.”

Y.L. also mentioned that they were not trying to encourage cheating in the game when creating the site. Their goal was to make Pokémon GO more fun, enhancing the overall experience of the game.

While the members of Team Valor and Team Mystic are pleasantly pleased with Candela and Blanche leading their teams, the members of Team Instinct have been a little indifferent about their team’s leader, Spark.

Even though he may not appear to be the strongest team leader, he definitely favors the Internet when it comes to memes. The hilarious creations that have graced the Pokémon GO community depict Spark as a goofy, fast food loving attention seeker, desperate for approval.

Despite the negativity that surrounds Team Instinct, Spark does appear to have an endearing side to him, sprinkled with some innocence. Take a look at some of the best Spark memes we’ve come across so far.

CANDELA: bet u can’t eat 15 crayons

SPARK: BET I CAN

BLANCHE: (sips coffee, checks to make sure 911 is still on speed dial, reads the paper) — ü (@klargtaako) July 25, 2016

Team Instinct boy seems like the type of dude who ran outta styling gel like seven years ago and started using toothpaste instead — Bloody Honey (@BloodyBHoney) July 24, 2016

Despite the humor that surrounds Team Instinct, the team does seem to have an unfair disadvantage in comparison to Team Valor and Team Mystic. For starters, the Legendary bird that represents Team Instinct, Zapdos, appears to have the lowest damage per second (DPS) out of the three birds in Pokémon GO. Articuno, Legendary bird for Team Mystic, leads the trio with 14.8 DPS, followed by Moltres and Zapdos fighting at 9.52 and 8.33 DPS, respectively.

Secondly, Team Instinct has steadily been at the bottom of nearly every poll and survey regarding which team players have been choosing. The less players a team has in a city, the harder it is to maintain control of gyms.

Third, when you gather enough candy to evolve an Eevee, receiving a Jolteon as opposed to a Vaporeon or Flareon can be a little disappointing. Vaporeons are significantly stronger since they receive the most CP per power up out of the three Eeveelutions (+40 for Vaporeon, +39 for Flareon, and +31 for Jolteon). Their attacks provide more DPS than the other two, especially since their attacks are much quicker.

Team Instinct may have more of a challenge ahead of them in Pokémon GO, but that shouldn’t necessarily deter anyone from joining the team. They do have some badass electric type Pokémon supporting them, they carry around a sense of determination, and they don’t necessarily consider everything to be a dick measuring contest, which provides a sense of humility.",This is the most hated team in Pokemon Go,2016-07-29 22:40:29

So you will have to jog at about 12kph to get the most out of an incense. ,https://fraghero.com/this-hidden-trick-allows-you-to-use-incense-in-pokemon-go-more-effectively/,"In Pokemon Go, incense is used to tempt Pokemon to the location of the trainer from their general location. Players are generally seen using incense whenever they are at home, work or any other place where they are unable to take a stroll in search of Pokemon.

However, a Redditor called __isitin__ has discovered that the coding of Pokemon Go doesn’t help the players much who uses incense without any movement. Generally, incense spawns a Pokemon every five minutes when the players are not making any movement.

This spawning rate, however, can be increased to one per minute if the players manages to move 200 meters in between every spawn.

At that rate, the players will need to cover one kilometer in five minutes to get the maximum out of the Incense. The players will actually need to jog at a speed of 12 kilometer per hour to meet this target.

Although on paper they should be able to collect 30 Pokemon while travelling at this speed using incense, the server and the faulty tracking system of the game will reduce it to 10-15, which is also a good number.

So, it is advisable for players not to use the incense while sitting down or not making any movement. Incense is a rare item and the players will receive it for free only while leveling up, and therefore it makes more sense to use it along with the tips mentioned above to get far better results with your Pokemon catching escapades.",This hidden trick allows you to use incense in Pokemon Go more effectively,2016-07-26 05:48:49

Each level provides a handful of rewards based on which level you have achieved, but it appears that’s not the only thing higher players are receiving.

Despite the advantage of acquiring higher level Pokémon in the wild and through evolution, there is something quite annoying that players over level 20 are having to encounter on a frequent basis. It looks like the game is making everything more difficult to catch, including those pesky low level Pidgeys and Rattatas.

It seems that these pocket monsters are starting to master the art of breaking out of Poké Balls; I guess they didn’t get the memo that the game is not necessarily a catch and release sport.

Redditor Riggnaros reached level 30 before most of the other players in the game, and he has been discussing this issue, among others, such as scaling the amount of XP earned and Pokémon diversity:

I dont know how their formula works, obviously, but I can promise you that once you hit mid 20s, you will start to notice even the most common of Pokemon have an abnormally high chance to evade capture. In no scenario should a 10cp Pidgey/Ratatta/Weedle be able to avoid capture from a lvl 29 Pokemon trainer, much less avoid it 5-8 times in the same battle (no exaggeration). From level 29-30 I went through over 1000 Pokeballs. Literally. I cannot stress how ridiculous this would be for someone playing w/o spending coins on Pokeballs (ie playing the game f2p – which is the majority). If they are expecting players to sit around and camp Pokestops for HOURS just to have enough ammo to grind their half a million xp (the requirement from 30-31, 500k), they need to rethink their approach.

As a frequent player of Pokémon GO, I’m about to hit level 20 and I can already see a huge difference in the ability to hang onto my catches. Even with the use of Razz Berries and Great Balls, Venonats and Weedles still break free constantly, even with near perfect ball tosses coupled with impeccable timing.

I’ve wasted tons of Poké Balls, Razz Berries, and patience trying to obtain the small amount of XP and Stardust for successful catches, and I’m starting to wonder if it’s worth throwing over 5 or 6 Poké Balls for each “easy” catch.",Players discover major change in Pokemon Go after hitting level 20,2016-07-22 10:43:28

Secondly, you’ll need to defeat an enemy gym if it isn’t currently owned by your team.

When you totally defeat an enemy gym, you can leave one of your Pokemon in that gym to defend it. While your Pokemon defends a gym controlled by your team, you earn free daily PokeCoins for however many gyms your Pokemon are defending. You will keep earning PokeCoins without spending any money until the gym is under your team’s control.

In order to claim the rewarded PokeCoins, go to the top right corner of your ‘shop’ screen where you’ll find a shield. The number that appears on the shield is the number of gym you have Pokemon defending. Just tap on it and claim your PokeCoins. You will receive 10 PokeCoins for each gym you are defending at the time.

Remember, this process can only be done once every 20 hours or so. It is also wise to keep as many Pokemon defending the gyms as possible to earn more coins, so gather up some teammates and raise the gym’s level to make it even stronger.

200,You can't yet. ,http://comicbook.com/2016/07/17/how-to-get-legendary-pokemon-in-pokemon-go/,"Last week, ComicBook.com gave Pokemon Go players their first glimpse of the Legendary Bird trio and Mewtwo, via a datamine that revealed their Pokedex pictures. Yesterday, a Redditor posted code data from Pokemon Go on the subreddit /r/pokemongodev that revealed some new information about the Legendary Pokemon Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres and Mewtwo.

So how do you catch Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Go? Here's what we know. Based on the information, the four will not appear in the wild. All of their data is missing a ""Base Capture Rate"", which indicates that they can't be caught in the wild. That's a pretty good indicator that all four Pokemon (plus Mew) are being reserved for special events or prizes of some kind.

So if you can't catch Mewtwo and the other Legendary Pokemon in the wild, how do you get them? Well, the popular theory is that they're being saved for ""raids"", a timed event in which players team up to take down a particularly strong Pokemon. We saw a glimpse of that in the first trailer for Pokemon Go, but Niantic has been tight-lipped on the subject since.

Some players are also speculating that the Legendaries could be reserved as some sort of reward for holding a gym or being a top ranked player on your team. Of course, Pokemon Go doesn't currently have a ranking system or way to track how long you've held a gym, so those theories seem more like fanciful speculation than hard fact.

What we do know is that Niantic Labs is hosting a Pokemon Go panel at SDCC next week. With a worldwide rollout underway, it's certainly possible we'll get more details on how and when the Legendary Pokemon will be revealed.",How to Get Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Go,2016-07-19 21:58:26

Like Dogs? Live in Indiana? Then get in touch with Muncie Animal Shelter because they want you to take their dogs for a walk while you’re out capturing Meowths and Rattatas.

“Trying to hatch an egg or catch rare Pokemon?” says the ad on the shelter’s Facebook page. “Come on down to the Muncie Animal Shelter to walk one of our dogs while you get your steps in! Just come to the front desk and say you are here for the Pokemon dogs!”

Phil Peckinpaugh, director of the shelter, said he got the idea after noticing people hunting Pokémon all over the city, so he joined forces with Sam Wiser, an intern at the mayor’s office, and together they came up with the ad that’s since been shared almost 25k times.

202,"Like most plug and play systems, you can't add more games.",http://www.techinsider.io/heres-the-biggest-limitation-of-the-nes-classic-edition-2016-7,"When the news broke earlier this week that Nintendo would be releasing a new, smaller version of its first major game console, the internet was abuzz with nostalgic excitement. The NES Classic Edition will come with 30 of the console's greatest games and it fits right in the palm of your hand for $60 this November.

One question that came up after the announcement was whether or not Nintendo will ever release additional classic games for the system. According to an exchange with Kotaku, the answer is a definitive no.

Sorry folks, but that cartridge slot doesn't open. Nintendo

The cartridge slot on the front of the unit doesn't actually open; it's just there for aesthetic appeal. An original Nintendo cartridge would be far too big to fit in there anyway, of course. But still, some thought it might be able to connect to the internet and download additional games, or receive new games via some other kind of physical media.

""The console is a standalone device, so it cannot connect to the internet or any external storage devices,"" Nintendo told Kotaku. ""The game lineup was chosen to provide a diverse mix of popular and recognizable NES games that appeal to a wide variety of players. Everyone should be able to find multiple games to enjoy.""

The NES Classic Edition doesn't support downloadable or physical add-ons because it isn't meant for video game enthusiasts. Nintendo is tapping into a market of older fans who might see the console, fondly remember games like ""Super Mario Bros."" and ""The Legend of Zelda"" and decide to pick it up to relive their childhoods or play the games with their kids.

It's meant to be a hassle-free nostalgia trip, meaning hardcore gamers who expect features like downloadable content should probably steer clear unless they want it as a collector's item. Other classic game companies like Atari have released similar devices in the past for the casual crowd, and judging by the internet's reaction to the NES Classic Edition, Nintendo's is going to be in pretty high demand this holiday season.",Here's the biggest limitation of Nintendo's new $60 console,2016-07-16 21:45:34
203,Nearby Pokemon indicator. Nobody is sure what distance each paw print represents. ,https://fraghero.com/pokemon-go-has-a-feature-that-nobody-knows-how-to-use/,"So, for those who have been living somewhere under a rock in the middle of the Carribean sea, Pokemon Go came out last week and lots of people are playing it. It’s been a huge hit, and people all over the world are currently enjoying catching Pokemon out in the real world.

The game isn’t overly complex, but then again, neither are its functions explained in great detail. One function in particular has been niggling at players, causing quite a great deal of annoyance. Problem is, it’s one of the games most used features to boot.

The “Nearby” function is theoretically supposed to show you the variety of Pokemon in the area that you’re in, and your distance from each of them. Unless previously caught, only the silhouette of the Pokemon is shown (usually easily guessable however). The distance is represented by pawprints – the greater the number, the further away the Pokemon is.

Now, you would think this feature would typically be one of, if the not the most, used while playing the game. The main point of being a Pokemon trainer is to “catch ‘em all”, after all. However, the feature developer Niantic have currently supplied players with is pretty……well, shit.

There’s no accurate distance to be figured out of from the pawprints. Some people claim that a single pawprint indicates around 50 metres. Then again, the go-to Pokemon factoid site Serebii says that one pawprint actually indicates 20 metres . In that case, two pawprints is 40 metres, and three represent 60 metres? No. According to Serebii, two pawprints are 100 metres, and three means 1000 metres, or 1 kilometre.

Right. Totally logical.

Even being on right on top of a Pokemon (no pawprints) induces a frantic, random search that involves far more work than it should do. If my phone tells me a Pikachu is so close to me I could smell it Poke-fart, I shouldn’t have to spend 20 minutes climbing on top of bins and scrambling under cars for it to grace me with its presence.

Some people think they have a formula nailed down. Redditor TheColourlessPill came up with a formula (shown in the photo below, kindly done by Redditor DJ Toaster) that they think helps narrow down catching those wily Poke-buggers. It’s quite convoluted, and does require at least University level Geography skills, but for now, it might be the best way we have to track down the more elusive targets on our list.

Now, the game has just released, and with its wild popularity, Niantic probably have their hands full just keeping the servers working (especially with people constantly fluking the GPS system to appear in place they’re not ). They’ve undoubtedly received a lot of feedback that will be getting sifted through now right now in order to improve the game and make it more enjoyable for everyone playing.

My own suggestion would be to add a simple, accurate distance to those pawprints. A directional indicator would be handy – maybe an item on the store could be introduced to show the direction of Pokemon from your location, in tandem with the “Nearby” indicator. Niantic may not want to do that, as it could reduce the challenge of the game significantly.

At the very minimum however, if we could just figure out how far away we are from something, we can much more easily search for it. This would help reduce the marathon inducing hunting parties down to merely being annoyed while finding a Pokemon hiding nearby.

That’s my suggestion, for what it’s worth. As to what Niantic decide to actually do, we’ll probably find out soon enough. They plan to introduce a bi-weekly update schedule, so give it another couple weeks, and we’ll see what kind of tweaks and fixes they’ll have in store.",Pokémon Go Has A Feature That Nobody Knows How To Use,2016-07-14 19:41:22
204,Poke stops and empty gyms. ,https://fraghero.com/we-went-to-area-51-to-play-pokemon-go-and-you-wont-believe-what-we-found/,"With the launch of Pokemon Go, the world was curious to know if any Pokemon were to be found at the infamous Extraterrestrial Highway Area 51, and if so, would there be any Pokestops or Gyms?

Area 51 is one of the most secret and heavily guarded military bases on the planet and home to much alien folklore. The curiosity reached a boiling point, and people demanded answers. Will we find Free Pokemon Cheats and Coins?

Situated in the southern portion of Nevada, the base has long been considered one of the most mysterious U.S. Armed Forces establishments, with rumors suggesting it’s used to store alien lifeforms and build high-tech weaponry to fend off alien attacks. This all depends on the size of your tin foil hat, of course.

The Extraterrestrial Highway is State Route 375 (SR 375) located in south-central Nevada in the United States.

The area did indeed feature Pokemon team hunting grounds and also several gyms and Pokestops. We even found a Pokemon right at the back gate of the military base and several rare Pokemon features in the immediate surrounding area.

We were shocked to find empty gyms. There were two completely empty gyms right outside the back gate of the base in the very small town of Rachel, NV. This town has been featured in movies such as Paul, Independence Day, and many others.

At the time of this writing, Fraghero controls 8 pokemon gyms along the extraterrestrial highway leading up to Area 51 itself. We caught several types of Area 51 Pokemon

Warning: Don’t try to do this, we were extremely careful and didn’t break any rules, not to mention our reporter is an ex-military veteran. We won’t be responsible if you end up being detained or worse.

Here’s what we found along the Extraterrestrial Highway, and all the way to the Back Gate of Area 51:

At the corner before you turn on to the highway there is an Alien Jerky Shop with multiple Pokestops

The sign marking the start of the highway. There is also a gym and a Pokestop located here!

We found this guy at this abandoned gas station:

Just chilling in the middle of nowhere:

You will see all kinds of weird stuff on the highway, and almost each one has a Pokestop:

Once you get close to the main gate of the base, they block all mobile signal, but there was a bit of signal at the back gate, which we’ll cover below.

The road to the main gate of Area 51:

We out here



Located right by the Main gate road:

After the main base gate road, if you drive a few more miles down the road you get to the town of Rachel, NV. This town is home to the world famous Little A’Le’Inn, which has been featured in many movies (Paul, Independence Day, etc.)

Located there were 3 gyms, and 5 Pokestops. To our shock and surprise, the gyms were completely empty.

Little A’Le’Inn you stole our hearts. We stole your gyms.

More empty gyms!

Located around the town are several Pokestops and Pokemon:

Located right by the town of Rachel is back gate road. This road leads to the back gate of Area 51. We were able to have mobile signal for the entire drive all the way up to the actual gate.

Here’s a photo of the south gate: (We would post our own, but it’s illegal to photograph this area):

Here’s a screenshot of our Pokemon Go app at the Back Gate of Area 51: (There’s Pokemon!)

And again at night:

On the drive home, we found a Pikachu nearby, at almost every power plant/station (Pikachus store energy in their red cheeks):

We also found Charmanders at large truck stops/gas stations in the “Diesel” section.

Area 51 definitely has a lot to offer for Pokemon Go Tricks players, but it would be stupid to venture out there without doing some extensive research prior to making a trip. However, someone needed to go there and get answers for the millions of Pokemon players out there with this Pokemon Guide, and Fraghero was happy to volunteer for the arduous task.

206,Women are not worse at games than men. When tested they are just as fast at levelling up. ,http://www.iflscience.com/technology/debunking-one-of-the-biggest-stereotypes-about-women-in-the-gaming-community/,"When girl gamers do well, men will often find ways to discredit the success. 'Gamer' via www.shutterstock.com

Although women now make up almost half of all video game players, the gaming community remains, in some ways, hostile toward women.

For example, the GamerGate controversy, which began in 2014 and involved a harassment campaign against prominent female gamers, journalists and designers, reflected a longstanding undercurrent of misogyny and sexism in the community. In some cases, those who challenged the sexism found themselves threatened with rape or death.

There’s also the long-held stereotype that men are simply better gamers than women. Women gamers are often perceived as incompetent players who aren’t genuinely interested in the games but rather sign up to get attention. If a female gamer does play well, she’s often derided as a hacker – someone who cheats to gain an advantage – because “there is no way a girl can be that good.”

In a recent study, we set out to examine whether men really make better gamers than women and, if so, what drove the gender performance gap. Specifically, we wanted to compare how quickly men and women leveled up in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, which are online worlds where thousands of players develop characters, make friends, join groups, complete quests and slay dragons together.

If men are actually better gamers than women, they should advance to higher levels within the same amount of play time. But if they don’t progress any faster, this finding would help refute one of the most pervasive stereotypes that continue to exist in the gaming community.

Getting to the next level

Our research used anonymous server data from over 10,000 men and women in two MMOs, “EverQuest II” in the United States and “Chevaliers' Romance III” in China. We knew each player’s actual gender through their account registration information.",Debunking One Of The Biggest Stereotypes About Women In The Gaming Community,2016-07-12 13:30:01
207,Ana - a healing sniper. ,https://fraghero.com/new-overwatch-hero-announced-and-its-not-who-you-expected/,"Overwatch fans will be excited to hear that a new hero has just been announced to join the roster and help in the fight for saving the world. For a while now, fans have theorised that the new hero will be called Sombra, but any information further than that has laid out of their grasp.

Well, this new hero isn’t Sombra. Sorry to those who thought it would be. However, don’t be disheartened, as you’re in for a lot of fun. This new hero’s name? Ana. Ana, the kickass heal-sniper.

Ana’s inclusion adds a truly unique set of skills for players to get their hands on. Now, you can hang back away from the heat of the action, but still lend support to those in its midst. You can heal, you can put your enemies to sleep, and also lend traditional fire support as you would as a normal sniper.

Check out the gameplay trailer below for peek at what kind of awesomeness you can expect.

Much like other heroes, Ana comes with a distinct back story to flesh out her character, and it’s a goodie. Turns out she is Pharah’s mother, and was part of a group very similar (if not just an earlier incarnation of) the Overwatch team.

Ana taught Pharah all she knows, which explains why she grew up to be such a badass. She states in her origin video that she didn’t want the same life for Pharah as she’d had, although I’d imagine growing up around a group of heroes would kind of set you on that path regardless.

Ana’s inclusion in the game is a big one, both gameplay and story wise. Looking to the future, it’ll be interesting to see how Ana affects the game’s balance, and just who, or what, else Blizzard has up their sleeve. Maybe Sombra will make an appearance in a future release? Maybe Sombra was just a complete ruse? Only time will tell.",New Overwatch Hero Announced And It’s Not Who You Expected,2016-07-12 13:00:03
208,It looks like it gives full access to your entire google account (more info in comments). ,http://www.thefederalistpapers.org/us/people-are-deleting-pokemon-go-asap-after-finding-out-disturbing-fact,"A new Pokemon phone game was released and has taken over social media in the last few days, a sequel of sorts to a video game that was popular in the 1990s.

The new game is called Pokemon Go. The basic concept of the game is walking around capturing Pokemon.

However, the app’s users are unknowingly compromising all their personal information (including pictures) in their Google account. This includes information from prior to the time the app was downloaded.

According to Popular Science:

While Pokémon GO users (there are millions and millions of them already) are collecting all 150 of the game’s fictional species of creatures, Niantic and Nintendo are gaining access to and collecting a lot of your personal information. It’s not just the ability to track your location, or the fact that the app is linked with your Google account that’s worrisome; most users accepted a level of invasive monitoring willingly, given the game is about GPS-based hunting. But the app gives away way more than that to the company. Way more. Anyone who signed up for Pokémon GO with a Google account (the other option, a Pokémon.com account, is unavailable right now) has perhaps unknowingly given Nintendo and developer Niantic (formerly owned by Google, but still part of Google’s investment portfolio) full account access. That means they can see/edit/collect just about anything related to your Google account. Emails, photos, documents, all of your past location and search history: it can see all of this stuff, from even before you started using the app. It can also send emails as you—kind of the number one, red flag, alarm bell hacker opportunity in the digital world, aside from banking.

Apparently users have decided that their privacy isn’t worth the pleasure of chasing Pokemon around their neighborhood. Good choice, America.

Darwin Police Station has warned the players of Pokemon GO to not trespass.

The much awaited mobile phone game, which released this week has received a warm response from the fans. Pokemon GO uses the camera and the GPS of the smartphone to track down real world Pokemon, but the players must make sure that they keep away from visiting some places while catching them.

The media team of the Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services Organization has already already made a made a Facebook post regarding this. The post advises the Pokemon GO players to not enter the Darwin Police Station while collecting Pokeballs.

The post reads, “For those budding Pokemon Trainers out there using Pokemon Go – whilst the Darwin Police Station may feature as a Pokestop, please be advised that you don’t actually have to step inside in order to gain the pokeballs,” the post reads. “It’s also a good idea to look up, away from your phone and both ways before crossing the street.

The much anticipated mobile game Pokémon GO has already released in Australia and New Zealand. The game is definitely a good one to play, but one thing that has troubled the players is its battery consumption.

The game has been accused of draining a whole lot of phone battery. The main reason of the game’s enormous battery consumption, according to CyberShack, is its use of GPS and the rear facing camera.

Developer Niantic, however, stated in the game’s official page that the battery issue is known to them. They wrote:

Heavy battery use Some devices may experience battery drain while playing Pokémon GOfor prolonged periods of time. We are working on a solution.

Some tips to conserve the battery life while using the game is by adjusting screen brightness, reducing in-game actions, and turning off the sound. This has also been mentioned in the Pokémon Go Database. A battery saver option is also available in the game’s settings, but players say that it doesn’t make a noticeable difference.

Here are some tweets from players about the battery life of the game:

For most people, we always save before we exit the game. The use for this feature becomes immediately apparant when you consider Survival Mode however.

You see, before this update, Survival Mode players had to physically walk (no fast travel) to a location that had a bed in order to save. It was extremely inconvenient from a practical sense.

Now with update 1.6, Fallout 4 will create an auto-save upon exiting to the main menu. The save is then deleted once reloading it, in order to prevent people from abusing it in Survival Mode.

It makes it so you still can’t revert back to it if you die, meaning when you reload, you best be on your way to a bed in order to create a perma-save. The change comes as a perfect compromise.

Battlefield 1 has been one of the most hyped games this year and there has been a lot of rumors and leaks about it since its reveal. Recently, a lot of details about the game including maps, modes, weapons and more were leaked. The list of the details were compiled by Reddit user Lobix300.

Just after two days of the massive leak, another rumor involving Battlefield 1 has been been doing rounds. Although, it sounds a bit weird, we are forced to believe that the game might have a ‘capture the pigeon’ mode.

You might definitely be wondering why this rumor is trustworthy or what has capturing pigeons to do with Battlefield 1. We have to partially trust this rumor because it was leaked by YouTube user AlmightyDaq who also posted a video back in March revealing a lot of details about the next Battlefield game which were proved to be true.

AlmightyDaq even explained about the ‘Pigeon game mode’, “There’s also a pigeon game mode. That is to say it’s similar to Capture the Flag in a way. [The] Pigeon functions like a flag that must be held for a certain amount of time before [it] flies away towards the base carrying a message, thus scoring your team a point,” he explains. “It’s pretty ridiculous sounding, but take my word for it.”

Even though it sounds crazy, it is definitely not impossible. However, we’ll have to wait for some time to get this rumor confirmed. Would you love to secure a pigeon in Battlefield 1 for the longest time and score points? We sure would!

The new Play Anywhere feature of Xbox One will be live starting September 13. The release date of the feature, which was announced during last month’s E3 conference, was confirmed by Microsoft to Polygon.

The Play Anywhere feature will allow players to get a PC version of a game for free if they buy its digital copy on Xbox One, and vice versa. The feature also lets the players save their game and achievements across both devices.

However, the upcoming feature will need the Windows 10 Anniversary update which will roll out on August 2. It’s another summer update, which will come out soon, and will also be required for Xbox One users.

ReCore will be the first game to support the Play Anywhere feature, which will release on September 13 alongside the feature itself. Some of the other upcoming games which will support these features are Gears of War 4, Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 3, Scalebound, State of Decay 2, and Halo Wars 2.

Sony, on the other hand said that they had no plans right now to introduce similar kind of features to unite PlayStation 4 and PC.

Andrew House, President of PlayStation said, “I always hesitate to be drawn into discussions of someone else’s strategy. I’m more than happy to talk about our own strategy. Yes, there was a big emphasis from the folks at Microsoft on Xbox and PC cross-play. It remains to be seen whether there is latent large consumer demand for that.”

However, this isn’t the bad news we’re talking about. Pete Hines, Bethesda’s Vice President confirmed something a bit more harrowing during one of his usual Twitter QnA sessions recently that might not go down too well with fans.

The upcoming remastered version of the bestselling Bethesda RPG which is titled as The Elder Scrolls Skyrim: Special Edition, will not support the older save files in present gen consoles.

Pete Hines, Vice President of Bethesda, confirmed while answering to fan’s question on Twitter that cross platform transfer of saved files will not be possible for the remastered version of the game.

One of the fans also inquired whether the saved files can be transferred from PC to Xbox One via the official Bethesda website, to which Hines replied with a straight ‘No’.



Although this news might be disappointing for players who have spent hundreds of hours playing Skyrim, we have to understand the fact that the current gen consoles (Xbox One and PlayStation 4) and the previous gen consoles (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3) have entirely different data structures which makes it impossible to transfer saved files.

215,They are working on GTA Online. It makes them more money. ,https://fraghero.com/this-is-the-reason-why-gta-v-hasnt-had-a-single-player-dlc-yet/,"Grand Theft Auto V has been out for a good few years now but Rockstar is yet to release any single-player DLC for it. This has many gamers thinking as to why there hasn’t been any DLC content released for the game although it was such a massive commercial and critical success.

We finally might have an answer to this question thanks to the recently concluded earnings conference call by Take-Two Interactive for Q3 2015.

According to Take-Two their net revenue for Q3 was $486.8 million as compared to $954 million in last year’s third quarter. The dip in earnings is mostly due to no notable releases from its stables during this time period while last year had quite a few of them.

However, that’s still a large amount of money and most of it is due to one title: Grand Theft Auto V. You might be wondering how that’s possible but it’s obvious.

This is due to Grand Theft Auto Online which is the standalone online component of the game. The online product seems to be raking in serious moolah for Take-Two and it’s no surprise that there’s been no single-player DLC pack release for GTA V.

Rockstar is busy adding more features to the online experience and releasing DLC for GTA Online regularly and has had no time to focus on GTA V’s single-player aspects.

Rockstar is fully committed to improving the experience for gamers and has been known to release several additions to improve the product.

This has prevented them from focusing on the single-player game and considering how successful GTA Online has proven to be, it is likely there won’t ever be a single-player DLC pack for GTA V.

Take-Two’s promised even more content for GTA Online in days to come which will further boost revenue. When there is money being made, who cares about keeping up old promises such as releasing an expansion pack for the single-player aspect of GTA V?

Take-Two clearly doesn’t but don’t write them off completely. We might have an announcement during E3 this year that might prove us wrong (we hope).",The real reason GTA V hasn’t got any single player DLC ever,2016-07-01 13:00:06

Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg has spoken about the company’s reaction to the initial fan response to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, in an interview with Mashable.

The official reveal trailer of the game has garnered over more than 3 million dislikes on YouTube since it was uploaded on May 2nd.

In the interview with Mashable at E3, Eric Hirshberg confirmed that the company hasn’t changed anything in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare after the initial fan response, which was overwhelmingly negative, especially on YouTube.

He said, “We’re doing the same thing after the response as before, which is focusing on making a great game.” “At the end of the day, when we do that we tend to make fans happy and win people over and continue to have the franchise flourish,” he added.

Hirshberg also mentioned the fact that even Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 received negative responses initially but went on to become the best selling Call of Duty game ever. Black Ops 2 was also disregarded by fans before release because of the futuristic setting of the game.

“Our previous most-disliked trailer was the reveal trailer for Black Ops 2,” Hirshberg said. “[That was] the first time we brought the franchise into the future. And that turned out to be one of our most successful games ever.”

Hirshberg said, “The franchise has never been stronger than it is right now in terms of the number of people we have online playing. Black Ops 3 is doing great. We’ve managed to keep it relevant and fresh longer than many people thought we could.”

The CEO also stressed on the fact that the dislikes on YouTube didn’t affect the pre-order numbers of the game. Interestingly, he pointed out that the negative reactions were mostly restricted to YouTube, and the trailer for the game was mostly well received on other social media platforms, including Facebook.

He said, “We didn’t see that reaction on other platforms and in other metrics.We didn’t see it in our pre-order momentum, we didn’t see it even in the same exact [trailer posting] on other platforms, like Facebook.” “It was unique.”

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare managed to impress with its E3 presentation, where it showed off some amazing single-player gameplay footage. However, there’s been a total blackout as far as the game’s multiplayer is concerned, but the company’s expected to showcase it during its upcoming Call of Duty XP event in September.",Activision CEO sends out clear message when asked if Infinite Warfare changed after negative fan response,2016-06-30 07:39:17

Speaking of searching, here’s all the Fallout news of last week, in case you missed any!

As seen below, the trash can will completely block all damage. Toss a grenade under one and you’ll be totally safe. That’s very important considering the next part of this involves using the trash can as.. well.. a mine cannon!

Yeah, yeah, it sounds ridiculous, but not much is cooler than killing ghouls, mutants, deathclaws, or whatever really, only using some mines and a trash can, and a player has actually posted a video showing him carrying out this insane feat.

You can watch the video below.

It’s rather incredible really, considering he’s charging a Behemoth at one point with a trash can..

So I know you’re just dying to hop on Fallout 4 and give this a go. A little advice.. we don’t suggest you try this on Survival Mode, as you yourself are somewhat of a glass cannon.

219,Absolutely nothing. This is a satire article from FragHero. ,https://fraghero.com/you-wouldnt-believe-what-rockstar-announced-for-gta-vi/,"Since the popular release of GTA V in September 2013, fans of Rockstar Games have been kept in the dark about the details of the next installment of the series.

Related Video: GTA VI: Six Things That Will Make It The Best Game Ever

Many fans have speculated that GTA V would be the last installment due to the ambiguously named “GTA Online” – a name which implies that future installments, at least of a multiplayer variety, are not to be expected.

However, new information from a multitude of sources has been leaked about the next installment in Rockstar Games’ headlining series, including specifics about the game’s setting, plot, features and functionality. As with any pre-release information, this is subject to interpretation and change.

Though no release date has been confirmed, GTA 6 has been confirmed to release sometime in the future. The exact date will likely be two years ahead of the initial estimated release date set by Rockstar, to give them time to “polish” the final copy and deliver an experience fans are sure to enjoy, despite their discontent while waiting twenty-four months more than they should have.

More details have also leaked, read on to know how Rockstar Games plans to make GTA VI the best game the universe has ever seen. (No, really)

GTA 6 will feature a main character – or characters – that players will be forced to control if they wish to play the game. These lead characters will be voiced by an actor, or actors, who will have exponentially more witty dialogue and banter than any of the side characters or miscellaneous pedestrians because they’re just naturally more intelligent, funny, and bulletproof.

The graphics are rumored to be an improvement on those of GTA V, and the physics engine and AI functionality will also be improved to prevent drivers who accidentally run over player characters from reversing and running them over six more times.

Though unconfirmed, there are also reports that large vehicles capable of towing will also no longer take off like the Apollo 13 rocket when attached to a trailer and touched by anything more forceful than a hummingbird.

Much to the disappointment of many players, the game will not be released on PS1 or the Nintendo 64. This has led to uproar among fans who insist their older consoles are “just as good” as next-gen platforms and they shouldn’t lose out on content just because they don’t have access to their parents’ money or the motivation to get a job and buy a newer system.

Though a multiplayer aspect has been rumored, players will require an online connection in order to access it. The stability of the online mode has been put up for debate, however, as almost all online features will also require a connection to Rockstar’s servers which are known to go down faster and more frequently than a cheerleader on prom night.

Some of the game’s shops will have humorous names such as “All Of My Stock is Legal” or “Totally Legitimate Medicinal Marijuana Dispensary.” This has already incited anger among Liberal media and social justice activists for being offensive and an unfair representation of multiple minorities as well as the entirety of the country.

The game will feature a radio with multiple stations, many of which play various kinds of music. Some will also feature talk radio shows, which will undoubtedly annoy every side character, prostitute and ally who enters your vehicle to the point of suicide.

Despite fan conspiracy theories, the game is confirmed to be set on the planet Earth and will not feature laser guns, hybrid jetpacks, alien invasions, or any other galactic planetary entity as a playable area.

Finally, the game will feature mature content, such as receiving fully-clothed sexual acts from sentient plastic dolls, senselessly murdering obese Midwestern tourists for yelling obscenities at you, and partial nudity which will undoubtedly be repeatedly photographed and uploaded to Rockstar’s Social Club by twelve-year-old children obsessing over an animated nipple, or worse, a seventy-year-old altruist’s kibbles and bits.

In addition to these features, Rockstar is said to have multiple downloadable content bundles in the works, which will be free to download but contain items so ludicrously expensive in game currency that microtransactions will be necessary to own anything more than your grandmother’s Buick and an airsoft pistol.

Those drizzles are about to turn into a flood.

This morning, Blizzard Entertainment announced that it will implement Facebook Live API, allowing players to log in to Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo III, StarCraft II, and the newest sensation Overwatch and live-stream sessions onto their timelines later this month via PC. No definite start date was announced, though.

The new features will allow friends to subscribe to other player’s timelines, notifying them when a new stream has begun. Presumably, as with Facebook’s current live streaming video functionality, friends and subscribers can comment and share while tuned in to the stream.

“Blizzard games are best when played with friends, so it’s important to us to provide our players with features and services that make it easy and fun to share their experiences with each other,” said Blizzard executive vice president of corporate operations Gio Hunt. “We’re working closely with Facebook on this integration for Overwatch, as well as our other games, and we look forward to sharing further details on our plans as development progresses.”

This new development was almost inevitable, given the popularity of Facebook video and game streaming on platforms like Twitch. Blizzard started streaming on Facebook this year with “Heroes of the Dorm,” the collegiate Heroes of the Storm tournament that aired on ESPN 2 last year. At the launch of Overwatch last week, which Elon Musk is a fan for whatever that’s worth, Blizzard live-streamed the event for its 3 million fans.

The unity between Facebook and Blizzard wasn’t overnight. To prep for Overwatch’s launch, Facebook and Blizzard worked on a “comprehensive mix” of marketing solutions using Facebook’s targeting capabilities. This helped expose Overwatch to 1.65 billion people, which explains why everyone is obsessed about it and you’re a loser if you’re not playing it.

They replied with the names of the following countries when fans asked which nations will be included in the multiplayer version of the game. It looks like you can play as the following: British, German, Austro-Hungarian, Italian, Ottoman, and American.

It was confirmed that France and Russia, who played major roles in World War 1, will not feature in the game, at least in the launch build of the game. This has left the fans wondering why these two nations were omitted at launch.

This comes as quite a surprising decision on DICE’s part, considering both France and Russia played an important role in World War 1 and lost more than a million soldiers each who served on the frontlines.

However, it was revealed later that the French will be included in the multiplayer through a DLC pack. Julien Wera of DICE, in an interview with Lemonde, said that they acknowledged the importance of France’s contribution to World War 1, and hence decided to include French troops as a dedicated DLC post launch. Wera didn’t mention whether the DLC will be a paid or a free one.

223,Jump. ,http://time.com/4365659/zelda-breath-of-the-wild/,"After three decades of acrobatically restrained Zelda games, Nintendo is about to upend a sacred franchise tenet: Link, the series’ elf-eared, avocado-trousered protagonist, can finally jump. Not the little leap he’ll perform automatically in older installments when you run him off a ledge, but a button-specific, bona fide vault.

There’s a justifiable game-changing reason for this, and it involves serious hang-time in what Nintendo’s dubbed The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. That’s the official name for the next-in-series fantasy roamer, due simultaneously on the company’s Wii U and forthcoming new game platform (still known solely as “NX”) next March. I’ll explain the game’s title in a moment.

But first let’s talk about climbing. Serious climbing. Rock climbing. Tree climbing. Whatever-you-can-touch-climbing. Approach any perpendicular surface, tap the jump button, and up Link goes. Ruins. Vertiginous towers. Cliff walls. Tree trunks. Escarpments you’d slide down in any other game or need a grappling hook to summit. Altaïr, Spiderman and this guy have nothing on the newfangled version of Nintendo’s iconic sword-spinner. It’s all part of the creative team’s attempt to craft an open-ended world for players to tramp through any way they like in another first for the series.

Or maybe a second, if we’re counting Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka’s 1986 Nintendo Entertainment System free-wandering original. As in that game, you can venture into Breath of the Wild‘s more than 100 dungeons (called “shrines”) in whatever order you like. Just don’t expect the enemies lying in wait to be homogenous pushovers. That’s part of how Nintendo’s regulating progression through the game this time: With great freedom comes the likelihood that you’ll wander into a growling goblin’s nest.

Nintendo

On the other hand, Nintendo says it hopes you’ll do just that, which is where the subtitle “Breath of the Wild” comes in. At a pre-E3 event, the game’s producer Eiji Aonuma explained that instead of coming up with a title based on a central story item (ocarinas, swords, caps, hourglasses) or character (Link, Majora, the eponymous twilight princess), the team wanted it to emblematize the world itself. So “wild” in the sense that Nintendo wants experimentation and surprise by way of the open, unexplored world design to be “the soul of the experience.”

That carries through the game’s visual style, inspired by a form of water color art called gouache, said Nintendo. It’s further informed by an approach to painting known as en plein air, or “open air,” where the artist attempts to replicate the moment of an experience (to give that a bit of context, impressionists like Monet and Renoir were proponents of the approach). In practice, it’s something like a hybridization of the look in the last few games, as if The Wind Waker‘s cel-shading were merged with Twilight Princess‘s quasi-realistic style.

The world, which I was able to dash and scramble around for roughly 30 minutes, feels as grand as teased in earlier sneak peeks, and the team says wherever you can see you can go “and beyond.” In the demo, we were allowed to explore a partly forested area Nintendo said represented just 1% of the total explorable world. Zoom the map out, and that world becomes a sprawl of regions grouped into valleys, jungles, mountains and—Treehouse’s Bill Trinen teased this last—possibly even the ocean. All told, Nintendo says Breath of the Wild is 12 times the size of Twilight Princess (itself no slouch in the epic fantasy world Olympics).

Jumping and free-roaming are just the start of the game’s rethinking of cherished Zelda tropes. Instead of cutting grass to conjure life-replenishing hearts, you hunt for or harvest ingredients consumable raw for minor performance boosts. Combine these in a cooking pan, by contrast, and you can craft edibles with perks in what looks to be an elaborate recipe chasing mini-game.

The weather plays a role now, too. Sudden downpours can douse fires, and brandishing a metallic object during a lightning storm may have the sort of jolting repercussions you’d imagine. There’s even a temperature gauge you’ll need to keep tabs on, donning warmer clothes to survive colder environments and vice versa.

Nintendo

Link’s arsenal of axes, clubs and long blades are more transient and break easily, and part of maintaining your arsenal involves stealing new ones from enemies. Enemies no longer roam at random, but occupy colonies and encampments, and they’re meant to have a sense of situational purposefulness, says Nintendo. Wait until nighttime (1 minute of realtime = 1 hour of game time) and they’ll sleep, making them easier to sneak up on, and sneaking’s also a thing: Move quickly and an audio meter bounces erratically to indicate your conspicuousness; crouch, and the meter flattens to let you know you’ve become sonically invisible.

A new and apparently intricate physics framework empowers distinctive tactics. Chop down a hillside tree (yes, Link can chop down trees) and it’ll topple, then roll downhill, clearing whatever’s in its path (or, if near a crevasse, become a bridge you can clamber across). The same for boulders, which you can shove down inclines to flatten foes. The series’ spherical bombs now come in multiple flavors, including one you can ply the environment to roll or push around like a pinball. Hop on Link’s shield and he’ll surf, Legolas-like, down mountainsides. And there’s a paraglider with which Link can soar high above areas, taking in the view to spy hidden items or suss alternate approach paths.

What’s to stop players from immediately ranging across half the map with impunity? Climb or fly without pause and a circular stamina meter gradually dwindles until Link plummets. I take that to mean there’ll be plenty of climbing and flying puzzles, where you’ll have to plot approach paths by locating and folding respite points into lengthy climbs or glides. (That, or come up with recipes for stamina-bolstering victuals.)

As promised, you can use the Wolf Link amiibo to import that character as a companion who’ll stay with Link until defeated (at which point you have to wait 24 hours of real world time to re-import him). Level up Wolf Link’s health playing Twilight Princess, and he’ll have the same number of hearts playing at Link’s side in Breath of the Wild; import him cold, and he’ll be stuck with just three (a clear prod to Wii U fans who’ve yet to buy that game bundle). Nintendo’s also making two new amiibo, one of Link holding a bow (Archer Link) and another of him on horseback (Rider Link), but the team wasn’t ready to say how they’ll function in the game.

Nintendo

It’s not clear what Link’s up to or who he’s ultimately squaring off with in the Zelda-verse this time, but Aonuma confirmed this version of Link has been snoozing for 100 years (he wakes and rises from a tomb-like bed at the game’s start). And when someone asked where this Zelda slots in the lore, Aonuma pointed to the t-shirt he came wearing, inscribed with a variation on the Sheikah eye symbol that’s appeared in Zelda games since Ocarina of Time. Make of that what you will, said Aonuma with a sly smile.

Towards the end of my demo, in the belly of a rune-scrawled shrine, I got my hands on one of the game’s most intriguing new items: A magnet that lets you seize and then wing large objects around. All I managed to do before the demo ended was to yank a panel off the floor (unearthing a passage) and levitate a large block (to clear my route, but it also looked like I might be able to lob it at enemies). But my sense was that it’ll be a central part of this philosophical shift to a “single puzzle, multiple solutions” motif.

Important questions remain, the most obvious being how players are going to be able to have the same experience on the Wii U and NX versions—a point confirmed by Aonuma during the presentation—if the NX is truly something “unique and different.” We’ll know soon enough, when the company unveils the Wii U’s successor later this year.

It also announced a brand new Quake game during the press conference.

Despite all this, one thing that the fans missed during the press conference was the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6.

Most of the fans expected the game to be announced during the event owing to the fact that Skyrim protagonist Dragonborn’s image was featured in Bethesda’s E3 promo images.

However, even though the game was not announced during the event, Bethesda boss Todd Howard confirmed that the game is in works in his own special way.

Speaking to Geoff Keighley during a “Youtube Live at E3” interview, Howard let the cat out of the bag:

It’s good in these moments to tell our fans, ‘Yes, of course we are [making The Elder Scrolls 6]. It’s something we love.’ But it is–you know, I have to be careful what I say–it’s a very long way off.” He added, “I could sit here and explain the game to you, and you would say, ‘That sounds like you don’t even have the technology–how long is that going to take?”

Howard also said they are working on two more projects which will be revealed before The Elder Scrolls 6, which means the latter won’t be coming anytime soon.

Vice President of PR and Marketing at Bethesda, Pete Hines, tweeted that he jokes with Todd Howard The Elder Scrolls 6 will release on 22/22/22. He also added that “our robot overlords will change our calendar system by the time it comes out.”

Although this is not a good news for the fans of the franchise, they’ll still have some other Elder Scrolls content to indulge in. Bethesda announced that there is going to be a big update in The Elder Scrolls Online and The Elder Scrolls: Legends will be releasing in PC and mobile.

225,Their core audience are males according to a former coder's Twitter. ,https://fraghero.com/battlefield-1-wont-have-female-soldiers-in-multiplayer-because-of-this-outrageous-reason/,"With Battlefield 1 producing groundbreaking features and currently living up to its hype, there is still one thing that each Battlefield game has been lacking: female soldiers in multiplayer. And it doesn’t look like EA’s next installment will entertain that idea, either.

With popular shooters such as Call of Duty and Overwatch including female characters in their multiplayer formats, it’s become quite the norm to play as a woman with guns blazing. However, the Battlefield franchise has never provided this feature, and Battlefield 1 will be no different. (Note that this is regards to online multiplayer only, because there is a playable female character in the story mode.)

What’s really entertaining is the reason behind this decision. Originally, females were going to be integrated as playable multiplayer characters, but then the idea was scrapped due to boys not finding it believable. Former DICE coder, Amanda Coget, took to Twitter in order to discuss how the conversation went down.

Even though female soldiers in WWI was not a common thing, it happened. And even though Battlefield is more realistic with its play style in comparison to other shooters, it’s still a video game.

There is a ton of room for interpretation when it comes to developing battles and fighting because despite how realistic a game is, it’s still pretty fictional. (I mean come on, respawning multiple times in a match is realistic, but playing as a female soldier isn’t?)

I’ve never classified myself as a feminist by any means, but this is ridiculous. It’s not upsetting that Battlefield 1 won’t have female soldiers (in multiplayer), but it’s highly offensive that they are catering to boys that wouldn’t find the idea believable. The concept is understandable, but the reasoning is not.

This isn’t the first time the game attempted to accommodate to the less informed consumer. EA originally ditched the idea of a World War I setting because they were concerned that kids didn’t know that it actually happened.

226,Perma-ban ,https://fraghero.com/bad-news-for-the-division-cheaters-as-ubisoft-finally-announces-harsh-punishment-for-offenders/,"The team that made The Division have had enough and decided that it’s one strike and you’re out. From an announcement made on the official Division website , the team stated that even first time offenders would be perma-banned if caught cheating in the game.

The announcement starts by acknowledging the effect cheating has had on the gamer base:

“Cheating has been a source of frustration for our community as some individuals have been gaining an unfair advantage in the game by using third-party software at the expense of our loyal players”

The rest of the announcement delves a little further into how exactly this cheating has been occurring, information coming from a podcast they released earlier on the matter. They state:

“While some of the game decisions are made client-side, there are constant server checks in place. This ensures that even in the situation where a player would be able to modify his client data, the servers can detect it.”

It’s from the client-server disparities that allow the cheaters to cheat. As good as the server checks are, things can still slip past. When The Division was initially released, lots of things could circumvent the server checks and gamers were free to abuse these as they saw fit.

Now though, the checks are much more in-depth and secure, and it’s becoming harder and harder for players to cheat in the game without getting noticed. With this new, iron-fist approach to even first time offenders, cheating could very soon become a thing of the past entirely.

This is all well and good. However, due to the extreme amount of negative responses The Division has accumulated since release, there may not be much of a player base to cheat soon anyways. The game is haemorrhaging players on PC, according to data provided by Steam itself. The peak number of gamers playing at one time in June so far is a little over 16,000. Compare that back closer to when the game launched in March, and a peak of 114,000 players can be seen.

That is a phenomenal loss of players in that space of time. Three months and 100,000 players lave the game? Ouch. If that kind of trend continues, no one will be playing The Division at all come the end of the year.

So, it’s a good thing that The Division is becoming more regulated and less cheatable, but it might be too little too late to save it from its possibly inevitable doom. It’s very possible that the game might see a resurgence in popularity, but usually once a game has lost steam, there’s little else you can do but stoke the fire and pray for the best.

Time will tell what lies in store for the future of The Division, and what kind of legacy its tumultuous release will leave on the industry.",Bad news for The Division cheaters as Ubisoft finally announce harsh punishment for offenders,2016-06-11 01:29:56

228,Micro Transactions and map packs. ,https://fraghero.com/ea-just-confirmed-two-of-the-most-hated-features-for-battlefield-1/,"Battlefield 1’s official trailer has been getting rave reviews both from the gaming community and industry experts in general. Not only have the reveal trailer become the most viewed trailer on Youtube, but it also crushed its competitor Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare’s trailer, both in terms of reception and amount of views.

However, one should not forget that the Battlefield franchise is being published by EA, who isn’t really a fan-favorite either. And now, the company has sneakily confirmed that both micro-transactions and map packs would be part of Battlefield 1.

This information was revealed by EA’s CEO Andrew Wilson during a investor call last week. Although Wilson used some rather generous marketing speak to confirm the same, it doesn’t help taking away from the fact that most gamers despise this model.

Also read: Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare trailer is now the second most hated video on Youtube

Wilson first said how EA plans to make big bucks by cleverly utilizing ‘extra monetization opportunities’ without making the game feel like a ‘pay-to-win’ model:

As relates to Battlefield 1 and extra monetization opportunity,” CEO Andrew Wilson says, “taking a step back, any time we think about extra monetization inside an experience, we really think about it on two vectors: One, are we able to provide value to the gamer, in terms of extending and enhancing their experience? And two, are we able to do that in a world where we give them choice? We never want to be in a place where there’s a belief that we are providing a pay to win mechanic inside of one of our games.

He then went on to say how the company is looking poised to utilize both macro transactions and micro transactions in Battlefield 1 to offer a more ‘enhanced’ experience to players. Basically, fancy words for map packs (macro) and in-game items unlocked by paying real cash (micro).

Given that in Battlefield 1, you will see both macro monetization opportunities from us like maps and large scale content, as well as micro monetization opportunities, smaller increments of gameplay, and then over time, what you will see from us is elements of gameplay that allow gamers to engage and drive, and extend and enhance their experience, much the way people do with FIFA Ultimate Team or Madden Ultimate Team today. We feel very confident in our ability to deliver that in a way that is deemed valuable by our player, and drives increased engagement over time with them.

It’s a given that there’s big money to be made via in-game transactions these days and EA’s own sports games make a fortune by implementing them. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 has taken it to the extremes via its paid supply drops model. Heck, GTA Online’s made over $500 million via micro transactions alone.

Therefore, this shouldn’t surprise anyone but still it makes one wonder how serious the developers are about shipping a full game at launch these days compared to releasing it in bits and pieces to boost revenue.",These Two Hated Features are part of Battlefield 1,2016-06-09 05:45:41

Telltale Games’ head of creative communication, Job Stauffer, has detailed the release window for their upcoming titles Batman and The Walking Dead, Season 3 via Twitter.

Although the exact release dates are yet to be announced, Stauffer tweeted that the Batman series will be launched in this summer and the third season of The Walking Dead will release in the fall this year. His reference to E3 2016 in the tweet with a wink suggests that more details could be uncovered soon.

Telltale CEO Kevin Bruner, in an SXSW event a couple of months ago, said that the players will need to play as both Batman and Bruce Wayne in the later half of the game. However, at the start the players will have an option to chose who they want to play as between the two characters.

It was also discussed earlier that the Batman game will feature some familiar characters like Vicki Vale, Jim Gordon, Alfred Pennyworth and Renee Montoya. The developers also confirmed that the game will have more than one villain, although they aren’t being confirmed yet. The story, however, will not be related to any of the previous version any Batman game.

All Points Bulletin has made its console debut yesterday after being quietly launched on Xbox One. The new game, APB: Reloaded is inspired by GTA and will continue to be a free-to-play MMOTPS as its predecessor.

APB, developed by Grand Theft Auto creator David Jones and Realtime Worlds, made its first entry on PC in 2010 as a subscription based MMO. The original idea was to make the game GTA’s MMO version, but it failed to materialize due to some issues.

The game was then forced to be sold off and released as APB: Reloaded in 2011. However, the latest console version of the game is developed by Reloaded Games and published by Ravenscourt.

APB: Reloaded on Xbox One will remain the same as the PC version. The free to play game will offer the players various vehicles, weapons, customization options and open-world combat for a maximum of 100 players. The players will also get a chance to be either a criminal or a law enforcer in the game.

The game supports micro transactions and is free to download. However, the players will need an Xbox Gold subscription to play the game. The players will have an option to buy the currency used in the game named G1C, which will come in packages ranging from $5 for 400 G1C to $200 for 20,800 G1C.

The developers have also said that the players who play the game before the first patch is released will receive a free Founders Pack, which consists of a vehicle, Fireworks Flare Launcher, etc. To add to this they have also promised free weapon skins and an exclusive in-game title for the players who play more than 10 hours within this period.

Although the release date has not been fixed yet, a PlayStation 4 version of the game is in the works. The blog post of the developers mentions that APB: Reloaded will come to PlayStation 4 after the first patch for Xbox One releases. Initially, both the console versions were scheduled to release in mid 2015.

The blog also mentioned the problems faced by the users of the PC version of the game. They stated:

“As many of you guys are aware, we have been in development limbo (or development hell) for a very long time. The console versions were originally supposed to ship a long time ago and we were contractually obligated to release the new engine on the console version before shipping these changes on PC. Since the new engine performs really well on PC, it has been a bit frustrating to be stuck in this mode for this long.”

They went on to add that the PC version will gain from the fact that the console versions are finally releasing.The full blog post about APB: Reloaded can be read here.","This popular GTA-styled MMO quietly launched on Xbox One, has a $200 DLC pack",2016-06-05 04:15:26
231,"A new melee system, for hand to hand combat. ",https://fraghero.com/battlefield-1-producer-has-teased-a-brutal-new-feature-for-the-game/,"Battlefield 1 got a ton of new information outlined during a interview, one of the game’s multiplayer producers named Andreas Morell, did. The interview teased a lot of cool upcoming reveals including an updated hand-to-hand combat system.

Earlier this week, it was confirmed that Battlefield 1 would be getting its first proper gameplay reveal during E3, where the game’s 64-player multiplayer mode will be shown to the public and press for the first time.

The producer teased some really interesting stuff when speaking to OXM (Official Xbox Magazine), the most interesting of which was a new melee system that the team is adding to the game, especially in the multiplayer portion.

Although he didn’t go into details but he was quick to state that since Battlefield 1 takes place during world war 1, the game is from an era which didn’t have modern day weapons or combat, and hand-to-hand combat among soldiers was almost medieval. This brutal style of melee combat would be portrayed in the game, according to him.

When you look at the kind of all-out war, you have air, land, sea and a big part of the fighting on the actual ground was almost the – if you put yourself in the position of the soldiers back then when they got their state-of- the-art machine guns, but then they can turn the corner and then there is a guy with a big trench mace, it’s almost medieval and it’s that clash of those two worlds that we felt like this is really something that we need to have in the game and it really adds something to it. It’s a brutal side to – brutal and personal side to kind of the combat in Battlefield 1.

He also confirmed that the levolution mechanic that Battlefield 4 introduced and Hardline also utilized, would be making a return with Battlefield 1. The system would also be enhanced and the team was hard at work creating a more ‘dynamic destruction’ experience with the new game. Battleships were also confirmed for the game but he didn’t really confirm whether or not Zeppelins would also be a part of the game.

Expect a lot more to be seen during E3 that’s scheduled for later this month but it seems EA is preparing to drop a whole lot of new information about the game soon and we’re really excited to see it get revealed.",Battlefield 1 producer has teased a brutal new feature for the game,2016-06-04 08:30:21
232,Cheating. ,https://fraghero.com/heres-why-blizzard-is-already-banning-thousands-of-overwatch-players/,"It seems Blizzard isn’t one to go back on its words. Last month it promised that it’ll ban any cheaters or hackers in Overwatch, and there will be no second chances provided.

Fast forward to now, only a few days after the game’s official launch, and it’s already coming good on its promise by banning thousands of Overwatch players.

Anyone using Overwatch cheat programs are being banned by Blizzard, and the company unleashed a massive ban wave yesterday that forced the program’s creators to actually shut down the servers until they figure out how to bypass Blizzard’s security.

That’s not all, however. A PC Gamer report mentions that Blizzard is banning cheaters not only once, but several times. This means if you’ve cheated, buying a new copy might not be enough. Several users are reporting that Blizzard banned them again after they bought a new copy. A few even tried buying a 3rd copy and yet they got banned within 24 hours of playing the game.

Blizzard’s even taken a more brutal stance in China. The company, along with its partner NetEase, has ensured it bans anyone stupid enough to try cheating in the game. It unleashed a massive 1572 person ban wave earlier today. The company went a step ahead as far as savagery is concerned and revealed all the names it had banned due to cheating.

The moral of this story is clear as day, and it’s that you should not even think about cheating while playing Overwatch. No matter how smart you think you are, it’ll only end in one result, and that’s getting banned not once, but possibly forever. And no, using a VPN might not be enough since many users have reported that Blizzard managed to ban them even though they used a VPN.

233,"Not really. Currently it's just (an artists) concept art, importing Liberty City locations to the new engine. ",https://fraghero.com/leaked-screenshot-shows-liberty-city-gta-v-campaign-dlc-way/,"Hold off your horses, but an artist working with Rockstar has revealed a screenshot of an area featured in GTA IV’s Liberty City remade inside GTA V’s gameworld which uses the RAGE engine. The image was found on a portfolio website.

The image was found by two GTA Forums users Spider Vice and BlackScout. The artist, Adrian Page, who’s currently employed by Rockstar Games, had uploaded a bunch of in-engine concept arts to his resume. Interestingly, one of them is the recreated version of Liberty City’s Middle Park location, using the RAGE engine in GTA V’s gameworld.

Adding fuel to the possibility of a single player DLC pack featuring Liberty City in GTA V is that fact that ex-Rockstar North president, Leslie Benzies had confirmed that there was the chance of “one big world containing all our cities [that] let the player fly between them and revisit their favorite areas”.

This was way back in 2012 and there has not been a single campaign DLC pack launched for the game ever. Could Rockstar be secretly working on one without revealing any details?

Take this with a grain of salt due to multiple factors, for starters, this doesn’t confirm that Liberty City is coming to GTA V simply because it can be merely a concept art by the artist with no actual involvement from Rockstar.

This could also be porting work done to test how it looks when made using the RAGE engine. It can also be content that is no longer in development, or just a passion project for the particular artist to make his resume look more interesting.

Keeping the cynicism aside, the possibility of this actually meaning something can’t be ruled out either. Rockstar Games just announced its biggest GTA Online DLC pack ever and the fact that it might be preparing to announce a campaign DLC for GTA V soon isn’t really clutching at straws either. If there are any more updates regarding this, we’ll be the first to let you know.","Leaked: Screenshot Shows Liberty City in GTA V, Campaign DLC On The Way?",2016-06-02 11:38:28
234,Over 92 hours. ,https://fraghero.com/this-overwatch-player-has-already-reached-level-100-heres-how-many-hours-hes-played/,"Overwatch has been out for merely over a week now and the game’s doing really well. Activision Blizzard has pulled off a stunner and the community playing the game grows with every passing day.

The game has also managed to win over the critics and the gaming community has been extremely vocal about how good the game is. Some gamers are playing the game for hours on end and one of them has already managed to reach the coveted level 100 rank in the game.

Twitch streamer FenderellaKN has accomplished this in about 7 days and he made a stream celebrating this achievement earlier this week. The streamer and Overwatch addict has clocked over 92 hours in the game so far and the average streaming session lasts for around 15 hours. Crazy.

He also mentioned that he plays the game for about 13 hours a day on an average. He prefers playing as Pharah, the offensive tactical hero the most, and he has a 51 percent win rate. The guy’s played a total of 727 games (might have increased now) the last time we checked.

Interestingly, Overwatch doesn’t have a level cap however your level is reset to 1 after reaching 100. This means 101 level would show up as 1 but you get a cool new border every time you reach the level 100 rank and also a star under your profile pic. (image above).

During a reddit AMA, the streamer assured that he didn’t game share with anyone else and has reached the prestigious rank all by himself. His streams are a testament to this claim and it’s definitely not an easy feat, considering the game’s just out for little more than a week right now.","This Overwatch Player has Already Reached Level 100, Here’s How Many Hours He’s Played",2016-06-02 05:59:06

Weather conditions and time of day will instead be pre-match options.

""We opted to not have the transitions in the race this time in order to raise the frame rate and the quality of the image during the race,"" he said. ""So the user will be able to set that before they enter the race. So you'll still be able to have night races, morning, races at dawn, dusk and so on.""

237,Sombra. More details in comments. ,https://fraghero.com/overwatch-has-a-secret-character-and-shes-going-to-be-revealed-soon/,"A new character might be on its way for joining the Overwatch roster soon. Cyber detectives and some Overwatch fans are hopeful about this and are keeping a keen eye on the hints provided by Blizzard on their videos. They are also gathering all the information about the new character available on the web and piecing them together.

A story about this was covered in detail by NeoGaf, where they compiled a couple of sources which indicates that the new support character named Sombra can come to Overwatch soon.

To start with, they pointed out to a French theater ad which suggested that Sombra will be unveiled for Overwatch soon. Soon after, the theater where the ad was shown later claimed that the tease in the ad was a typo. However NeoGaf user, Nirolak, who compiled the article believes that the theater is lying as Blizzard had already confirmed about working on two new heroes.

Pointing at the second clue Nirolak wrote, “Way back in November, people noticed that there’s a table in Dorado with files for Soldier 76/Jack Morrison and Sombra. Given Soldier 76 is Jack Morrison, this only leaves the mysterious Sombra file, which would fit with a Soldier 76 vs. Sombra animated short.”

Sombra has also made several appearances in various stages. She wears a metal grey helmet which is highlighted by blue, along with a gray over hood and a blue under hood. The grey and blue combination in her outfit is the main reason she is thought to have ties with Soldier 76 and Reaper.

Nirolak also mentioned about Reaper’s dialogue in the game where he says, “Where is Sombra when you need her?”, which can be another massive hint.

Apart from these, there has also been information that Sombra was seen in the character select screen along with a sniper scope, which is another strong signal that the character might be on its way to Overwatch soon.

There are also speculations that Sombra could well be a villain, who would join the other villains on the game later. Overwatch is already short of villains and this can be a logical speculation, but anything cannot be confirmed until we hear it from Blizzard.

At this point we can certainly say that there’s something or someone called Sombra, which is directly or indirectly related to Overwatch, but it’ll be interesting to find out what Blizzard thinks on this.

Capcom has also published official bios for both characters, though it's in Japanese. Since Street Fighter 5 is set after Street Fighter 2, the characters have been redesigned somewhat.

Why is Capcom talking about these two fighters? Could they be added as DLC characters? Probably not. What's more likely is that it's just a bit of fleshing the universe out for fans. At most, they may be included in the upcoming story mode expansion.

240,The tick rate. ,https://fraghero.com/gamer-unhappy-about-overwatch-feature-thats-worse-than-most-fps-games/,"Overwatch has had a great launch and the servers are performing relatively well. However, there’s a little bit of discomfort within members of the game’s community regarding the tick rate.

In case you are wondering what tick rate is, it is the rate at which the server of the game updates every second. The tick rate of a game plays an important role in the responsiveness of the game. The higher the tick rate is, the more responsive the game becomes.

The players of Overwatch are currently facing several issues regarding responsiveness. There have been instances where the players have taken damage, although they were behind cover such as walls or obstacles. Also, some important commands don’t work in a timely manner.

Overwatch‘s current tick rate is 20.8hz which is very low compared to other games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive or Battefield 4 which have tick rates around 60hz. However, the game has an option which allows the tick rate to be raised up to 62.5hz in custom games with high bandwidth options in the settings, but this will not lessen the lag if you are playing with a player with low bandwidth settings.

The video below by YouTuber Battle(non)sense nicely details Overwatch‘s netcode. The video was also acknowledged by the developers of the game, Blizzard:

Overwatch’s lead engineer Tim Ford said, “Your latency is a factor, processing time, interpolation delay – these are all factors. If you are playing a custom tournament against people across the pond (US to UK/Europe) that 60hz update rate’s probably not going to help much because it’s going to be dominated by a latency.” He added: “It’ll still help – it’ll help a lot. It’ll shave off about 20ms on average from the interpolation delay and about 20ms on from the processing time, so that 40ms zone, assuming everyone has a good solid connection, should be good.”

It is certain that Blizzard has kept the tick rate on the lower side to ensure a smooth launch and not to overload the servers. There is a possibility that they will increase the overall tick rate of the game in the time to come.

In their response to GameSpot’s question of whether they will increase the tick rate on the games apart from the custom ones, Blizzard replied,",Gamers Unhappy About Overwatch Feature That’s Worse Than Most FPS Games,2016-05-27 03:39:57

There are usually very limited consequences so more often than not, it allows players to approach a more careless style of game play.

If you are like me and grew up playing arcade games, you usually understood that once you died and ran out of lives, you had to give up the game to the next person in line. Nowadays with millions of people owning their own consoles and computers to play on, they can afford to die repeatedly in the safety of their own home without the added pressure to stay alive in order to keep playing.

A lot of retro games also came to an end for players if they ran through all of their lives without finishing the game successfully. Caution and strategy are important in a lot of games, but even more so when you were not blessed with infinite chances.

However, there are still a few games around that take death seriously. Ranging from penalties to your adventure to the inability to play a character after death, the consequences of dying are not taken lightly in these games. Some deaths even contribute to buffs for the enemy, so dying over and over again can absolutely hinder your progress in a game.

The downtime will commence at 2 AM PST / 5 AM EST and is expected to run for two hours, ending at 4 AM PST / 7 AM EST.

It's been a big week for The Division. The game's latest free update, 1.2/Conflict, came out on Tuesday, introducing a new Incursion, more PvE content, and changes to the loot system, among other things. For more on the update, check out the full patch notes here.

The new update has not gone entirely to plan, as it's caused some characters to vanish. You can check out this GameSpot story to see even more of The Division's known issues caused by 1.2.

Pysonix has allowed the cross-platform play between the Xbox One and PC versions of Rocket League. The feature was unlocked after an update yesterday at 6 PM ET/3 PM PT.

This is a much awaited feature for the successful vehicle soccer based game, which was promised some time ago. This makes Rocket League the first game to enable cross-platform play between Xbox One and PC. On the other hand, the cross-platform play has already been allowed in Rocket League since its release in PlayStation 4 and PC versions.

Jeremy Dunham, Vice President of Psyonix said, “We’re really excited to bring Xbox One and PC players closer together. Cross-network play has been something that Xbox One gamers have been asking us for since the day we launched, and thanks to Microsoft’s new cross-network policies, we’re proud to give it to them.”

Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that they are interested in allowing Xbox One to support cross network play with Sony’s PlayStation 4. However, Sony didn’t seem too interested in the proposal presented by its counterparts.

While speaking to Eurogamer before, Sony Worldwide Studios’ Shuhei Yoshida said, “Because PC is an open platform it’s much more straightforward. Connecting two different closed networks is much more complicated so we have to work with developers and publishers to understand what it is they are trying to accomplish.” “We also have to look at the technical aspect – and the technical aspect could be the easiest. We also have to look at policy issues and business issues as well.”

Well it is quite unlikely that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One cross-platform play will happen any time soon, but who knows what’s in store for the future.",PC/Xbox One Cross-Platform Play Has Officially Arrived in This Game,2016-05-25 14:50:09

Gamers worldwide are lining up to purchase copies of the game. It’s no surprise that Blizzard is having a hard time meeting the demand for physical copies, and they’re trying their best to catch up.

However, you won’t believe that the company is also having issues keeping up with the demand for the digital version of the game. So much so that it’s making gamers queue up to get a chance to purchase a digital copy of the game.

Wait times range from 3 minutes to 10 minutes and the queues are longer than the ones in brick and mortar stores. This just shows how popular Overwatch is and it is looking poised to break a few records.

There might be several reasons why Blizzard might be doing this. For one, its servers might be genuinely getting clobbered at the moment due to too many people trying to purchase the game at once, but there’s also the possibility that this is just a safety measure to safeguard itself against possible DDOS attacks which might severely hinder its ability to meet demands.

Whatever be the reasons, it’s obvious Blizzard must have considered all other options before taking this measure. It might after eventually force potential buyers from delaying their transaction, and in some rare cases, give up on the idea of buying the game altogether.

The game has been in the news for all the right reasons, be it the extremely well-made animated shorts focusing on the story of its characters, or the highly praised beta for the game.

Overwatch has managed to tick all the right boxes and the surge in demand for the game shows how well things have panned out for Blizzard.",Overwatch Demand Iis So High Blizzard is Using This Desperate Measure to Keep Up,2016-05-24 19:21:52

First, the studio confirmed today that the expansion to the space adventure game will launch for Xbox One on June 3.

The base game launched on Xbox One in April.

The Xbox One edition of Horizons will include the base game and two expansions: Planetary Landings and The Engineers. These add-ons include things like additional missions, new crafting possibilities, and a new vehicle in the form of the Surface Recon Vehicle.

Frontier also confirmed today that The Engineers expansion comes to PC on May 26. Launching alongside that will be Elite Dangerous' ""biggest ever"" free update for all players on all platforms.

Here is what it includes:

""A new mission system, collectable loot, and hundreds of gameplay additions and tweaks. Xbox One players will further benefit from the addition of Private Group play and fully customizable controls.""

Going forward, Frontier mentioned that PC and Xbox One players can expect further expansions, while updates to the game will arrive simultaneously across both platforms. Here is a breakdown of what's to come:

Multicrew, allowing teams of players to assume roles aboard the same ship.

Commander Creation, giving a unique appearance to players' in-game avatars.

Ship-Launched Fighters, allowing larger spacecraft to carry their own short-range fighter craft for attack and defense.

Lastly, Frontier announced that, beginning today, Horizons is available as an upgrade to Elite Dangerous for the lower price of $30. You can also get the game on PC in the Commander Deluxe edition for $60.

On Xbox One, Horizons will launch on June 3 as an upgrade to Elite Dangerous for $30, while the Commander Deluxe edition will also be offered on console for the same price.

A YouTuber called eNinja and his friends, instead of waiting for the launch of the game, decided to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive as Overwatch characters. I am not really sure whether it is productive or not, but the result is definitely entertaining.

The group’s Counter Strike squad consisted of Overwatch characters Tracer, Widowmaker, McCree, Bastion and Roadhog. They did match the avatars and the names of the characters in the game.

Apart from matching the names and avatars, the team also role-played the whole game as the Overwatch characters. They almost made Counter Strike look like Overwatch with their style of play and the messages.

Everyone used the catch phrases of their respective characters. A player almost looked like a turret when McCree started to moving around firing shots from an R8 revolver while Bastion stayed glued to one spot scanning the opponents and killing anyone who comes to his range.

This is the biggest out of the three DLC packs released so far and Bethesda has claimed that it’s their largest DLC pack landmass wise.

/

The developers have released a plethora of DLCs for its games and since it’s a traditionally RPG-based game development company, many of its DLC packs have been massive. Claiming that Far Harbor is huge has definitely got the community talking.

Fraghero has now created a time lapse video of one our editors walking across the entire map of Far Harbor at the slowest pace possible. Make no mistake, the map’s huge and it took us almost 30 minutes to go from one end to another, but is it truly the biggest yet?

It is certainly the biggest when it comes to Fallout games, no other DLC released for any Fallout game comes close, but when compared to another Bethesda developed DLC for Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, it isn’t quite the biggest. Shivering Isles took almost 50% more time when compared to this DLC pack, with the final time coming to around 45 mins mark.

To be fair, it’s still quite a large map and Bethesda’s really delivered a meaty DLC pack in the form of Far Harbor. People are still discovering new things in the DLC and the overall feedback has been positive.

For comparison here are the times it took to walk across the other Fallout games and Oblivion’s Shivering Isles DLC.

Here is the image which will give you an idea of the Far Harbor‘s map:

And here is the Fallout 4‘s basic world map:

By scaling the maps we can come to a conclusion that the size of Far Harbor‘s map is around 20% that of the Commonwealth’s.

Other games are played for a month or two, and are then retired onto bookshelves and external hard drives. Then you have Grand Theft Auto, with devoted fans that keep the game alive years after its initial release.

Since the record breaking Grand Theft Auto V was released nearly three years ago, profits from the game have steadily climbed. The implementation of online DLC has been a cash cow for Rockstar Games as well. The game has done so well that it broke eight Guinness World Records right after its release:

“Grand Theft Auto V has shipped 65 million copies to retailers since it release back in 2013. To put that into perspective, that’s more than the last 3 Call of Duty games combined and roughly the same as the entire Halo franchise.”

252,No.  Thanks Xander for this post!,http://uproxx.com/gammasquad/xbox-one-ps-4-5-upgrade/,"Console wars. Console wars never change. The hardware arms race to superiority will forever dominate as the main motivation for any company not named Nintendo, or so it once seemed. Reports from around the game industry have dubbed a new iteration of the Playstation 4 the Playstation 4.5, or possibly Playstation 4K thanks to its upgraded GPU which will be used for 4K visuals and the fancy Playstation VR headset. The fact that the Playstation 4, which is still a relatively beefy system three years post-launch, needs an upgrade reeks of the days of gaming past, when kids had to walk uphill both ways to find an N64 ram pack so they could finally play co-op Perfect Dark.

Needless to say, pundits, hardcore gamers and industry leaders aren’t impressed. Yes, technology is moving faster than ever, but had even a whiff of this been known back when Sony was the altruistic heroes of the Xbox DRM meltdown before the launch of the next-gen systems, most gamers may have saved up their cash for a gaming PC.

Speaking after Microsoft’s Build 2016 keynote address, Xbox head Phil Spencer told Gamespot he doesn’t believe in the piece by piece upgrading of systems, and you won’t be seeing that with the Xbox One.

“I’m not a big fan of Xbox One and a half. If we’re going to move forward, I want to move forward in big numbers. For us, our box is doing well. It performs, it’s reliable, the servers are doing well. If we’re going to go forward with anything, like I said, I want it to be a really substantial change for people–an upgrade.”

Of course, this could be the first step in a PC-ified home-gaming experience. One in which gamers will intermittently upgrade their systems and won’t have to shell out $500 every 5-7 years, thus rendering their previous console obsolete. If that’s the case, it will be hard to take the first steps, but Sony could be trailblazing, and that’s never easy to do with the gaming crowd.

Executive Vice President of EA Studios, Patrick Soderlund discussed why Star Wars Battlefront didn’t have single player campaign while speaking during EA’s Investor Day event. Soderlund also hinted that the single player campaign might be introduced in the sequel of the game.

The EA Studios boss mentioned that the decision to leave out the campaign mode from Star Wars Battlefront was purposeful. He said that the decision had to be made in order to release the game early to meet the Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

It is notable that Battlefront had content from Jakku which was also relevant in The Force Awakens. The game, however was based on the original Star Wars Trilogy.

Although the game was a commercial success, Soderlund said that he wasn’t happy with the average review score of the game. The game scores 72 in the PC and PlayStation 4 versions and 75 on Xbox One version on Metacritic.

He said, “The one thing that we got criticized for was the lack of a single-player campaign. It was conscious decision we made due to time and being able to launch the game side-by-side with the movie that came out to get the strongest possible impact.” “I think the team created a really good game based on the premise that we had. I would say the game has done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional EA game. So from that perspective, it’s a success. Are we happy with the 75 rating? No. Is that something we’re going to cure going forward? Absolutely,” he added.

Despite not having a single-player campaign mode, Battlefront does have solo and offline ‘Missions’. He also detailed how EA is looking into the ‘depth and breadth’ before starting a new project.

“The depth and breadth is something that’s proving to be more and more important,” he said. “In a world where we want $60 up front and we expect people to stay with us over the course of a long time, the depth of what we offer is important.” Soderlund added, “We have to go back and course correct that for another version if we were ever to build one.”

On the other hand, EA CFO Blake Jorgenssen said last week that they were working on a sequel to Battlefront which will include content from the recent movies and have better and bigger worlds.

Keeping in mind, Soderlund’s comments, it is safe to assume that the sequel will also feature a single-player campaign, which is bound to strike the right chords with fans.

Update: EA has now confirmed that Star Wars: Battlefront 2 will have a single player campaign.

254,The Vice President played a demo and changed his mind. ,https://fraghero.com/battlefield-1s-world-war-1-setting-was-initially-rejected/,"Image: Battlefield.com

EA’s upcoming game Battlefield 1 has received a lot of attention since the reveal trailer was released earlier this month. The main reason of excitement for this new AAA game is the setting.

Unlike most of the other shooting games nowadays, which are set in modern or futuristic universe, Battlefield 1 is set during World War I. This will definitely give the players some new experience and a fresh perspective.

Although we are all excited about Battlefield 1, we are actually lucky that the game’s setting didn’t get rejected. While speaking at the Investors Day event, EA Studios Executive Vice President Patrick Soderlund said that the setting was originally not approved by EA.

The thing that Andrew spoke about in regards to the setting and why we decided to go for World War I, it wasn’t the most obvious choice. If you look at what other partners in our industry are going, they’re going into sci-fi, we had a lot of success with in the modern military space, but we felt that there was a need for a change, and when the team presented to me the idea of World War I, I absolutely rejected it.”

However, things changed after DICE showed him a small demo of what it had in mind. This convinced him that the idea could actually work and the company bit the bullet and it paid off big time.

I said , World War I is trench warfare, it can’t be fun to play.’ But anyway the team continued to persist in the fact that this can be fun, and showed up with a very short demo that convinced me at least that this was the right path

Soderlund was amazed by the reception the trailer for Battlefield 1 got and he seemed very pleased that the audience connected in the way it did with the company’s decision to switch from modern-day setting to world war 1.

The good news is that whenever you take creative risks, and it works, you actually can get to substantial success, and I think that what the internet is telling us with 31 million views and the most seen trailer of the history of EA is that the World War I theme is resonating with players out there. I think we have done something that will be right for the franchise and right for EA.”

255,"A writer is skeptical about this. So, no. ",http://www.infoworld.com/article/3070678/linux/can-linux-ever-beat-windows-at-pc-gaming.html,"Can Linux ever beat Windows at PC gaming?

Windows has long been the undisputed king of computer operating systems when it comes to gaming. But is Linux getting to the point where it can take on Windows in PC gaming?

A writer at TechRadar remains quite skeptical about the possibility of Linux someday becoming the top gaming operating system for PCs.

Game Carey reports for TechRadar:

Evidently, Windows isn’t going anywhere, with a Steam market share of nearly 96% as of March 2016. In fact, Epic Games even recently called Microsoft out on trying to “monopolize” PC gaming with its Universal Windows Platform initiatives. Although Microsoft has lost sight of what PC gamers want in recent years (see: Games for Windows Live), there’s no doubt that the current Xbox head Phil Spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the Xbox One into Windows 10. In contrast, Valve’s attempts at making Linux not only the best place to play games from your Steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. Despite making an effort with SteamOS, it doesn’t help that a number of companies still haven’t released their November 2015-bound Steam Machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system’s handicaps. There’s a clear winner here, and unless Linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the OS to beat for PC gaming will remain Windows 10.

DistroWatch reviews FreeBSD 10.3’s new features

Jesse Smith at DistroWatch did a full review of FreeBSD 10.0 a while back, and now he has some thoughts to share about the new features that have been added to the recently released FreeBSD 10.3.

Jesse Smith reports for DistroWatch:

FreeBSD is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project’s focus on performance and stability. At the beginning of April the FreeBSD project released version 10.3 of their operating system. The release announcement for FreeBSD 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. Specifically the availability of ZFS boot environments, 64-bit Linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. I was especially eager to try out FreeBSD’s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. The iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) Warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. One of the first things I wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. For those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. Before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. This gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. We then perform any changes or upgrades we want. When we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. This allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. This makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. The PC-BSD and openSUSE projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. The next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit Linux compatibility. FreeBSD has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run Linux executables. There are some restrictions though. For example, up until now the Linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. There is a package in the FreeBSD repository which installs the CentOS core userland software. In essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of CentOS 6 in a directory on our FreeBSD computer. This is handy if we need to run Linux software alongside FreeBSD software or if we want to run Linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. The final feature I wanted to look at was FreeBSD jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older Warden jail management software. Jails on FreeBSD are basically very lightweight virtual machines. Part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. What primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host’s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of FreeBSD. In recent years Docker has provided similar functionality on Linux. More at DistroWatch

Linus Torvalds releases Linux kernel 4.6

Linus has been very busy working on the next release of the Linux kernel, and now Linux 4.6 has been released into the wild.

Simon Sharwood reports on what's new in Linux kernel 4.6 for The Register:

New this time around is support for a bunch more ARM systems-on-a-chip, including Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820. IBM’s POWER9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won’t arrive until late 2016. Whatever CPU you use to run Linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, OrangeFS, XFS, Btrfs and EXT 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while F2FS is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage. Dell’s laptops will play nicer with Linux thanks to driver changes that permit hotkeys to be pressed into service. Raspberry Pi users may appreciate new drivers that are said to do lovely things for 3D graphics performance. More at The Register

256,If there is enough demand.  Thank you Corbin for the heads up on this!,https://fraghero.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-remasters-developed-one-condition/,"With Activision releasing a remastered Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare later this year and the rising popularity of backwards compatibility, it looks like EA might draft up some remastered Battlefield games in the future. Even though the overall production of remastered games has slowed down for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, it is still something that players desire, especially when it comes to beloved games that many gamers spent hours upon hours playing on last gen consoles.

Talk of remastered Battlefield games can be exciting, especially since the original title, Battlefield 1942, was only released on PC and might be a great addition to the ever-growing collection of first-person shooters available on consoles.

Patrick Soderlund, EA Studios Executive Vice-President, had a recent interview with International Business Times and the topic of remastered Battlefield games was brought up. It looks like there isn’t currently a remaster in the works as of yet, but if there is enough demand from fans the tables can absolutely be turned.

“I wouldn’t say never. We’re not doing it right now, we’re focused on Battlefield 1 – but if we think the fans want that I see no reason we couldn’t.” – Patrick Soderlund

Soderlund further discussed additional details on the upcoming release of Battlefield 1, touching on Zeppelins, the ability to ride horses, and the implementation of aquatic vehicles. With so much work involved with this game, it’s no wonder that remastered versions of previous Battlefield games is not currently on the priority list.

257,Call of Duty: Black Ops coming to the Xbox One's backwards compatibility program. ,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-dev-teases-something-for-today-update/1100-6439878/,"[UPDATE] It looks like the announcement Ybarra was referring to was Call of Duty: Black Ops coming to the Xbox One's backwards compatibility program.

The original story is below.

It looks like Microsoft may have some kind of an announcement to make today. Xbox engineering lead Mike Ybarra posted a cryptic message on Twitter last night, signalling something for later today.

Here is the tweet in question:

It would appear that something Xbox-related will be revealed/detailed today. He posted the tweet at 10:21 PM, so 13.5 hours from then would be around 11-12 today.

We'll keep our eyes on this and report back with new information when it becomes available.

Ybarra is a partner director for the Xbox and Windows platforms. He heads up the development on updates for Xbox One and Windows 10 PC, though that doesn't necessarily mean that's what this tease pertains to.

There are also rumors swirling around about Microsoft potentially announcing new hardware. Recently, Xbox boss Phil Spencer even said Microsoft would talk about things ""beyond"" Xbox One and Windows 10 relatively soon. Microsoft's E3 briefing in June is expected to bring even more news, on top of whatever ends up being shown today.

Obsidian is starting work on Pillars of Eternity 2, CEO Feargus Urquhart revealed in an interview with Gamepressure, although 'revealed' might be too grand.

""Eternity 2 is not announced,"" Urquhart says, ""[but] it seems silly for me not to acknowledge it, though. If someone asks, 'Are you working on it?', I respond, 'Well, wouldn’t you work on it?'. So then they say, 'So you must be working on it', and then I’m like, 'Well, yeah.'""

Urquhart also disclosed that Obsidian might return to crowdfunding for Eternity 2, at which point I winced. I feel like crowdfunding is something a ballsy start-up should wean itself off with the success of its first project. Sure, it's earned the public's trust with an excellent first outing, but it's also earned our money.

That said, Obsidian has a lot going on. Urquhart referenced a third project in addition to this year's Tyranny.

259,If they use cheats while playing the game it’s going to result in a permanent ban. ,https://fraghero.com/blizzards-warning-to-overwatch-players-would-make-them-think-twice-before-using-cheats/,"Players thinking they might get away with using cheats or exploits in Blizzard’s upcoming team-based MMO Overwatch are going to be left disappointed. The company has made it clear it is going to enforce a no nonsense policy against cheaters.

It’s warned Overwatch players that if they use cheats, even once, while playing the game, it’s going to result in a permanent ban for them. This was announced on the game’s official forums over at Battle.net. The post discussed in details its policy against cheaters and how explained how players can report any suspicious activities they notice while playing the game.

If a player is found to be cheating — or using hacks, bots, or third-party software that provides any sort of unfair advantage — that player will be permanently banned from the game. Full stop,” the company said. “Not only does cheating undermine the spirit of fair play that all of our products are based on, but it works to diminish the fun and enjoyment of others. While we are unlikely to publicly acknowledge when accounts are closed as a result of cheating or using unauthorized programs, we have and will continue to monitorOverwatch for exploitative behavior, as well as take action as needed to preserve the integrity of game.

Blizzard revealed that cheaters can be reported by the community by using an in-game reporting system, that’s present in the PC version, or they can simply email Blizzard at hacks@blizzard.com.

Blizzard assured the community that it’ll be using a complex set of tools to verify if the reports of cheating are accurate, and it won’t solely rely on the game’s replay system to make a decision.

It’s important to note that while video evidence from killcams, Plays of the Game, Highlights, and other community captured footage can be very helpful, we will never use it alone to verify whether or not cheating is taking place. As a result, we encourage players to play nice, play fair and avoid publicly accusing individuals of cheating whenever possible and instead use the reporting methods detailed above.

Overwatch had an overwhelmingly successful open beta and players did more than just the play the game as a result of it. The game releases on May 24 for PC, Xbox One and PS4.",Blizzard’s warning to Overwatch players would make them think twice before using cheats,2016-05-17 07:09:55

Looking through Capcom's plans for the coming year, Videogamer has discovered that the company has three currently unannounced titles that it is due to release before April 2017.

The titles in question aren't minor releases either - one of them is expected to shift 4 million units within the financial year, while the second title should hit between 2 and 4 million units, and the final one should be in the 2 million range.

One of the titles is a Monster Hunter game and, given Capcom's statement that was widely reported yesterday regarding a 'full-scale offensive' for Resident Evil this year, it's probably safe to say at least one of them is a Resident Evil game as well.

Kiss FM reports that a 10-year-old football fan named Roman was given surprise NFL tickets for Christmas from his grandma. The tickets were for the controversial Dallas Cowboys vs. Detroit Lions game last week. Outside the AT&T stadium (based in Dallas), Roman won a local contest during a pregame fan event which consisted of musical chairs. The people officiating the event were associated with the Cowboys (you can tell because of their clothing and the Cowboy mascot on stage), which makes sense considering the location. After winning multiple games of musical chairs, Roman was supposed to get a free copy of Madden NFL 15 on PS4. Upon the realization that Roman was wearing a Lions jersey underneath his jacket, the boy was made to redo the final round. Despite originally winning, someone else won the grand prize because of the clothing Roman was wearing. Roman ended up getting a Batman DVD instead (a full season of the original Adam West series that he most likely didn't even know existed).

Fortunately, EA Sports stepped in and rectified things for young Roman a few days later. Not only did he get a copy of Madden NFL 15, he also got a brand new PlayStation 4 as well as a Detroit Lions mini-helmet signed by his favorite player, wide receiver Calvin Johnson.

265,"Virtual reality will get more physical, will become and industry-wide effort, and a wireless Rift or Vive won’t happen soon. ",http://time.com/4324598/alienware-interview-virtual-reality/?xid=time_socialflow_facebook,"Strap on a rectangular black headset, and you can traverse a sunken ship at the bottom of the ocean or climb to the top of a snowcapped mountain. That’s the promise of virtual reality (VR) headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.

As impressive as the technology already is, many believe it’s still in its early days. That’s because previous virtual reality-style efforts have flopped in the past. (Nintendo’s Virtual Boy comes to mind.) But the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more.

Few have watched virtual reality evolve as closely as the companies building the hardware that powers it. TIME sat down with Frank Azor, general manager of the Dell-owned gaming PC manufacturer Alienware, and Nelson Gonzalez, Alienware’s cofounder and former CEO, to discuss what they have learned about VR and where they believe it’s headed. Below are the key highlights from our conversation.

Read more: Virtual Reality Buyers Guide: Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive vs. Samsung Gear VR

Virtual reality will get more physical

Anyone who’s seen or tried the HTC Vive knows that some physical activity is involved. The Vive and its two controllers are equipped with sensors that allow players to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush.

But what systems like the Vive or PlayStation VR currently lack is a sense of touch. Although it may look like you’re swinging a golf club, the device in your hand still feels like a video game controller. (The Oculus Rift doesn’t yet support any motion controllers, although the company plans to launch such devices later in 2016.) This is going to be one of the first areas in which virtual reality will improve, says Gonzalez.

“The next evolution of VR would be where you participate physically in that VR world,” Gonzalez said. “And not just sitting down; if you’re a quarterback, you actually get to throw a football, and you can interface with the team. So that kind of stuff, it’s there, it’s going to happen.”

Incorporating better touch controls will only be the start. Azor believes future VR devices could refine concepts first introduced as far back as 1962 with the Sensorama, which incorporated elements like wind and smells.

“Headsets today are doing an excellent job at catering to your visual senses, and a little bit of audio as well,” said Azor, also Alienware’s fourth employee. “Well that’s just two of the senses . . . Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual piece begins to fade.”

It’s unclear exactly how — and if — technologies like those Azor described will ever take shape. But some companies are certainly trying. Leap Motion, a startup which launched a motion-sensing camera for computers in 2013, is now building technology for interacting with VR environments without a controller. Startup Thalmic Labs also makes an armband capable of controlling electronic devices through gestures that works with the Rift.

Read more: Review: Oculus Rift is expensive, complicated, and totally wonderful

VR is an industry-wide effort

The Oculus Rift will likely be remembered as the first modern virtual reality headset. But it takes more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way, says Azor.

Azor draws comparisons to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade. PCs became better equipped to deliver high-end gaming experiences as companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia developed more powerful chips and graphics processors. Games became more accessible on PCs as companies like Steam created platforms for easily buying and browsing content.

“Everyone rallied around [the PC gaming] industry and now we have what we have today,” he said. “VR is the same type of thing; no one company can solve all of the problems.”

A wireless Rift or Vive won’t happen soon

There are two classes of virtual reality devices available today: cheaper, portable devices like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard, and beefier, expensive systems that offer more immersive experiences like the Rift and the Vive. The former plug into your smartphone to deliver VR that’s wireless and convenient, while the latter must be tethered to a PC to power their higher-end performance.

It’s unlikely that we’ll see a high-performance device like the Rift go wireless anytime soon, mostly because wireless technology isn’t advancing at the same pace as VR hardware.

“By the time we solve that, as an industry we’re going to want to give you version two of the product, which is going to become the new benchmark,” Azor said. “Wireless technology is on a different schedule, that’s where the issue comes in . . . The latest and greatest will be wired for a fair amount of time moving forward.”

Any gamer can tell you: Video games ain't cheap. But some systems are certainly more affordable than others.

Quartz reporter Mike Murphy compiled a new collection of data showcasing the price of video game consoles, adjusted for inflation. The results certainly put the $599 Oculus Rift into perspective, as the all-time priciest system is the relatively obscure Neo Geo, which launched in 1990 for the equivalent of $1,179 today. (It was $649.99 back then.)

Take a look:

At least you were getting your money's worth from the Neo Geo. Somewhat unbelievably, the system was still supported as late as 2004, when its final game -- ""Samurai Shodown V Special"" -- was released.

The chart also reveals that Nintendo systems have always been pretty good values. All things equal, Nintendo consoles fall toward the bottom of the list, perhaps because the company places such emphasis on first-party software like ""Mario Kart"" and ""Super Smash Brothers."" The company makes a lot of money on its own games and original properties, in other words.

Some might complain Nintendo's systems also seem a bit outdated by the time they're released -- in terms of sheer horsepower, the Wii lagged behind the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, much as the Wii U is technically less impressive than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

Uncharted 4: A Thief's End launches today.

However if one of those people picking up a physical copy of the game instead of downloading from the PSN store, then you need to know that there's also a whopping 4.978GB day one patch that also need to be downloaded on top of the main game.

The update is essential to the game and prevents players from jumping into the games multiplayer straight away (if that's your thing), on top of a few other core features from the game.

In addition to the multiplayer, the patch also adds the following features to the game:

• Encounter Selection• Character model viewer• Render mode• Single-player skins• Photo Mode

There's also a number of smaller general bug fixes and improvements.

Despite the patch, all players will still be able to continue their adventure through the games main campaign whilst the patch downloads in the background.

So you won't be completely stopped from enjoying, what we believe, is the best game you'll ever see on the PS4.

While we've got you it's also worth reminding you to download a new Uncharted mobile game where you can unlock exclusive rewards for Uncharted 4 before it’s released.

It’s called Uncharted: Fortune Hunter and it’s available as a free download now for iPhone, iPad and Android users.

Effectively this is a top-down puzzle game, where you guide a tiny Nate around mazes.

Occasionally it changes it up bit with some switches or an explosive barrel.

Even Sully drops by now and again.

Completing the puzzles gives you more keys. Keys can then be used to unlock boxes. And boxes contain all sorts of exclusive look for you to use within Uncharted 4's multiplayer.

There’s exclusive outfits, skins and also one-time use boosters.

You’ll even be able to obtain a range of other items, obtainable via Sully's treasure chests in the app.

Call of Duty Modern Warfare: Remastered is coming, bundled exclusively with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare's special edition release later this year.

But if you were at all worried that this might be nothing more than a glorified HD upscale, with a new lick of paint, then dont you worry.

269,"A little jaggy, but not bad. ",http://www.techtimes.com/articles/157417/20160511/how-does-overwatch-hold-up-on-consoles.htm,"At times, it feels like Overwatch has been in beta for as long as gamers have known about it.

Blizzard clearly wants to make sure its first new IP in more than 15 years knocks it out of the park: not only have select fans been able to test the game out a number of times over the past year, but the Overwatch team has been quick to incorporate and respond to feedback. Long story short, you simply don't see this sort of long-term, hands-on development cycle very often.

Then again, that last statement really only applies to the PC side of things. Obviously, Blizzard is making sure that the game is the same across all three platforms, but until the recent open beta, console players never had a chance to play Overwatch. PC players knew that the game would be good going in ... but what about fans with an Xbox One or PlayStation 4?

Let's be honest: there's a very good chance that Overwatch will be remembered as a PC game more than anything else. Blizzard is a company that was defined by its library of amazing PC games, and it wasn't until recently that the studio's games even appeared on consoles at all. Thankfully, Overwatch is just as strong on consoles as it is on PC - though fans should expect to see a few differences between the platforms.

If you've played Overwatch on more than one platform, then chances are the first thing you noticed were the differences in presentation. With a decently powerful rig, Overwatch looks absolutely gorgeous: effects and explosions are particularly impressive, though the high-res textures and lighting systems deserve mention as well. It may feature a stylized presentation, but that hasn't stopped Blizzard from making yet another stunning game.

For the most part, the same could be said of the console versions. Both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One manage to hit the 60 fps benchmark and hold it, only dropping a few frames when explosions and Ultimates start flooding the screen. Even then, the frame drops are small and inconsistent - unless you're looking back through recorded footage, chances are you'll never notice it.

The only thing that doesn't seem to hold up is the anti-aliasing: while PC players can choose which settings work best for their system, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions suffer from a bit of aliasing. Again, you won't really notice it if you're not looking for it, though it does stick out as the only notable visual difference.

To this day, the debate between using a mouse-and-keyboard versus playing with a controller still rages on. Some will still say that PC hardware provides the most accurate aiming possible, while others prefer the comfort and simplicity provided by a controller.

Overwatch fans using a mouse-and-keyboard setup probably won't notice anything out of the ordinary. Overwatch plays like any other FPS out there: point, click and hope that your opponent drops before you do. The control scheme may be different than others in the genre, but the actual mechanics of aiming remain the same.

Thankfully, the same could be said when using a controller. While you may have to tweak the sensitivity to your liking, Overwatch still plays beautifully with a pair of analog sticks. It does give the game a slightly different feel, and auto-aim may rub a few people the wrong way, but Blizzard has done a great job of giving console players the same level of control (no pun intended) as PC players.

In most console shooters, players are basically locked into a control scheme - Blizzard, on the other hand, has given console users the ability to completely customize their controls. It may sound simple, but the fact that players can set up separate horizontal and vertical look sensitivities is a big deal - and it could go a long way toward making the game that much more accessible for new players.

It should come as no surprise that Overwatch is a great game. This is Blizzard we're talking about, a company that's willing to completely cancel a game and scrap years of work before releasing a bad game. On top of that, PC players have known that the game was fun ever since the first beta dropped late last year.

However, console players have been burned before.

Overwatch has garnered more than a few comparisons to Team Fortress 2, and for good reason. However, while Team Fortress 2 is still a staple of PC gaming, the sub-par console version died a quick, painful death. There are plenty of players who worry that the same would happen to Overwatch.

While it's still too early to tell what the future holds for Blizzard's new shooter, console fans can rest assured that the game is definitely worth playing on their platform of choice. Overwatch may be known as a PC-centric title now, but we wouldn't be surprised if a dedicated console community popped up, too.

For the time being, we'll just have to wait and see: Overwatch is set for release on May 24.

The World War I setting is confirmed, though reports of this being an alternate history are completely inaccurate according to DICE. Battlefield 1 will feature a full campaign, though details are vague beyond its existence.

As expected, the setting will give EA and DICE a push toward trench warfare, though vehicles will, of course, return. This time out, the multiplayer will feature specific classes for vehicles, including pilots and tank drivers.

Battlefield 1 will be out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 21. The date mentioned in the poster below refers to EA and Origin Access early play time that begins on October 18.

Update 2: Another shot of materials includes what may very well be the release date for the game. If accurate, the next Battlefield is launching on October 18. Additionally, as managing editor Matt Bertz pointed out to me when the keyart first appeared, the Harlem Hellfighters (mentioned on one of the posters and officially known as the 369th Infantry Division) is connected to the game. The regiment consisted of African Americans and worked closely with the French during the war.

The setting was rumored earlier this year, but we’ll learn more later today when the game is revealed. We had some thoughts about a Battlefield game set in World War I, which you can read here.
