The Israeli actress has appeared in some of the biggest movies of the last several years, including four entries in the Fast and the Furious franchise and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. She’ll also reprise the role of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman in the DC Extended Universe’s Justice League, which is due out later this year. But if Gadot’s face is nigh inescapable, she’s not yet a household name—and even people who do know her name usually say it wrong.

Perhaps it’s the similarity to the absent title figure of Samuel Beckett’s most famous play, but the go-to pronunciation for Gadot’s surname tends to treat it as if it’s French: Guh-DOH. But as mentioned above, Gadot is not French: She’s Israeli, and she pronounces her name, quiet sensibly, in the Israeli fashion, which is to say with a hard T and a short O: Guh-DOTT. Here’s Jimmy Kimmel, making a good effort but not quite getting it right.

One last tip. The correct pronunciation of “I am upset that a movie that is opening on well over 2,000 screens will have a tiny number of individual showings whose audience is voluntarily limited to women” is “Boo-HOO.”","How to pronounce Gal Gadot, the star of Wonder Woman."

Season 7 of Game of Thrones is teased in new trailer

The four-legged star behind Jon Snow's faithful companion passed away this week at the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary

Game Of Thrones author George R.R. Martin has made the sad announcement today that the real-life wolf who played Ghost is dead.

Jon Snow's faithful companion was played by an albino Arctic Wolf and lived at the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary in Nex Mexico, USA.

The four-legged star of HBO's fantasy drama, who passed away this week, was part of a pack that lived at the rescue centre supported by the Martin family.

Breaking the news on Twitter, Martin said: ""In loving memory of the real life Ghost from the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary. He passed this week & he will be missed. R.I.P""

Fans of the show took to Twitter to give their sympathies and hope that the direwolf won't be killed off in the books or the show.

Ghost is one of the only two remaining Stark direwolves in Game Of Thrones, but Nymeria has been missing since the first season.

The runt of the litter, who was gifted to illegitimate Stark Jon Snow, quickly became popular amongst fans during his time at the Wall.

Ghost was clearly distinguishable from the other family pets due to his albino fur and striking red eyes.

Game Of Thrones fans have had to deal with the tragic deaths of four direwolves on the show, but hope Ghost could possibly sit at his master's side by the Iron Throne.

Meanwhile, fans of the show have found out that they won't have to wait too long for its return.

The release date for season 7 has finally been announced in a brand new teaser

Fans of the hit HBO series have been forced to wait over a year for their next fix of Westeros, but the wait will soon be over.

The next series will premiere on July 16th, where viewers will see the battle for the Seven Kingdoms get into full swing as Daenerys Targaryen sails across from Essos to face Queen Cersei.

However, the teaser shows the danger about to come down from the north, as the camera pans slowly moves out from the evil blue eye of the Night King to reveal his dark face.

The official Game Of Thrones twitter account tweeted: "" #GoTS7 begins 7.16 on @HBO . #GameofThrones

While the battle for the Iron Throne wages on in the south, the threat everyone should really be focusing on is the White Walkers.

Fans couldn't contain their excitement over the new teaser, but were slightly disappointed that another full trailer has not been released

Just three weeks after the first trailer dropped, new snaps were released showing Queen Cersei sitting regally on the Iron Throne with her brother-slash-lover Jaime Lannister standing beside her with his impressive sword on display.

Cersei - who spent the last season behind stripped naked and humiliated as punishment for her infidelity - wears a simple metal crown and chain mail armour, suggesting she'll be doing battle to cement her status as royalty in the upcoming series.

Other pictures show Lyanna Mormont, who up until Season 6 was a little-known character until she proclaimed her house for Jon Stark, declaring him the King of the North.

The upcoming series also catches up with Gilly and Samwell Tarly, who can be seen studying some books in a dark room. Gilly is reading, suggesting Samwell has achieved his goal of educating her since they fled from her abusive husband.

Daenerys Targaryen is back, looking serious as she surveys a scene in front of her. She wears a dragon badge on her outfit, but there are no signs of her three dragon 'offspring'.

Tyrion - by now Daenerys' Hand, or chief advisor - is in place beside her, alongside Varys 'the Spider', Grey Worm and Missandei.

"""...I always thought I was the most outsider, weird person in the movie, and, 'Why was I cast in it?' and I had no voice."" ",http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1653270/why-diane-keaton-hasnt-watched-the-godfather-in-30-years,"While Diane Keaton might not be the first name that comes to mind when you think about The Godfather, her performance as Michael Corleone's long suffering wife Kaye Adams is still a fine and memorable turn in the classic movie. It turns out that Diane Keaton herself has actually been disregarding her work in The Godfather, too. The legendary actress has now admitted that, until recently, she hadn't watched The Godfather in around 30 years because she always saw herself as the outsider in the film. Diane Keaton admitted,

I was so shocked because I never did pay that much attention to The Godfather because I always thought I was the most outsider, weird person in the movie, and, 'Why was I cast in it?' and I had no voice. But then I had a couple of good scenes with Al.

Of course, Diane Keaton isn't wrong with her assumption, because Kay Adams-Corleone is one of the few non-Italian characters in both The Godfather and The Godfather Part II. In fact, Kay Adams is constantly kept at arms length regarding the family business throughout the films, and as things escalate throughout the second movie, the audience even sees her become a prisoner in her own home. Still, The Godfather is a movie that's on cable fairly often, and you'd have at least expected Diane Keaton to have a quick peek at her performance at some point over the last thirty years, especially since she's in the iconic final shot of the first film.

Diane Keaton admitted at the Tribeca Film Festival that she finally sat herself down to re-watch The Godfather for the first time in three decades recently. As you'd expect the actress was blown away by just how engrossing and gripping the gangster epic was, especially because she still found herself overwhelmed by the film even though she was watching it on a computer. Diane Keaton recalled,

I saw it on my computer. I hadn't seen it for I think about 30 years. And I looked at 1, and I just remember all the people, I couldn't handle it, it was so astonishing, it was so beautiful, and everybody is so great in it, and the music, and every choice [Francis Ford Coppola] made. And that damn Talia -- I saw you in that scene with all the fighting. And then you had slow, long scenes. Everything was astonishing to me. And I was totally surprised because I didn't expect it. And on a fucking computer.

Diane Keaton made the above revelations during the emotional reunion of The Godfather's cast and crew at the closing night of The Tribeca Film Festival on Saturday night, which came after the first two films were screened back to back over an absorbing 7 and a half hour period. As well as Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and co-writer and director Francis Ford Coppola took part in the wide-ranging discussion, which was hosted by director Taylor Hackford and was supposed to last 45 minutes but actually went on for an hour and twenty. I will forever be thanking my lucky stars that I was in attendance at the once in a life-time event, and stay glued to CinemaBlend over the next few days for further stories and revelations from the panel.

In addition, Paramount will release all three films in the epic Godfather crime saga on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD on Tuesday, May 9.",Why Diane Keaton Hadn’t Watched The Godfather In 30 Years

Disney is slowly collecting a nice slew of voice talent for their upcoming live-action Lion King. First, there was Donald Glover playing Simba, along with James Earl Jones returning as the voice the wise Mufasa. The studio is pretty keen on snagging Queen B to play Queen of the Jungle, Nala. And now, they’ve announced who’s taking on the roles of jungle best-friends forever and ever:

Timone and Pumbaa will be played by – drumroll, please — Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner.

The Walking Dead has become more about gore than storytelling. ,http://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/fans-leaving-show-season-walking-dead/,"HAS THE WALKING DEAD KILLED THEIR FANS?

According to The Verge, and several Twitter fans of The Walking Dead, many die-hards are leaving the show this season after the opening episode of Season 7 where we lost Glenn and Abraham. They’re also leaving in troves as the ratings have dropped to an all time low since Season 3.

Rest assured: these numbers DO predict the future of the shows that run on TV. With the recent backlash of gore, Walking Dead even had to cut back the blood in Fat Joey’s death.

They are listening to the fans, but some have gone completely rogue and are boycotting the show at every turn.

The main reason people are leaving isn’t just because two leads were killed, where only one was expected to die. If that were the case, there wouldn’t be anyone left to watch Game of Thrones, where leads die off in packs.

The reason people are leaving is that they feel the creators are more about the shock value of the show than the story. Essentially, the series has gotten to a point where it’s more into manipulating its audience than being faithful.

Obviously, this is somewhat of a double-edged sword. While it can’t be denied, why would fans want everything exactly like the comic series? Have we not developed a degree of trust in a show so powerful? Is it possible that these thoughts are just from fair-weather fans?

Blaming Showrunner Scott Gimple

Some fans blame new showrunner, Scott Gimble, saying he took an emotionally charged show that involved zombie deaths and character growth and turned it into torture porn, rather than a network drama.

The evidence for this idea started in Season 6 when we went down the rabbit hole as the gang was trying to escape. Again, this can be argued both ways. Were we manipulated or were we given a chance to feel scared for our heroes?

Other points of manipulation include Glenn’s dumpster death (which even involved removing his name from the credits). They leaked bashed-in-head photos online. And yes, they filmed everyone to avoid actual leaks, but this seems no different than Christopher Nolan keeping his work private. They kept Negan’s identity secret. But again, this is somewhat of a stretch and is more about storytelling. Consider the opening of The Departed where we don’t see Nicholson’s face, but merely a silhouette for the first few scenes to add drama.

Will Negan Make Rick Stronger?

Whatever your opinion, this all lead up to the premiere where Glenn and Abraham were killed by the hands of Negan in a horrific manner involving Lucille, Negan’s trustworthy baseball bat.

Later, when Negan was attempting to force Rick to cut off his son’s arm, some refer to this as cruel and violent, as well as cheap tension. Again, this feels like something necessary to change Carl and Rick’s relationship within the story. To a degree, whatever Negan does will make Rick stronger.

While it would appear to be best to defend the series, those who are leaving seem to have their minds set. They feel that the show has left its roots of character development, which could tie in with the fact that we already know King Ezekiel’s background, something that may have been kept secret longer before.

Whatever these quitters feel about this new fork in the road, one can’t help but think of a favorite team’s losing season after a big win. Fewer jerseys line the store windows, and ticket prices are lower, but maybe it’s because the fans just haven’t screamed loud enough.

We’ll find out soon enough.

"He played it. The song was ""You Can Never Tell"" by the late Chuck Berry. ",http://en.newsner.com/crowd-asks-springsteen-to-play-another-singer-s-song-his-response-leaves-them-speechless/about/music,"These days, performers usually prepare every detail of their concerts ahead of time. Especially when they are world-class artists like Bruce Springsteen.

But if you’re accomplished as much as Springsteen has, you can pretty much do whatever you want.

So when Bruce saw a sign in the audience during a concert in Leipzig, Germany asking him to play “You Can Never Tell” from the cult movie “Pulp Fiction,” he handled it, well, like a boss.

Bruce started by trying a couple of different keys and consulting with his band. In front of a crowd of 45,000, “The Boss” was straining. Not even the band could hide their surprise, and I can’t even imagine how the promoters and organizers were feeling.

Then a few seconds later, Bruce and the band gave it a shot—and I need hardly mention that the performance was a smashing success.

"The lyric ""Only shootin' stars break the mold"" was originally ""Wave bye bye to your soul"" ",http://www.spin.com/2017/02/original-handwritten-lyrics-show-smash-mouths-all-star-was-almost-a-much-darker-song/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=timeline,"Smash Mouth’s “All Star” is a motivational speech wrapped in a pop song. “Hey now! You’re a rock star, get the show on, get paid,” and so on. There doesn’t seem to be much ambiguity in its message: being an all star is cool, being a rock star is cool, getting paid is definitely cool, and hey, you never know–if you give yourself a shot and aim for the skies, you might break the mold and become an all star, too. Cool!

But according to an original draft of the lyrics, penned by original Smash Mouth guitarist Greg Camp and tweeted out from the band’s account this afternoon, there might be a darker side to living out your dreams of riches and celebrity.

At the end of the chorus, there’s a line crossed out, with the lyric that made the final cut–“And only shooting stars [will] break the mold”–shoved into the margin. Look closely, and you can read the original draft underneath the scribbles: “Wave bye bye to your soul.”

That single line puts a darkly ironic twist on a song that otherwise seems pretty naive: sure, you can live only for fun, hit the ground running, take the backstreets, and set your world on fire–you’ll shine, you’ll glow, but you might lose the very thing that makes you human in the process. Being a rock star is fun and all, but sooner or later, you end up alone on the tour bus, surrounded by empty bottles, staring into a tiny handheld mirror, wondering where your high school sweetheart is and what things would have been like if you’d taken a different path. (Or maybe I’m just projecting.)

Look at the top of the lyrics sheet (which the band has tweeted out at least once before), and you’ll also notice a subtle perspective shift in the first verse. “All Star” originally opened not with an unnamed somebody looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an “L” on her forehead, but with the song’s narrator, Mr. All Star himself, as the dumb one. What does it all mean?

With the “bye bye to your soul” thing in mind, all sorts of other hidden depths of “All Star” start to reveal themselves. There’s that glancing reference to climate change in the second verse, for one thing. And isn’t the assertion in the chorus that all that glitters is in fact gold just a little to peppy and on-the-nose to be taken at face value? The darkness and mystery implied in “All Star” inspired one incredibly devoted Smash Mouth fan to compile a Reddit post two years ago, explaining in detail why “Smash Mouth’s song “All Star” is about the exact opposite everyone thinks it is.”

We may never know the band’s reason for cutting the “soul” line and replacing it with much more saccharine lyrics about shooting stars. But if “All Star” really is about the ultimate hollowness of contemporary life, I guess there’s a lot more going on in the opening sequence of Shrek than we gave it credit for, too.",Original Handwritten Lyrics Show Smash Mouth’s “All Star” Was Almost a Much Darker Song
Joss Whedon has to be willing to work on the series. ,http://epicstream.com/news/Fox-is-Open-to-Rebooting-Firefly-But-Only-Under-This-Condition,"Fox already brought more episodes of X-Files and Prison Break before, but some fans are wondering if there's a chance that they would reboot Firefly. Creator Joss Whedon's sci-fi western was canceled after its first season, but the story was continued in a film titled Serenity. Fans of the show, a.k.a. Browncoats, have been wishing for the franchise's revival since well...it's cancellation. And while many believe that it's too late for a second season, Fox Broadcasting President of Entertainment, David Madden is open to more Firefly if Whedon is.

While at the panel at last month's TCA 2017, Madden told Rotten Tomatoes that he's open for a Firefly reboot (via TV Overmind). but Madden only wants it if Whedon is involved. It would be awesome to see fresher episodes of this beloved sci-fi western franchise, and I'm sure its former cast members would be open to reunite in a new show, but the Avengers: Age of Ultron director is currently busy making films.

After Age of Ultron was released in theaters, Whedon told Collider: ""there are rights [issues] between Fox and Universal because one had the show and one had the movie, so it gets a little funky fresh with that.""

Achieved 100% ScreenTest score. ,http://hellogiggles.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-perfect-score/,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" just did something no other Marvel movie has done before

Just when you thought you couldn’t get more excited for the next installment of Marvel’s Guardians franchise, there’s more good news. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 got a perfect score in a test screening — which is, so far, the highest score a Marvel movie has ever snagged. That’s just downright the highest score any film can snag.

Now hold up, what’s a test screening? Test screenings are early screenings shown to audiences to get an idea of how the film will perform. Even Iron Man 3 and Avengers only got scores in the 90s out of 100. But Vol. 2 walked away will a 100. You know Baby Groot is excited.

The film won’t hit theaters until May 5th but after the success of the first Guardians of the Galaxy and the continued success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films in general, it feels like the pressure is mounting on each film to be better than the ones before. So a high audience testing score is certainly a reason to celebrate! Although, according to Deadline, Marvel uses mostly friends and family for their test screenings in order to prevent leaks. Of course, that could result in higher scores than random people.

Director James Gunn has been posting lots of fun behind-the-scenes photos on his Instagram account which has only increased anticipation for the film. It looks epic.

Audiences are certainly excited about the film as well tweeting their excitement every time a new image, teaser, or tidbit of information is released.

",https://www.avclub.com/article/it-took-more-ian-mcshane-and-prayer-get-american-g-254290,"The All-Father uses emoji. “This is the first time I’m saying this in an interview,” American Gods co-showrunner Michael Green divulges when talking with The A.V. Club last week. “Ian McShane: He makes fun of Instagram, Twitter. ‘Oh, that social thing I leave that to you’—he will text with emojis and GIFs. It means we’re in a world where we all have a much more complicated relationship with technology.”

That’s surprising news from an actor who joked with The A.V. Club about turning his back on modern technology, and even more notable considering the character he plays in Green’s series represents the world before gadgets and smiley-face icons. American Gods casts McShane as Mr. Wednesday, a.k.a. All-Father, a.k.a. the Norse deity Odin. He’s the leader of a group of old gods now moored in the U.S. and prepping for war against the new ones, whose ranks include physical manifestations of present-day obsessions like, yes, technology. The old gods are representative of the legends people brought with them when they came to America; the new ones are what we’ve become consumed by. When the novel by Neil Gaiman came out in 2001, emoji weren’t part of the cultural dialogue. Now the already acclaimed adaptation is set to debut in a much different landscape, one in which an eggplant can be used to convey something dirty and stories about immigration are inherently political. But when or how it was going to be adapted wasn’t always a given.

American Gods isn’t an easily contained or explained narrative. It’s a sprawling, complicated epic that centers on Shadow (Ricky Whittle), who, just out of prison, is hired (or, perhaps more accurately, is coerced) into working for Wednesday after discovering that Shadow’s wife, Laura (Emily Browning), has died in a car crash while having an affair with his best friend, Robbie (Dane Cook). Along the way the new gods like Media (Gillian Anderson) try to woo Shadow to join their side or threaten him. And all the while Gaiman weaves historical tales of how these deities wound up in the country. Remove the fantasy elements, and the show’s about how this nation was built on the many faiths of countless people who traveled from far away to get here.

For Gaiman, the process of getting American Gods to the screen wasn’t a particularly lengthy one. (The author reserves that designation for the constantly in-flux movie based on his comic The Sandman.) Throughout the years, he fielded offers from filmmakers intrigued by the text but baffled by how to translate it. “I write a book, it’s obviously unfilmable,” he says. “I do not worry about the fact that it’s unfilmable. Because I’m writing an unfilmable book, I have a great time with that. So people phone me up and say, ‘Hello, I am a famous director that you have heard of. I just read your book. I think it would make an amazing movie, but how would you make this into a movie?’ And I say, ‘I don’t know.’ I say, ‘Honestly, I think at the point where you make it a 120-page script, you’ve thrown away anything that makes it interesting,’ and so nothing ever happened.”

In 2011, however, he joined forces with Tom Hanks’ production company, Playtone, to develop an American Gods series for HBO. News that the project was underway broke just before HBO launched a different fantasy property: Game Of Thrones. “By the time we’d handed our script in, our nice, smart exec had gone, and the people remaining were going, ‘We don’t really know what it is, and we don’t really understand it, and we don’t like it that much,’” Gaiman said. “So we did two drafts and a polish, and they gave us the rights back.” The author explains he was “relieved” when HBO got out of the picture, which ultimately led him to Starz and Bryan Fuller, the creator of visually marvelous worlds ranging from the whimsical (Pushing Daisies) to the nightmarish (Hannibal). What sold Gaiman on Fuller was not that he had a vision for tackling the challenging material immediately in mind, but that he loved the book. Fuller remembers Gaiman coming to visit him in Toronto; when he was asked if he wanted to do it, he said yes—with Michael Green, creator of the biblical-themed and short-lived NBC series Kings, which starred McShane. These days, Green is racking up blockbuster credits like the acclaimed Wolverine movie Logan, the Blade Runner sequel, and the new Murder On The Orient Express.

The producers and cast acknowledge that they did not have any easy task ahead of them. Actor Pablo Schreiber—who plays the tall, nasty leprechaun Mad Sweeney—says he was initially perplexed by how it was all going to come together. “I was just blown away by the world,” he recalls. “I was like, ‘What is this magical piece of writing?’ And so crazy, like how is this a TV show? How does it work? Then, after getting the job, I went back and read the book, and it started to make a little more sense, although I still couldn’t really imagine how it was going to be a TV show.”

Even before he took on the part of old god Mr. Nancy, Gaiman’s version of the folkloric arachnid Anansi, Orlando Jones had affection for what Gaiman had put on the page. “The core principle obviously is you can manifest your thoughts into realities if you believe,” he says. “An interesting and powerful concept but a difficult visual to realize.”

Green and Fuller came to the concept as fans, but that doesn’t mean they were 100 percent faithful. “We wanted to recreate our experience, and by definition that’s going to be our experience as a reader, which is going to be different from yours or anyone else’s,” Green said. “But we could also reassess our own experience reading it. Especially in those first three episodes where we were adapting parts of the book that are very great, tight story and offer a very strong point of view. We also knew we wanted to sow the seeds for the later orchard of other points of view and other tonal diversions.”

Whittle didn’t finish reading American Gods until filming for season one was complete, because Green and Fuller stopped him, eager to create a unique version of Shadow. “They straight-up said, ‘Stop reading the book because it’s affecting your performance, and that’s not the character we want for TV,’” he says. “You don’t want a man who thinks every week. Shadow was very blasé and quiet in the book, and that’s just not going to work for the adaption. We needed him to kind of fight, and more friction with Mr. Wednesday.”

But perhaps the most notable change to the story involves fleshing out Laura’s backstory and her own plot. (Per Schreiber, Laura and Mad Sweeney eventually get their own road trip. It was pitched to him as: “Bonnie And Clyde with a zombie and leprechaun.”) The fourth hour establishes her complicated persona, and Fuller considers it “perfect hybridization” of his and Green’s styles. For Green, it’s indicative of how their ideas can mesh seamlessly with the source material. “It’s fan fiction that works its way into the new author’s preferred text,” he says.

Indeed, to Gaiman the series is a collaborative effort between himself and the pair, who will call and email him with questions. He points out details from the original that he knows will be important to the sequel that he’s writing, and puts his foot down when he believes they have misconstrued a character’s intentions. (However, he found his biggest demand—that the diversity of the characters and the cast be kept intact—was a non-issue for both the showrunners and Starz.)

And the show may yet have some impact on what Gaiman produces in the future. “Were I ever to write Wednesday again, he would probably sound a lot more in my head like Ian McShane, because listening to Ian deliver those lines is like, ‘Oh, that is the best they could ever be delivered,’” he says. But will he share McShane’s penchant for emoji?",It took more than Ian McShane and a prayer to get American Gods to your TV

It was a flag that barely tapped her. ,http://variety.com/2017/film/news/moana-hit-in-head-how-far-ill-go-oscars-aulii-cravalho-1201995814/,"The voices behind the characters of “Moana” livened the Oscar stage on Sunday night, with “Moana” actress Auli’i Cravalho and one of the film’s music writers, Lin-Manuel Miranda, performing the Academy Award-nominated song “How Far I’ll Go.”

Miranda, who Dwayne Johnson introduced as his “twin,” rapped an original prologue before Cravalho, 16, took over singing duties. Dancers — clad in blue attire — brought the film to life on stage, creating an oceanic look with scarves. Despite her vocal prowess, the performance had a hiccup as one of the ribbon twirlers hit Cravalho on the head with her prop. The newcomer — already a pro — barely flinched.

Auili'i Cravalho got hit in the head by a flag and kept going like a champ #Oscars pic.twitter.com/onS3dvCBfY — Variety (@Variety) February 27, 2017

Miranda, the mastermind behind “Hamilton” is competing for best original song — up against other Broadway composers, including Benj Pasek and John Paul, who wrote lyrics to Justin Hurwitz’s music for two of this year’s nominated songs, “City of Stars” and “Audition (The Fools Who Dream)” from “La La Land.” It’s also up against “The Empty Chair” from “Jim: The James Foley Story” and “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” from “Trolls.”

If Miranda takes home the best song award for “How Far I’ll Go,” he’ll earn the elusive EGOT — Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards — and join the even more select group of people who have also won a Pulitzer Prize.

“How Far I’ll Go,” is considered the “I Want” song, a tune typically sung by the main character in Disney animated musicals that describes their dissatisfaction with their current life, and their hopes for a new life in the near future. It’s akin to “Part of Your World” from “The Little Mermaid” and “Just Around the Riverbend” from “Pocahontas.” But “How Far I’ll Go” stretches those boundaries, as Moana sings in longing for personal growth, as a 16-year-old girl who wants to venture out and become better for her own world.",‘Moana’ Star Auli’i Cravalho Gets Hit in the Head While Performing ‘How Far I’ll Go’

Internet troll savEdward gave them a response that was a bit too personal for most people’s taste.

But rather than blowing off the troll’s NSFW response, Samsung instead decided to go for the jugular and hit the man right where it hurts using a single emoji.

And because the savage response could be seen by millions, it wasn’t long before other Twitter users joined the party.

Samsung’s response had many iPhone users preparing to switch over to that Android life.

Pizza. It's literally right in the picture. ,http://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a52288/pizza-wedding-cake/,"When Jess Melara and Tony Sanchez were planning their wedding, which took place last December in Miami, they decided to skip the traditional white wedding cake and serve pizza instead.

""Tony and I love pizza and aren't huge fans of cake, so we surprised our guests with Pizza Cake (yes, I said pizza cake!),"" Melara told Wedding Chicks. ""It was saucy and delicious and what pizza dreams are made of.""

Here is their four-tier wedding ""cake"" in all of its cheesy glory:

If you're worried that they missed out on any wedding traditions like picking out a cute cake topper, cutting the first slice or feeding each other a bite, you'll see here from these photos captured by Todd Good Photography that it's possible to do all those fun things with a piece of pizza instead.

We also love how their caterer made the pies more wedding-worthy by adding edible flowers and basil leaves to the tiers. But our favorite detail? These fun boxes they used to serve slices to their guests.

Before any cake-lovers out their totally lose it over the fact that this couple served pizza instead of cake at their wedding (gasp!), you'll be happy to hear that their guests with sweet tooths weren't totally left out. They also hired a food truck to serve nine different flavors of gelato at their reception, and also handed out Cracker Jacks and funfetti cake as favors for everyone to take home.

Best. Wedding. Ever.

"The previous actor, Richard Harris, was homophobic. ",http://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/viral-sir-ian-mckellen-reveals-the-reason-he-turned-down-playing-dumbledore-20170404,"Sadly, we'll never have a quintessential answer to Who'd win in a fight between Gandalf and Dumbledore?""

Firstly, they're both from different worlds, meaning they'd never cross paths. Secondly, Dumbledore is dead and Gandalf sailed away to the Undying Lands. And thirdly, this is all completely fictional.

However, let's get it straight here: If we're talking Gandalf the Grey vs Dumbledore, we're probably looking at Dumbledore just coming out on top. However, if we're talking about Gandalf the White vs Dumbledore, old Albus would be down on his knees begging for mercy within seconds. He just wouldn't stand a chance.

Advert 10

As it turns out, the two wizards could have been the same person.

Following Richard Harris' death in 2002, the role for Dumbledore needed to be filled. By this point Sir Ian McKellen had already cemented himself as Gandalf the Grey in The Fellowship of the Ring, and was awaiting the character's return at the end of the year in The Two Towers.

You'd think that already playing one wizard in a mega film series would be enough of a reason to let Michael Gambon take the role in Harry Potter's world, but there was another, fairly emotional reason.

Speaking on the BBC's HARDtalk the 77-year-old revealed that he was called by the producers of Harry Potter and asked if he'd like a part in the film.

Advert 10

Credit: BBC/HARDtalk

Sadly, he turned it down due to the fact that the deceased Harris, who brought the role to life, allegedly expressed homophobic views.

""When he died - he played Dumbledore, the wizard - I played the real wizard of course - but when they called me up and said would I be interested in being in the Harry Potter films, they didn't say what part,"" openly gay McKellen said on the show. ""I worked out what they were thinking and I couldn't. I couldn't take over the part from an actor who I'd known hadn't approved of me.""

Advert 10

McKellen came out a gay to the general public back in 1988 on a BBC Radio show, and has since been an activist for LGBT rights.

In a statement on his website, he said: ""I have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about - nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.""



The actor is the co-founder of Stonewall, a LGBT rights group, named after the Stonewall riots.



Advert 10

Earlier this year, McKellen and millions of other demonstrators took to the streets for the Women's March in both the USA and the UK.

He was pretty much the star of the show, rocking up to the London march with this amazing sign:

The Women's March in London was the longest I have been on. See the rest of my message attached. pic.twitter.com/q7QC4Jvg0S

- Ian McKellen (@IanMcKellen) January 22, 2017

The sign, which has his best pal Sir Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in his famous face-palm meme pose. Perfect.

Advert 10

Taking to his own Twitter, Sir Ian posted a photo of himself with the Picard placard and this message:

""The Women's March in London was the longest I have been on. Unlike most demonstrations it was not commandeered by any one group with its identical posters.

""The women and their allies had devised their own visual protests, hand-written and improvised at home, expressing their personal reaction to the new President, whose name in schoolyard English means 'to break wind' appropriately.

""The placard of Sir Patrick, by the way, was not my own - I found it at then end of the March in Trafalgar Square. But there were hundreds of others, including the other three here.

""President Breaking Wind has impacted us all; and personally. Some like him, think they can identify with him, believe him because they've seen him on television perhaps and think the billionaire and his billionaire team are truly their friends. The rest of us, including the majority of voters in the USA, see through the charade: after all, the schtick is not exactly subtle. But he's riled us, got under our skin, asking us angry and despairing that he should have got through to the final of his show and turned democracy into a TV/Twitter spectacular.

""What will happen? No doubt his believers will soon be disillusioned. The rest of us cannot let him reign unchallenged. The Marches today were a good beginning. Some who fear him say 'give the man a chance', OK - he's started by removing LGBTQ people, climate change and state funding of the arts from POTUS's website. He's had his chance.""",Sir Ian McKellen Reveals The Reason He Turned Down Playing Dumbledore

",http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/25/marvel-studios-phase-4-untitled-film/,"If there is one thing that Marvel Cinematic Universe does well, it is planning. The huge franchise is well into its third phase right now, and Marvel Studios has features slated to release through 2019. In a few weeks, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will make is debut, and other release dates line the MCU up through May 2019. However, Marvel Studios has been holding onto three premiere dates for untitled projects for some time. And, today, news broke that one of them had been delayed.

Over on Twitter, Exhibitor Relations pushed for the rumormill to begin after one untitled Marvel film had its release date pushed from July 10, 2020 to August 7, 2020. The one-month delay is a not a long one, but it does let fans know Marvel Studios will be aiming for the film to have a late-summer, early-fall premiere.

For now, it is hard to tell which film could take the spot's place. There is always a chance that Marvel Studios may seek out an original series to debut in August 2020. After all, that date follows after Avengers 4, and Kevin Feige has stressed that the MCU will go in a very different direction after the ensemble flick.

Of course, there is also a definite chance that the release date is being set aside for a sequel. 2019 will see Captain Marvel, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, and Avengers 4 hit theaters. It may be that Marvel Studios wants to bring out Doctor Strange 2 or even Guardians of the Galaxy 3 at this time. The former franchise had its first film premiere last fall, so a August 2020 sequel release would give the film fours years to get done. That timeframe seems a bit long for Marvel Studios, so others have speculated the date will be reserved for the next Guardians of the Galaxy film.

"He said it would be ""unfair"" to do so. Instead, he ate a chicken foot. ",http://www.techtimes.com/articles/192443/20170118/carpool-karaoke-did-james-corden-dare-to-reveal-the-worst-singer-ever-video.htm#pt0-712142,"In a recent raucous version of ""Spill Your Guts Or Fill Your Guts"" on CBS' The Late Late Show with James Corden, the talk show host proved that he wasn't afraid to name names when it comes to calling out bad behavior by celebrities. But how did Corden react when game partner Khloe Kardashian dared him to name the worst ""Carpool Karaoke"" guest ever?

The Late Late Show with James Corden Clips And Games

By now, almost everybody knows about the wildly popular ""Carpool Karaoke"" segments on James Corden's late night chat program The Late Late Show. The famous sing along car rides are among the most viewed videos on YouTube, with well over 1 billion views and counting for the 23 segments filmed thus far.

Last year's most viewed viral video of all was Corden's ride with singer Adele, and the show is soon set to become a separate series spinoff on Apple TV, with Corden still on board as a producer, but not as host.

While the ""Carpool Karaoke"" clips may be the most popular from Corden's show, there are a bunch of other regular rotating games and bits on The Late Late Show, one of which is the aptly titled ""Spill Your Guts Or Fill Your Guts."" In the segments, Corden competes against a celebrity guest, as one alternately dares the other to either answer a revealing question or eat a disgusting food.

Corden's Truth Or Dare

This time it was Kardashian sister Khloe in the hot seat. When challenged by Corden, Khloe admitted that her least favorite show on the E! network was Rob And Chyna, starring none other than her brother, but then chose to eat a fish eye rather than tell whether or not she believed ""OJ did it.""

When Khloe asked Corden who was the ""rudest celebrity"", Corden almost balked as he worried that the show might be trying to book the star for an appearance. However, when Kardashian pointed out that if the person was rude, Corden shouldn't even want him on the Late Late Show, Corden admitted it was Pierce Brosnan, who had pushed him at a concert.

Then it came time for the big reveal of another celebrity name when Khloe asked the million-dollar question: Who was the worst singer ever on ""Carpool Karaoke?"" Corden looked pained as he paused and considered whether he'd want to answer, ultimately deciding that it would be ""unfair"" to do so and instead electing to chow down on a chicken foot.

It was clear however, that Corden did have a name in mind, and our money is on Britney Spears, who herself characterized her appearance on ""Carpool Karaoke"" as ""awkward"" in a later interview, in which she called Corden ""the guy,"" confirming Corden's producing partner Ben Winston's suspicions that the ditzy dance diva hadn't even seen ""Carpool Karaoke"" before actually filming it.

Leonard never wears lenses in his glasses. ,https://www.yahoo.com/news/something-big-bang-theory-never-220622002.html,"There’s something in “The Big Bang Theory” we never noticed this ENTIRE time

This is going to blow your mind, because the one mad obvious thing you’ve never noticed on The Big Bang Theory has been right in front of our faces this whole time…or should we say in front of Leonard’s face. We take for granted that the characters on The Big Bang Theory are our fellow nerds, ’cause they mostly are, but we’re here to expose Dr. Leonard Hofstadter for the FRAUD that he is. As any person who truly wears glasses knows, it’s a burden to bear, even if they’re SUPER CUTE and in line with your #aesthetic, keeping glasses clean is a lifelong chore.

But not for Leonard — because his glasses aren’t real and don’t have lenses, ya’ll. Yeah, as glasses wearers, we feel betrayed, too.

Look deeeep into his eyes — and you’ll realize that it’s actually quite easy to do because his glasses have no lenses and you can see straight through.

Galecki told the Huffington Post, “We rehearsed the first episode for about a week and a half, and when we started to shoot, they said, ‘Well, you’re gonna take your glasses off, right?’ I said, ‘No, I want Leonard to wear glasses.’ They said, ‘Oh, we just thought you were wearing them as Johnny for rehearsal all week.”

He also said that they had to get rid of the lenses in his glasses for shooting purposes — when he looked up with his regular glasses, the lights caught the lenses and created a glare. WE GET IT, IT’S PRACTICAL.

“I quickly popped out the lenses and that’s the movie magic behind that,” Galecki stated.

And obviously Galecki has run into problems on set. It must be weird to wear glasses with no lenses and act like nothing is wrong. In fact, the actor told HuffPo that he’s accidentally poked through the frame and ended up scratching his eye (which, ouch). “That kind of killed the moment,” said Galecki. We bet!

Story continues

But we can’t help but feel a liiiiitle betrayed by one of our favorite nerds. We still love you, Leonard, but we’d love you better with real glasses. JUST sayin’.

"""I wouldn’t touch those, are you kidding me?” Kennedy said with a laugh. “Those will always remain his."" ",http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/04/24/star-wars-george-lucas-altered-versions-lucasfilm-kathleen-kennedy/,"When George Lucas sold his company and the Star Wars Universe to the Walt Disney Company, fans were rightly worried about how this major change would affect the stories they've loved and cherished for decades.

And despite the Extended Universe stories being swept under a different bubble, no one has much to worry about regarding any other major alterations to the original films, much like what Lucas himself did to the cuts over time.

Speaking with the Steele Wars podcast at Star Wars Celebration last week, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy spoke about the company's commitment to George Lucas' final cuts and that they would not alter the films in any way.

""I wouldn't touch those, are you kidding me?"" Kennedy said with a laugh. ""Those will always remain his.""

This could be taken one of two ways, considering that fans have been clamoring for the unaltered versions of the movies for quite some time. Does this possibly mean that Lucasfilm would be against releasing the original cuts of the film, and that the continuously-modified Special Editions will remain the only versions available?

UP NEXT: Episode IX To Undergo Its First Script Reading Soon

Disney's purchase inspired some hope in fans who have wanted a high definition release of the original cuts—without the CG dance scenes, the extra wompa shots, and the infamous altering of ""Han Shot First""—but there is a wrinkle in that plan due to the original deal with Fox and Lucasfilm.

Fox owns the distribution rights to Star Wars: A New Hope in perpetuity, and their distribution deal for the other episodic films will lapse around 2020 and revert to Disney. So anything done before them is in conjunction with Fox, and Disney probably isn't keen on splitting such a huge money pie with a competitor.

But Kennedy's words also indicate that George Lucas' vision is the only vision, even if it's at different times, and they'd be silly to ignore the demand for a rerelease of the original cuts.

Maybe we just shouldn't expect to see that until 2020 at the earliest.

June 9th. ,http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/orange-is-new-black-season-5-release-date-first-look-973194?facebook_20170208,"[Warning: This story contains spoilers from the fourth season of Orange Is the New Black.]

A storm is coming for the ladies of Litchfield when Orange Is the New Black returns.

Netflix announced Wednesday a date for the highly anticipated return of Jenji Kohan’s prison dramedy. The fifth season of OITNB will premiere June 9.

Along with the release date, the streaming giant unveiled a 15-second teaser for the new season, providing a first glimpse at the collective mood of the orange-clad prisoners after season four’s game-changing tragedy and cliff-hanger finale.

The footage rotates from prisoner to prisoner as Alex (Laura Prepon), Piper (Taylor Schilling), Nicky (Natasha Lyonne), Flaca (Jackie Cruz), Taystee (Danielle Brooks), Lorna (Yael Stone), Cindy (Adrienne C. Moore), Maria (Jessica Pimentel), Red (Kate Mulgrew) and Gloria (Selenis Leyva) are shown running a post-Poussey Washington gamut of emotions, ranging from shock to fear and rage. The teaser ends where season four left off, with Daya (Dascha Polanco) holding the gun that will seemingly initiate a prison-wide riot.

Laverne Cox, though missing from the teaser, also joins the returning castmembers for season five.

After the provocative death of fan-favorite character Poussey (Samira Wiley) — who was accidentally suffocated by Bayley (Alan Aisenberg), a white guard, during a protest — her body was left on the floor for a day and her death was covered up, prompting a grieving Taystee to incite the inmates to riot. Enraged by the abuse at the hands of the new guards, Daya gets a hold of one of the guard’s guns and points it back at him, leaving viewers to wonder if she will pull the trigger and where the timely Netflix dramedy will ricochet come season five.

“It’s war,” Brooks told The Hollywood Reporter when asked about the effect Poussey’s tragic death will have on the upcoming season. “Taystee has nothing to lose, she’s lost everything that she cared so deeply about. It’s time to fight”

Brooks recently revealed the fifth season of 13 episodes will take place over the course of three days, breaking tradition from previous seasons. OITNB has kept the time span of each season vague so as to not specifically address how much time is left on characters’ sentences, and the condensed time span is likely a shift to address the intense fallout after the inmates’ devastating loss.

“It will be very detailed, very intense, and you better get ready,” Brooks added of the season. “Get your popcorn, your tissues.”

The cast of the award-winning series, produced by Lionsgate, recently picked up their third consecutive SAG Award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a comedy series. Ahead of the season-four premiere, OITNB was renewed through season seven, marking the longest commitment of any Netflix original series.",Netflix Reveals Premiere Date for ‘Orange Is the New Black’ Season 5

This isn't the first time Siri has gotten a timely pop culture-inspired update. Apple's assistant is a known fan of Game of Thrones, Back to the Future, Pokémon Go, and a whole bunch of other robot-themed sci-fi movies.

While the Lego Batman update may not be Siri's most memorable pop culture update (or even her best troll) it should be a fun surprise to fans of the movies.

It prevents their feet from swelling and forming blisters. ,https://brightside.me/wonder-curiosities/this-is-why-celebrities-wear-shoes-that-are-too-big-for-them-307860/,"Many of you have probably paid attention to the fact that some celebrities appear on the red carpet wearing shoes that are at least a size too big. Why? Is this a new fashion trend? Or is there more to it? We at Bright Side have decided to figure this out.

In fact, many Hollywood stars deliberately choose to grace the red carpet wearing heels that are too long or too wide for them. They just know a simple secret: by doing so, they will prevent their feet from swelling and forming blisters. After all, celebrities have to wear high heels for hours — sometimes all night. Obviously, their feet will swell.

To avoid foot pain, discomfort, and chronic foot issues later in life, celebrities choose to wear shoes that are at least a size too big for them. Moreover, large pumps or sandals won't rub, pinch, or squeeze because they don't put pressure on the most vulnerable areas of the feet.

To keep shoes that are too large from slipping off the feet at the worst possible moment, stylists just put silicone pads inside the pumps. This simple trick ensures that the shoe fits snugly but stays on the foot, does not restrict blood circulation, and stops feet from swelling.",This Is Why Celebrities Wear Shoes That Are Too Big for Them
If he was put in a film with Deadpool. ,http://comicbook.com/2017/03/03/patrick-stewart-professor-xavier-deadpool-return/,"This weekend, the world will bid goodbye to two iconic members of the X-Men Cinematic Universe. Both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are bowing out of the series after more than a decade on-board. The stars will exit their respective roles as Wolverine and Professor Xavier when Logan hits theaters, and fans are mourning the end of an era. While Jackman had been open about his decision to leave, Stewart's admission had plenty stunned as the actor only confirmed the suspicion last month. However, there is one way the actor could return to his longstanding role.

It's simple; Just put him in a film with Deadpool.

Recently, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman took part in a fan-based interview with MTV. It was there the British actor was asked if he was done with Professor Xavier for good. Here's what Stewart had to say:

""I would have said yes, but the discussion just now about Deadpool makes me think, well, maybe there is a proper justification for the revival of Charles Xavier.""

This isn't the first time Stewart has pitched in support for Ryan Reynold's mouthy mercenary. Last month, the actor said he would love for Professor Xavier to meet Deadpool. ""I would love that. Just set it up,"" Stewart said, even going so far as to ask Jackman to pull enough strings to ensure the meet-up happened.

Hopefully, Professor Xavier won't try too hard to read Deadpool's mind. He may have to scrub his own clean after doing so.

Not long ago, Jackman also confessed he would be interested in playing Wolverine a bit longer under one condition. The actor said he would continue in the role if the grumpy mutant were somehow folded into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, given 20th Century Fox's frosty relationship with Marvel Studios, it does not look like the crossover is likely.

""In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces.""

Logan stars Hugh Jackman (Logan), Boyd Holbrook (Donald Pierce), Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier), Dafne Keen (Laura Kinney/X-23), Doris Morgado (Maria), Stephen Merchant (Caliban), Elizabeth Rodriguez (Gabriela), and Richard E. Grant (Dr. Zander Rice). James Mangold is directing and helped on the screenplay along with Scott Frank and Michael Green.

English Muffins from The Model Bakery. ,http://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Oprah-s-greatest-extravagance-is-from-Napa-and-11078894.php,"When someone with the wealth and popularity of Oprah Winfrey talks about her ""greatest extravagance,"" plenty of things come to mind.

A predilection for seriously expensive vacations, maybe? A love for flipping multi-million dollar homes, à la Ellen DeGeneres, perhaps?

While the talk show host certainly doesn't shy away from luxury trips and pricey real estate, instead Winfrey's greatest extravagance is... apparently available for purchase in St. Helena.

That extravagance? English muffins from The Model Bakery.

""My greatest extravagance is flying in English muffins from Napa Valley,"" Winfrey said in an interview with People Magazine. ""There's a specific English muffin made by these two women at this wonderful bakery in Napa Valley. I know it's not a good carbon footprint to fly in your English muffins but...""

RELATED: Oprah admits she was 'off balance' two years after ending talk show

Winfrey named the English muffins as part of her holiday ""Favorite Things"" list in 2016. In her description of the muffins, Winfrey wrote: ""I don't have to tell you all how much I love bread. These English muffins are my current carb of choice: crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and scrumptious all over—especially when slathered with the amazing Clif Family preserves that are included. Full disclosure: I took a few bags home from the shoot!""

Model Bakery owner Sarah Mitchell confirmed Winfrey's love for the English muffins, telling the Napa Valley Register last year that she had tried it while in wine country.

""Oprah had the chance to taste our English muffins while visiting the Napa Valley earlier this year, and really loved them,"" Mitchell said. ""We've been sending her special orders for a while and were thrilled when we learned that they would be featured as one of her favorite things for 2016.""

While it may seem strange to declare a baked good an ""extravagance,"" consider the fact that a dozen English muffins and a jar of preserves will set you back $40 on the bakery's online store. The muffins are made of a focaccia dough, all hand-shaped by the bakers, then cooked in skillets using clarified butter. In 2013, Model was noted as making about 1,000 English muffins a day, although we wouldn't be surprised if that number has since increased, due to the Oprah Effect.",Oprah Winfrey's 'greatest extravagance' is from Napa (and is not what you'd expect)
Vin Diesel. ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1647049/who-came-up-with-the-idea-of-family-in-the-fast-and-furious-movies-according-to-michelle-rodriguez,"While the idea of family in the Fast and Furious franchise has become something of a running joke in online forums, the fact of the matter is that it is impressive to see how this series has never shied away from that central theme. The last seven films have stayed loyal to that core message, and The Fate of the Furious (which debuts in theaters tomorrow) will seemingly double down on it as the franchise moves forward. So who came up with it? Who was the person who figured out that family would make these films pop? According to franchise star Michelle Rodriguez, it can all be traced back to Dominic Toretto himself -- Vin Diesel. Rodriguez said:

It's something that came out of Vin's mouth when he didn't like the line that was there, and I love how it caught wildfire. At the end of the day the movie is all about that. If you've got no heart to keep together all the blowing up and explosions, nobody really cares

So according to Michelle Rodriguez's recent interview with The Los Angeles Times, we can thank Vin Diesel for the heavy emphasis on family that has carried the Fast and Furious franchise through its good and bad times. Throughout all of the monumental changes that have taken place over the course of this series' existence, and above everything else that has transpired over the course of the last sixteen years, one little ad-lib by Diesel established the idea that anchored the Fast and Furious franchise. From 2001's The Fast and the Furious to Paul Walker's final moments on-screen at the end of Furious 7, that's what it has all been about.

We cannot even begin to stress the importance of family when it comes to the success of this film series. Plenty of other big budget blockbusters have attempted the same level of chaos and carnage accomplished by the Fast and Furious movies, and in all honesty, some franchises have outperformed this series in that regard. However, by keeping the series centered on a simple and (most importantly) universal theme like family, the Fast and Furious films have managed to cast an enormous audience net and maintain a sense of intimacy even when things get chaotic and insane during the car chases.

If you are a newcomer to the world of Fast and Furious movies, then you may not ultimately realize how often that topic gets brought up in conversation during these films. For a lesson in the finer points of family, check out a supercut of Fast and Furious ""family"" moments below to see for yourself:

Knight was with Tupac when he was killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996. Despite the incident happening over 20 years ago the mystery that surrounds his death, as well as a number of bizarre conspiracy theories, has kept people interested in the case.

However, Knight - who is standing trial for a different murder - has opened up about what he saw that evening. He claims that it was in fact he who was the intended target and that his ex-wife and the former Death Row Records security chief are behind the ordering of the shooting.

Thaddeus Culpepper, Knight's attorney, wrote in an affidavit that his client had known for 'many years that Reggie Wright Jr and his ex-wife, Sharitha, were behind the murder of Tupac and attempted murder of Knight'.

He killed all the main characters. ,http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/03/19/rogue-one-writer-cant-believe-what-disney-let-him-get-away-with/,"As the first spinoff film in the Star Wars Universe, Rogue One was expected to take some risks. But the film's writer couldn't believe just what Lucasfilm let the production get away with.

Speaking with our ComicBook.com's Patrick Cavanaugh, writer of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story's Gary Whitta said he always thought the cast of characters in the film would have to die by the movie's end.

""I never believed that they would let us kill off all the characters in the film,"" Whitta said. ""That was our original instinct. The very first meeting with Gareth I remember saying, 'I kind of feel like they all need to die, but there's no way Lucas ... There's no way Disney'll let us do that. We can't kill everybody. It's a Disney movie.' And yet, they were fully supportive of it, and it's actually one of the coolest things about the film.""

Rogue One chronicles the journey of a ragtag group of Rebels who band together in an effort of recovering the Death Star's plans, in which there's one crucial flaw to be exploited planted within by the superweapon's creator.

The crew ultimately sacrifices their own lives so that the plans can get into the hands of Princess Leia and her cohorts, leading directly into the first Star Wars film released 40 years ago.

UP NEXT: Why Fans Will Never See Its Opening Crawl

""It's one of the thing that I hear the most is that last 20 minutes when you've got all these characters are basically going to make the ultimate sacrifice,"" Whitta said. ""It's the biggest kind of emotional punch that I think the movie has. I'm so glad that they supported that decision.""

Whitta elaborated that there was an enormous pressure from day one—not from Lucasfilm or Disney, but from himself. He said that he and Gareth Evans were determined not to be responsible for being the ones who ""screwed up Star Wars.""

""It took us awhile to get to grips with what it really meant to do a standalone film, but then once we understood it, we realized that it's actually really liberating,"" Whitta said. ""These characters are kind of one and done characters. There was never going to be a Rogue Two. Rogue Two already exists. That's what the original Star Wars is, and those characters aren't in it apart from Leia and Vader, and so we knew that we, now didn't necessarily mean that we had to, but it meant we had the luxury to, you know, we had the full spectrum of options in terms of what the fate of these characters were.""

He added that their deaths wasn't in the first draft of the story because they didn't think Lucasfilm or Disney would allow it, possibly leaving main character Jyn Erso on the table to appear in a future film.

""We always felt that it was the right thing to do, that these characters make the ultimate sacrifice,"" Whitta said. ""It wasn't that way in my original script, but again, we never felt that we would get away with it. K-2 always died, but Jyn survived in the very first version of the movie that we developed, and then it was Gareth who kept pushing for it, saying, 'I feel like they need to die. They need to die.' Eventually he convinced [Disney and Lucasfilm].""

Ultimately, the film benefitted from having a sense of finality in the greater, ongoing Star Wars saga.

""We kind of went back to that original idea of these characters, you know, it was kind of okay that they died, because they completed the mission,"" Whitta said. ""They die so that the whole Star Wars franchise can live, basically.""

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story hits digital HD on March 24. The film will then be released on Blu-ray and DVD April 4.

",http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/18/marvel-unveils-first-look-at-brie-larson-as-captain-marvel/,"Marvel Studios invited select members of the press to tour their offices on the Disney lots in Burbank, California on Monday afternoon.

During the tour, several new looks at films and characters coming up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were unveiled, including Taika Waititi's portrayal of Korg in Thor: Ragnarok, but none were more exciting than the first female hero who will get her own film.

On display in one of Marvel Studios' offices was a trio of concept art photos showcasing Larson in costume as Captain Marvel.

The costume was pulled straight from the pages of Marvel Comics. The most notable difference is the downplaying of the yellow which grabs the eye of those looking at Carol Danver's constume. Instead, it is a much lighter yellow, which can appear to be white at a glance. Otherwise, the suit on the cover of Kelly Sue Deconnick's Captain Marvel #1 is a quite accurate representation of what fans can expect to see in live action.

Artist Andy Park did point out that the costume is still evolving and Larson has not yet tried on the design featured in the concept art images.

Beneath the pair of images which simply showed Larson in costume as Captain Marvel was a design of the character fighting a handful of mech-type enemies in city streets. The enemies had purple eyes, one pair of which were shooting lasers in the background, but Captain Marvel used only one hand to keep the immediate threat's attempted punch away from her -- and was making it look easy.

As for whether or not those images will be released online any time soon, it doesn't sound like it. Larson will make her debut as Captain Marvel in Avengers: Infinity War which is deep into production but Marvel Studios is looking to keep the focus on the four remaining films prior to the ensemble: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor: Ragnarok, and Black Panther.

Top Chef's Shirley Chung and Brooke Williamson Reveal What They Eat When They're at Home

The life of a Top Chef alum seems like it's a nonstop food-fest all day, every day—cooking and tasting the best of the best, traveling the world, and getting wined and dined everywhere you go. We can imagine all that excess takes its toll. So when Top Chef Season 14 winner Brooke Williamson eats at home, she tries to stay healthy.

""I don't eat a lot of dairy, I don't eat a lot of processed food,"" the Los Angeles-based chef said, explaining that she travels a lot—and when she travels, she indulges herself. ""So when I go home, I feel like that's my time to kind of collect myself and clean out,"" she explained.

In fact Brooke, who owns four restaurants in LA along with a store selling culinary goods, recently completed the trendy Whole30 diet and gave up drinking alcohol for a month. ""And I felt great! So I kind of wanted to continue it,"" she said, adding with an eye-roll: ""And then I came to New York.""

Top Chef Season 14 first runner-up Shirley Chung also likes to stay healthy when she's not traveling or working. ""I cook a lot of Italian and Chinese food at home, so it's always balanced with lots of vegetables, a little bit of protein, and some starch. Naturally, I don't eat a lot of dairy…and I love vegetables,"" she said.

Shirley is hard at work on her new restaurant, a casual spot called Steamers Co., which she plans to open in downtown LA. She's partnered up with her husband (who will be working the front of the house) to serve up simple, healthy bowls of steamed seafood.

Keeping it healthy at home, however, isn't always easy. Shirley said she tries to avoid carbs, but ""I cannot stay away from rice, noodles, or soy sauce,"" she declared. ""So there's no way I could do [Brooke's] Whole30.""

The Whole30 program bans ingredients like sugar, grains, dairy, and legumes—including all forms of soy. Meat, seafood, veggies, some fruit, and good fats are allowed.

Bella Thorne Ditches Her Red Hair For Something Much More Dramatic

Bella Thorne is trying something different from her trademark fiery red hair. On Wednesday (December 28), she shared a video of herself with her tresses dyed a deep navy ombré — a pitch-black color that bleeds into midnight blue.

The Disney Channel alum revealed her new 'do on Snapchat, where she snapped every step of the dyeing process. This included her jamming out to Lil Aaron and Futuristic while waiting for the dye to set. She shares so much of her life with fans that it's no surprise she documented the whole experience on social media.

Before this, Thorne rocked neon red and yellow hair with her older sister, Dani. Then they both dyed the tips of their hair rainbow two weeks ago. Now Bella's gone blue (da ba dee da ba die).

“It was such an amazing experience and people don’t know this about me, but I’m really shy in a lot of ways,” Rose told host Tom Bergeron after she was ousted. “I think that showed on the ballroom floor. I tried my best.”

It was obvious during the rehearsal package that the competition was weighing heavy on Rose, who walked out on Chmerkovskiy after he lost his cool and punched the mirror when she wasn’t following his direction.

“You just did everything super perfect, you are not going home. You are going from the beginning to the end,” he protested as she began to cry. “If you’re done, then we are not going to be ready. Amber, I’m not going to let you go. You have to do it for you, you have to do it for me.”

She bugged out, anyway.

The duo clearly rallied on Monday, but their Cha Cha — performed to “Bla Bla Bla Cha Cha Cha” by Petty Booka — only earned 28 out of a possible 40. So long, gal!

The night’s biggest highlight was a very moist Argentine Tango performed by Jana Kramer and Gleb Savchenko. Dancing to Selena Gomez’ “Hands to Myself,” the duo borrowed a page from Flashdance and performed half of the dance while soaked.

“Now that is chemistry!” exclaimed judge Julianne Hough. “You set the record for the hottest Argentine Tango.”

“Pulsating with lust!” added judge Bruno Tonioli. “Driven by unsatiable desire!”",DWTS: And the latest celebrity to leave is...
"Because he needed somewhere with privacy, Tyson Chandler couldn't get into his rooftop pool since it was 3am, and the bathtub was made for someone 7ft tall and therefore large enough to accommodate Bieber. #StopClickbait",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carl-lentz-justin-bieber-baptism_us_57fec80fe4b05eff55817389?ir=Entertainment,"When Justin Bieber was in the midst of what’s been described as a public downward spiral, he turned to someone in particular for help: Jesus. And Carl Lentz.

As the lead pastor at Hillsong Church in Manhattan, Lentz has become known as the “rockstar pastor,” counseling celebrities on matters of faith when he’s not leading his come-as-you-are congregation. Lentz began talking to Bieber after an introduction from a West Coast pastor, Judah Smith, and that’s when Lentz learned of Bieber’s interest in baptism.

“The choices he had made ― he got to a place where he was like, ‘I want to start fresh.’” Lentz says.

Lentz speaks with Oprah about Bieber’s baptism on this weekend’s “SuperSoul Sunday,” where he details the story from beginning to end. When Bieber and Lentz first discussed baptism, Lentz says he explained its intention as “an outward sign of what God’s doing inward.” This resonated strongly with the singer, who Lentz says was ready to commit himself to Jesus in a way that he hadn’t done before.

“He has had a relationship with Jesus, and his mom did a great job doing her best to plant the right seeds. But you can get to a point as a man where it goes from being your mama’s relationship ... to yours,” Lentz says.

However, with the paparazzi constantly following Bieber’s every move, finding the peace and privacy for a baptism was an ongoing challenge.

“We went to four different places,” Lentz says. “I finally called my buddy Tyson Chandler.”

Chandler, a professional basketball player living in New York at the time, received the phone call from Lentz around 3 a.m. “I’m like, ‘Yeah, I need to borrow your [rooftop] pool,’” Lentz says. “He’s like, ‘I can’t get into the pool, but come and use my bathtub.’”

Since he is over 7 feet tall, Chandler’s tub was specially made to accommodate a man of his stature and would be large enough to baptize Bieber, who stands at 5’9”. Despite it being the wee hours of the morning, Lentz describes the whole scene as relatively normal. “Kim Chandler, Tyson’s wife, had some food out,” Lentz says. “This is like regular stuff for our type of church.”

The baptism itself, he adds, was anything but “regular.”

“It was probably one of the most special things I’ve been a part of,” Lentz says.

In one of the biggest revelations from the books, J.K. Rowling writes that Lupin's werewolf condition is a metaphor for illnesses that carry a stigma.

In a section of Short Stories From Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies, J.K. Rowling details the life of Remus Lupin, from childhood until his untimely death at the hands of Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. Lupin — who Rowling calls ""one of her favourite characters in the entire Potter series"" — was, of course, a werewolf. And according to the author, his lycanthropy is a metaphor for illnesses that exist in the Muggle world.

""Lupin's condition of lycanthropy was a metaphor for those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS,"" Rowling writes. ""All kinds of superstitions seem to surround blood-borne conditions, probably due to taboos surrounding blood itself. The wizarding community is as prone to hysteria and prejudice as the Muggle one, and the character of Lupin gave me a chance to examine those attitudes.""

Remus Lupin alienated himself from the world because of his condition. He became a werewolf on his fifth birthday, as detailed in the short story about his life found in Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies, as well as on Pottermore. Remus's father, Lyall Lupin, encountered a werewolf, Fenrir Greyback, during his time working for the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. He knew Greyback to be a werewolf upon sight, but the other members of the Ministry did not believe him. They teased Lyall, who grew angry and described werewolves as ""soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death."" Greyback heard these comments, and when the Ministry released him from custody, he plotted his revenge again Lyall Lupin. The werewolf journeyed to the Lupin's house, opened Remus' window and attacked the boy. Because the Greyback bit him in his wolfish form during the full moon, Remus was infected.

Lyall greatly regretted what he had said about werewolves. His son was the same as always — he wasn't evil or soulless, but clever and kind and smart. Still, Lyall decided to keep his son's condition a secret. The family moved constantly, upending their lives each time someone caught wind of the situation. ""Remus was not allowed to play with other children, in case he let slip the truth of his condition,"" Rowling writes. ""In consequence, and in spite of his loving parents, he was a very lonely boy.""

His loneliness persisted, until one day a wizard named Albus Dumbledore arrived on his parents' doorstep and invited him to attend Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, he made true friends — James Potter and Sirius Black — who learned his secret and loved him unconditionally. After their death, he returned to his solitary ways, but he eventually found a home with his family, Tonks and Teddy.

In a separate section of the book, Rowling details the difficulties of living with lycanthropy. She doesn't discount the challenges of his condition, but she emphasizes that he lived an amazing life despite the difficulties— he had a wife, a son, wonderful friends, and a mission. We know, of course, how his story ends. Though his life was hard and much too short, he lived it brilliantly.

Mandy Moore has a tattoo of what on her foot?

The ""Candy"" singer revealed the story behind her not-so-sweet tattoo when she made an appearance on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers"" on Monday night.

""About ten years ago, I was on tour with my band...when you go city to city you're on a bus, but you get a day room [in a hotel],” Moore told Meyers. ""I was the only girl, so I had my own room to shower and all the guys in my band shared a room.""

And it appears the boys had only one rule when it came to shower etiquette: No masturbating.

“It became this big joke, because one of my band members was like, 'I don't want babies on my feet,'"" Moore explained. ""And so we created a song called ""Babies on My Feet"" that we sang on stage every night. No one had any idea what we were talking about.""

Indeed, there's video evidence of Moore performing the unusual ditty from back in the day (above), but the band decided to take the inside joke one (permanent) step further by getting tattoos referencing the funny phrase.

",http://nypost.com/2016/08/08/you-wont-believe-why-espn-said-they-hired-jordan-rodgers/,"Jordan Rodgers didn’t just win JoJo Fletcher’s heart on “The Bachelorette.” He got his dream job, too.

The former Vanderbilt quarterback is set to appear on the SEC Network as a college football analyst this season, and an ESPN executive says Rodgers earned the role on his talent alone.

“Our talent office had Jordan on their radar for some time. His name was in the initial group of names that we discussed when looking at people to bring to Charlotte [where the SEC Network is located] for auditions,” Senior V.P. Stephanie Druley told SI.com. “He played at Vanderbilt. He played quarterback. We had seen some interviews that he had done. So we reached out to him.”

Rodgers was unavailable for an audition at the time. Druley claims the network didn’t know what show he was shooting that kept him away, though ABC and ESPN are both owned by Disney. When Aaron Rodgers’ youngest brother finally had his audition, he blew Druley away.

“It was clear he had a real passion and a deep knowledge of college football. The audition was really good — rare that someone walks in off the street and does an audition that we would be willing to air,” she said.

After Rodgers emerged as a front-runner on “The Bachelorette,” ESPN made him an offer a few weeks into the season.

“I had a real concern with how he would be viewed by fans of the show and what it might mean for him down the line,” Druley said. “He accepted the offer the day I was in an airport and saw Us Weekly with him splashed across the cover. Thankfully, the article didn’t live up to the headline, nor did a lot of the other ones I read.”

Rodgers has battled rumors he joined “The Bachelorette” for camera time instead of finding love. Though he and Fletcher are still engaged, his on-screen nemesis, Chad Johnson, called out Rodgers for using fame to his advantage.

Rodgers talked about his professional endeavors during a conference call with reporters last week.

“I’ve been doing broadcasting for the past year — doing radio for ESPN and doing some TV stuff here and there — and I’ll be working with ESPN and SEC Network as a college football analyst,” Rodgers said. “That’s the conference I played in.

",http://www.nasdaq.com/article/youll-never-guess-how-much-money-the-marvel-universe-has-grossed-cm670369,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe, or (MCU) is a shared fictional universe focused on a series of superhero films that are based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics. In addition to feature films, it also includes comic books, short films, and television series. Films in the MCU have been split into three distinct phases.

It was acquired back in 2009 by the Walt Disney Co. DIS for $4 billion. Many were worried that the deal would both ruin beloved Marvel characters like Iron Man and damage Disney's financial standing and stock valuation. Fast forward to 2016, and Disney's acquisition could very well be one of the best things to happen to both the media giant and the comic book publisher.

However, it looks like the MCU is quickly coming to an end, at least as we know it. In an interview with IGN , Anthony Russo-who will be directing the upcoming Avengers films with his brother Joe-said that ""these two movies are intended to be the culmination of everything that has happened in the MCU since the very first Iron Man movie…In being a culmination, these movies are in some ways going to be an end to certain things, and in some ways, they're going to be the beginning of certain things.""

With this in mind, how much money has Marvel grossed at the total worldwide box office? And how much more can it bring in? Let's break it down:

Phase One

Iron Man - $585,174,222

The Incredible Hulk - $263,427,551

Iron Man 2 , bringing in $623,933,331

Thor - $449,326,618

Captain America: The First Avenger - $370,569,774

The Avengers - $1,518,594,910

Phase Two

Iron Man 3 - $1,518,594,910

Thor: The Dark World - $644,783,140

Captain America: The Winter Soldier - $714,121,534

Guardians of the Galaxy - $774,176,600

Avengers: Age of Ultron - $1,398,858,115

Ant-Man - $518,585,201

Phase Three

Phase three is just in its beginning stage, but will wrap up by 2019. The first of the last 10 films of the MCU, Captain America: Civil War , brought in almost $1.5 billion worldwide during its theatrical release.

Audiences can look forward to Doctor Strange hitting theaters this fall; Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , Spider-Man: Homecoming , and Thor: Ragnarok debuting in 2017; Black Panther , Avengers: Infinity War , and Ant-Man and the Wasp premiering in 2018; and Captain Marvel and the untitled Avengers sequel coming to theaters in 2019.

The Marvel Effect

As of now, the MCU has grossed $10,527,843,932 at the box office, and if the next nine films can live up to each of their respective predecessors, the franchise could very well double, and even triple, its worldwide earnings. Both of the next Avengers films could easily make $1 billion each, and if the next Guardians , Thor , and Ant-Man movies follow in common sequel fashion, they could all make well over their originals' total earnings.

Predicting gross profit from films is difficult, as Hollywood accounting is notoriously complicated, but it is safe to argue that Marvel has proven to be the ultimate money maker. Its films, comics, TV shows, merchandise, and all other revenue sources show that Disney made the entertainment deal of a lifetime.

Click here for 12 new Disney World attractions opening in 2016.

Walt Disney first built the park in 1971 as a supplement to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which the animation legend had opened 16 years earlier, on July 17, 1955. However, Orlando wasn’t the initial location that Walt considered for his second park. Plans had actually been drawn up in 1963 for an indoor theme park that was to be built in downtown St. Louis.

Click here for the best restaurants at Disneyland Park.

At the time, it made a lot of sense. Research showed that only five percent of Disneyland’s guests traveled from east of the Mississippi River, despite the fact that 75 percent of America’s population lived on that side of the country — and Walt desperately wanted the extra business. When the plans were drawn up, St. Louis was booming, the landmark Gateway Arch in St. Louis was under construction (it debuted in 1965), and Busch Stadium (est. 1966) was being built just a few blocks away.

However, the would-be Missouri Disney World hit a few roadblocks. Anheuser-Busch beer baron August A. Busch Jr. (who ran much of the city) allegedly insisted that the theme park sell beer, which Walt refused to do in the name of a family-friendly environment. Additionally, Disney was only willing to pay for the rides and attractions, hoping St. Louis’ redevelopment corporation would pay for the building that was to house them. The corporation balked at the idea, and Disney officially scrapped his plans in 1965.

According to 13 pages of blueprints that went to auction late last year, the plans for the St. Louis park included rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad — all of which are now fixtures at the Florida park.

At least in Pennsylvania. The state legislature there recently extended its 6 percent sales tax to digital downloads and subscription services like Netflix and Hulu.

Though it's called the Netflix tax, colloquially at least, the fee will also apply to streaming and downloads for music, e-books and apps. Digital versions of newspapers, magazines and the Bible, will be exempt.

Pennsylvania joins a select group of locations that have begun to put local taxes on digital services. Chicago already has a similar 9-percent tax, often called its ""cloud tax."" Digital goods are also taxable in Minnesota. Similar taxes have come up in Canada. Netflix even battled in Kentucky over telecommunications taxes there, a way some states have tried to tax digital services without imposing a sales tax.

The sales taxes, like the one in Pennsylvania, are applied when a customer uses a billing address in a city or state with an applicable sales tax.

So if you want to avoid the Netflix tax, borrow a billing address outside the state. At least until the Netflix tax comes for us all, that is.

When and how to tax consumers buying services and goods from internet companies has long been a difficult question to answer. Amazon avoided charging sales tax for years before starting to charge it in some locations. Amazon now collects sales tax in 28 states.

The director has a history was going over budget - and film schedules - with his 2012 retelling of The Great Gatsby going significantly over budget.

Similarly to the Gatsby, Luhrmann went through numerous script writers for The Get Down, and according to Variety, ""two showrunners and every inch of the patience among executives at Sony Pictures Television.""

Despite this, the show, that chronicles funk music in the Bronx during the 1970s, has already received some decent reviews.

Indewire have called it Luhrmann’s best work since Moulin Rouge while The Hollywood Reporter have said the series thrives when Luhrmann’s influence becomes less evident.

“(Luhrmann’s) excesses work best in specific environments (Moulin Rouge) and less effectively in others (Australia, The Great Gatsby),” they wrote.

For Cameron Douglass, that goes double.

His dad is, of course, Michael Douglass, whose own dad is film legend Kirk Douglass.

Cameron has spent the last seven years or so in prison on drug charges (waste of resources if you ask us, but that’s for another post), and he’s spending his newfound freedom as anyone would — Instagramming!

Matt Damon has a new movie coming out this weekend, which means that once more, he’s set to do press with his arch nemesis: ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel. Damon and Kimmel, of course, aren’t real enemies; their faux feud goes way back to the early days of Jimmy Kimmel Live, when Kimmel decided on the spur of the moment that it would be funny to pretend to bump Matt Damon from his lineup; years later, Damon mock-reamed out the host when appearing on Kimmel for the first time in 2006. Their pretend bad blood has been a running gag ever since. (There are plenty of timelines on the Internet that go into excruciating detail of every parry and thrust in that made-up feud; E! has a good crash course.)

A decade later—and a full seven years since the feud truly climaxed with Sarah Silverman's “I’m Fucking Matt Damon”—there’s evidence that even Damon and Kimmel may be growing weary of their elaborate mutual vendetta. For proof, just watch the video above from Monday’s edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live, which is more of a “Kimmel vs. Damon” greatest hits montage than it is a new entry in the canon. Even the premise isn’t original; it finds the movie star and the comedian going to couples therapy, a gag they first explored just nine months ago:

That older clip, co-starring Dr. Phil, has over 5.5 million views on YouTube—indicating that there’s life within this old joke yet. But the new sketch—an 8.5-minute pre-taped bit that unfolds in a steady deadpan, with long, laugh-free stretches where you can almost hear the audience squinting and wondering when the jokes are coming—shows that both injured parties may be ready to bury the phony hatchet. That’s especially true in the bit’s ending, in which Damon and Kimmel turn to art therapy to work through their feelings.

Damon draws a picture of Kimmel with a butt for a face; Kimmel, predictably, draws a penis. Unpredictably, the image is enough to make Damon crack up—breaking character in a way that’s pretty much unprecedented for these sketches. Before long, Kimmel joins in; only their fake therapist keeps his composure. Maybe this means both men have finally decided to give up the pretense of pretending to fight. And if that’s the case, they’ve had more than a good run.

"Hank Azaria debunks the fan theory that Moe goes along with Bart's prank calls.

",http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_579f3671e4b0e2e15eb642e3,"""The Simpsons""

On the very first day of this year, Jan. 1, 2016, a new “Simpsons” fan theory emerged that quickly inspired a viral amount of yellow journalism.

As the theory goes, famously cranky bartender Moe Szyslak has actually known all along that Bart Simpson is the notorious prank-caller that’s been bothering his bar since the very first season of the show in 1990.

Advertisement

The Reddit user that proposed the theory, Senor_Schnarf, argued that Szyslak is simply a family friend of the Simpsons and goes along with Bart’s pranks given he’s a lonely man who enjoys making the kid happy.

The most compelling evidence is that Bart’s phone calls to the bar are typically in the same exact voice ― every time ― and follow a beyond obvious joke structure. Szyslak also always goes out of his way to make the joke land.

As an example, in the Season 1 episode “Some Enchanted Evening,” Bart calls Moe’s bar and asks, “Hello, is Al there? ... Al. Last name: Coholic.” In that call, Moe could simply ask if there’s a Mr. Coholic or an Al, but instead yells, “Phone call for Al. Al Coholic. Is there an Al Coholic here?”

The running joke of Bart pranking Moe is one of the show’s most iconic bits. If this theory is true, you would definitely need to go back and re-watch all 27 seasons with the correct interpretations of the two characters to get an accurate understanding of the show. That would take a long time!

So with the opportunity to interview Hank Azaria ―the voice actor behind Moe since Season 1 ― about his recent Emmy nomination for a guest-starring role in “Ray Donovan,” The Huffington Post had to also ask how he felt about the fan theory surrounding his character and Bart.

Well, Azaria doesn’t believe the theory.

""The Simpsons""

Azaria, who voices more characters on “The Simpsons” than any other actor, first reacted to the fan theory by laughing. Then he said, “Uhh, that’s absurd. I never heard that before.”

Not an auspicious start for the theory, but Azaria did do a minor backpedal and said, “Wait, now that I’m thinking about it, he did sort of take a shine to Maggie. And he has often sort of ... ”

Advertisement

Azaria then paused what little credence he was affording the theory and continued, “But no ... I think Moe kind of is what he is. He hates pretty much everyone and has no patience for children.”

The voice actor went on to explain that Moe “is not the brightest bulb in the box” and summed up by saying, “that’s really all the explanation you need,” before laughing again.

To get a final nail to the theory’s coffin, HuffPost pressed on whether Azaria was definitely saying Bart has successfully been tricking Moe this whole time like the show makes it seem on the surface.

“Oh, yeah, I would say for sure,” said Azaria. “That’s how I’ve been playing it.”

"One of the bones identified as the victim's is actually a bird bone.
",https://www.yahoo.com/news/making-murderer-fans-found-more-143032253.html,"making-a-murderer-teresa-halbach-bone-fragments

Netflix

Just because you spent over 10 hours watching the true crime documentary Making A Murderer on Netflix, that doesn’t make you a hardcore fan. That designation is only truly deserved by the scores of obsessed people meticulously going over every transcript and photo from the Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey trials. Internet sleuthing gets a bad rap these days, but it’s hard not to be impressed by the dedication these people have when it comes to figuring out what really happened to murder victim Teresa Halbach.

The latest discovery from this group comes from an analysis of the bone fragments pulled from the fire pit prosecutors accuse Steven Avery of using to burn Halbach’s body. During his trial they claimed his backyard bonfire burned so hot it obliterated her remains, leaving nothing but tiny bone fragment remains without any DNA left. But when fans took a closer look at the ‘human’ fragments collected, one stood out. Property tag 7955 included a bone that is clearly the carpometacarpus of a bird.

making-a-murderer-bird-bone-fragment

Case File

That brings us back to claims from the defense that Avery’s burn pit was regularly used to dispose of deer, rodents, and fowl remains from hunting. How many of the bone fragments collected and attributed to Halbach were just burnt animal remains? It also makes us wonder how a fire could be so powerful it reduced Halbach’s body to small flakes, yet this bird wing bone remained largely intact?

As with many of the key pieces of evidence in the Making A Murderer case, there’s a lot of controversy surrounding the bones found in Steven Avery’s burn pit. A proper forensic grid was never set up, and material from the pit was simply shoveled into boxes and sifted through back at the labs. Record keeping and chain of command protocols were largely ignored by the forensic labs, and the defense in Steven Avery’s trial complained “It is unclear whether some, all, or none of the fragments had been previously determined by the state’s forensic anthropologist to be human or not. In short, the defense has no way of knowing from this cryptic report what was sent to and examined by the FBI Lab.”

Story continues

Case File / Making A Murderer

Steven Avery’s guilt was largely assumed by the public once news reports said Teresa Halbach’s remains were found in his back yard. But that claim, made so persuasively by prosecutor Ken Kratz during Avery’s trial, wasn’t backed up by much science. IDing the remains as Halbach’s was extremely difficult. The best the forensic labs could do was with one bit of tissue that had enough mitochondrial DNA for a test. But that test is supposed to give readings on 16 points of DNA in order to be usable. The lab could only get results on 7. Yet instead of reporting that as ‘inconclusive’, forensic scientist Shelley Culhane claimed the chances the mitochondrial DNA came from anyone other than Halback was “one in a billion.” This statistic is simply wrong — Someone checked out a single small mitochondrial DNA database of 65,000 people and found 122 matches at 9 points.

So you’ve got a single fragment of bone that gave a test result with less than half the required matching points to prove Steven Avery burned Teresa Halbach’s body on his property. That’s not a lot of evidence. Forensics didn’t have much better luck in Stephen Avery’s garage, where prosecutors claim Steven Avery executed Halbach with a hunting rifle. Not a single hint of Halbach’s blood was recovered from that crime scene, although a bullet found there in March (the initial investigation searches were conducted in November) was tested by Culhane, who found Teresa Halbach’s DNA on it. Interestingly enough, the DNA on the bullet was in the form of nucleated cells and not blood, just more ammunition for those who think evidence was planted by investigators.

The rabbit hole goes much deeper on the bones and DNA results, just another aspect of the Making A Murderer case that gets pretty iffy upon closer inspection. That’s one of the reasons people find the show so compelling, and why so many think season two of the documentary will feature Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey being cleared of killing Teresa Halbach. Avery’s lawyer Kathleen Zellner is filing her appeal at the end of August, and it’s guaranteed to blow the lid off this and many other inconsistencies in the case. She’s even said she intends to prove who Halbach’s real killer was as well. We’ll keep you in the know on any further updates on the case.

Australian comedian Jim Jefferies went viral with his impassioned—and hilariously funny—rant about gun control “Guns Are Not Protection” from his 2014 Netflix standup special Bare. The clip’s been viewed millions of times and sadly racks up millions more with every new gun massacre in America.

Well, Jefferies is about to go viral again with this nailed-it-to-the-fucking-wall breakdown of how Donald Trump plans to fight terrorism by profiling Muslims.

The whole thing is fantastic, and you’ll want to watch it all, but the part that I’m talking about specifically starts at the 4:30 mark. After listening to what he says here, how in the world could anyone with even a spoonful of brains think Donald Trump could possibly keep Americans safe from terrorism? Jefferies demolishes that argument. Pulverizes it. Stomps on it. It’s finished. It’s done.

No one who hears this can possibly unhear what he’s saying here. I don’t care how pro-Trump—or stupid—they might be.

No wonder all the ISIL related websites evince such a decidedly pro-Trump slant!

Though the HBO hit has traditionally debuted each new season in April, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss have reportedly revealed we'll have to wait for a later start date in 2017.

Speaking on the ""UFC Unfiltered"" podcast, the minds behind the television adaptation of George RR Martin's novels said,

We don't have an air date yet, but this year will probably be a little bit later.

They continued,

We're starting a bit later because at the end of this season, 'Winter is here' -- and that means that sunny weather doesn't really serve our purposes any more. So we kind of pushed everything down the line, so we could get some grim grey weather even in the sunnier places that we shoot.

",http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2016/jennifer-garner-decides-on-ben-affleck-divorce-to-split-or-reconcile/,"Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, will or won’t they divorce? Tabloids have been speculating for months now on the status of their marriage. The couple have been sending mixed signals to the press and public for almost as long, never providing any affirmative answer.

Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck celebrated their eleventh wedding anniversary this week and it’s been almost a year since they publicized their separation. The couple is still seen together with their children. Case and point, their family trip to London and Paris last month while Ben Affleck was filming Justice League.

Neither Ben nor Jen will confirm or deny the divorce allegations. Ben still calls Jennifer his “wife” as he did during an HBO interview with Bill Simmons last week. Despite his unusual appearance on Any Given Wednesday, Ben Affleck was very clear once more how supportive Jennifer Garner was of him while he rebuilt his career.

But as recent as three weeks ago, Jennifer Garner had plans on divorcing her husband. So does Ben’s HBO appearance mean he still hopes they can reconcile? Does he still believe he can get Jen to come around and change her mind and not finally file divorce papers?

According to an exclusive ET Online report, a source quotes that they are making it work. They also come right out and say that they don’t know if they will ever get a divorce: “They still have not officially filed paperwork for a divorce,” the source reiterates.

ET also noted since their split, the two have established a co-parenting routine with ben remaining close to Jen and the kids.

They’re still legally married, but separated. They both live on their property in Brentwood California. Another source told ET: “They’re in a good place and co-parenting the best they can.”

Confused? ET did it’s best to get to the bottom of this conundrum. Do Ben and Jen know what they’re intensions are? Do they share every relationship up and down with the press and let the tabloids write what they will? Or, do the pair have things worked out and simply tell the press what it wants to hear in order to keep their lives private and press distracted?

Radar Online has an interview with Jennifer’s father after the devastating floods that hit West Virginia. Her dad remains mum about the status of his daughter’s relationship, saying he’d leave it up to the couple to discuss their personal lives.

People Magazine has published two conflicting stories. One friend of Jennifer’s says: “nothing has changed” in the relationship: “They’re still all about putting the kids first.”

Yet another report states that Ben doesn’t want a divorce and Jen has denied to friends that they’ve reconciled. The friend also said that Jen doesn’t mind that the divorce hasn’t been finalized, but she still intends on going through with it.

And to pile on more confusion, the same friend said that Jen really enjoyed her time with Ben and their kids in Europe. She liked spending time with Ben again. And yet another source said: “They have a lot of admiration and respect for each other”

So which is it? Will they or won’t they divorce? Will Ben Affleck and Jen Garner continue to play this game with the press, teasing the tabloids while not really giving them an answer? Or is Jen dangling the reconciliation worm before ben and is ben the one who’s being jerked about?

",http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1529909/when-star-wars-will-finish-filming-according-to-mark-hamill,"There are few franchises that truly inspire heavy fandom the way that Star Wars does. Since A New Hope first flew into theaters, American culture has been absolutely enamored with the galaxy far, far away, and entire generations have united together to watch the space opera and all of the colorful characters which it contains. As such, each new addition to the Star Wars canon is a cultural event, with droves of loyal viewers heading to the movies and attempting (sometimes in vain) to avoid spoilers. And since The Force Awakens was released in December, fans have been eagerly anticipating the next chapter of the main story, the still untitled Episode VIII. Luckily, we just got a little more information regarding the status of the next entry into the galaxy from none other than Luke Skywalker himself.

Mark Hamill has been pretty chatty regarding Episode VIII, most likely because he's actually in this movie for more than two minutes and actually has lines. Hamill most recently took to twitter to reveal when the cast and crew will be wrapping production for the untitled entry into the main canon, and it's real soon. Check it out.

See more

There you go, you scruffy looking nerf herders. Production wraps on the next entry into the saga that is Star Wars in less than a month. So hopefully we'll be able to see some footage or teasers sooner rather than later.

Production wrapping for Episode VIII so soon is seems both exciting and hopeful regarding the overall quality of the mysterious sequel. Since we are not expecting the movie to hit theaters for another year and a half, this gives the producers, editors, and visual effects coordinators plenty of time to really make the film outstanding. The Force Awakens was gorgeous and felt like a chapter from the original trilogy, so Episode VIII will presumably attempt to do the same.

Rather than having to rush to quickly produce a movie for this December, the standalone film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will be released this year. The spinoff will successfully continue the hype and excitement for Star Wars fans, while also allowing post-production for Episode VIII to occur properly.

Squirrel Girl. ,http://comicbook.com/marvel/2016/07/01/anna-kendrick-reveals-the-surprising-marvel-character-that-she-w/,"Everybody wants to be a hero these days. Comedic actress Anna Kendrick is no exception.

Kendrick, who has Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates hitting theaters in a few weeks, may not know much about comics or super heroes but she does have on particular Marvel character in mind should she ever suit up.

""My brother sent me a Squirrel Girl comic because he thinks I should [play her],"" Kendrick tells Net-A-Porter. ""I don't know what Squirrel Girl does other than be half squirrel, but I could be half squirrel!""

Kendrick would probably be a great fit for the ambitious and spunky Doreen Green. Her first encounter with Iron Man, when Squirrel Girl tries to impress him and convince him to let her join his super hero escapades, would be a blast having Kendrick riffing with Robert Downey Jr..

The inspiration to play a hero does have a source for Kendrick: Ryan Reynolds. ""Ryan is one of the most authentic people I've worked with; I can't think of a person more deserving of a hit like [Deadpool],"" the actress explains. ""He worked for so many years to get that film made because it's a character that was inside of him.""

Deadpool was very much a labor of love for Reynolds who pushed to get the movie made for years on end. It wasn't until some test footage leaked and the Internet went wild in support of a Deadpool film that Reynolds got to bring the character many say he was born to play to life on the big screen.

Will the same be said of Kendrick and Squirrel Girl?

"Vincent Desiderio thinks Kanye West is ""a remarkable man."" He goes on: ""Fundamentally, he’s an artist and I have total respect for him."" ",http://time.com/4384498/artist-vincent-desiderio-kanye-west-famous-video-sleep/,"Kanye West’s controversial video for “Famous” has been making headlines for its nude depiction of celebrities like Taylor Swift, Rihanna, George W. Bush, Donald Trump, Amber Rose, and Ray J tangled up in bed together, in a bizarre but intriguing tableaux of his oft-dramatic relationships with other celebrities. See the NSFW comparison here.

However, West, the self-proclaimed “greatest artist of all time” pulled major visual inspiration from another artist — realist painter Vincent Desiderio, whose 2004 piece, “Sleep” debuted at New York’s Marlborough Gallery and was later completed in 2008.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan, Desiderio — who is also a visiting critic at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts — reveals that he was not only supportive of the rapper’s artistic vision, but that he was happy with the end result.

“It’s an extraordinary and bold and different move for Kanye West,” he said. “And what I would say is that it is the clearest indication of his overall intentions as a person utilizing the media and working within it. I was absolutely floored and incredibly flattered and incredibly happy to see the video, which I think is really beautiful.”

Desiderio also disclosed that he found a kindred creative spirit with West, whom he respects as an artist in his own right.

“I think he and I are on the same page and he knows that, I know that. We both acknowledge that we are one brain, two bodies. He’s quite a remarkable man, not withstanding all the nonsense that accompanies a man strapped to a rocket, who sometimes is either misquoted or is compelled into a position that can frustrate someone.

Think of how Andy Warhol was intentionally misconstrued because he put himself out there to be misconstrued. Think about how his whole life was a performance piece and then you understand why Kanye at one point said, ‘I’m Andy Warhol.’ The way we’re thinking about Kanye West and the way he’s portrayed, there’s an orchestration to it, but social media is so large right now that it spins wildly out of control. Fundamentally, he’s an artist and I have total respect for him.”

Take walks on beaches. ,http://time.com/4384106/taylor-swift-tom-hiddleston-photos-beach/?xid=time_socialflow_facebook,"Neither Kanye West’s very naked “Famous” video nor the controversial Brexit results could keep Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston from celebrating the 2-week anniversary of their very well-documented, budding romance in the United Kingdom this weekend with what appears to be their favorite activity: beach strolling.

The pair paid homage to their first outing as a couple by replicating their Rhode Island beach jaunt on the beaches of Suffolk, with not just one long walk on the beach, but two during a whirlwind 24-hour trip to the U.K.

According to the Daily Mail, the singer flew Hiddleston out to the U.K. on her private jet, accompanied by five bodyguards, because a getaway with an entourage is nothing if not very romantic. The pair then fittingly rented a “Bond-inspired” Jaguar and visited Hiddleston’s old stomping grounds, taking time to stroll on the beach with Hiddleston’s mother and sister.

As with all outings since this blossoming relationship started, it was faithfully documented by the paparazzi at a very close proximity, which is a real boon since Taylor has adopted a charming English country style since linking up with Hiddleston.

Stay tuned for more beach dispatches from Team Hiddleswift; after all, a couple that walks beaches together will probably, maybe stay together.

She left when she saw Beyonce enter the building. ,http://www.bet.com/celebrities/news/2016/06/08/rachel-roy-fled-beyonce.html,"Rachel Roy has been in hiding ever since she was outed as being the home wrecker on Beyoncé 's Lemonade , so we were all surprised when the designer and pop icon were both spotted at the same event this week: the CFDA Fashion Awards, where Bey was given the Icon Award. Well, turns out, ""Becky"" took her good hair and ran straight out the building as soon as she saw Queen Bey coming.

According to Page Six, Rachel Roy hastily left the building as soon as rumors started circulating that the Carters were dropping in on the event unexpectedly — of course, it's not like Bey would RSVP — to avoid Bey's death stare.

Whispers of the Carters surprise arrival started as soon as the lights went down. One fashion writer tweeted, “Jay Z has just arrived... What could it mean?” Then Beyoncé’s daughter, Blue Ivy, and mom, Tina Knowles Lawson, showed up, making it clear that the Queen was on her way.

Roy, apparently, took that as her cue and dashed before Beyoncé entered the building. “She disappeared with her place card and never came back,” said a source. ""[It was] weird. I don’t know if it was because she’s ‘Becky,’ or what?” Another stunned source at the event said, “Rachel just came and left.”

While Rachel's official excuse is that she had to catch an early flight to LA to be with her kids, this latest display of bizarre behavior isn't doing anything to squash those Becky rumors.

We would say let this be a lesson to anyone who crosses Beyoncé, but that's already perfectly clear.

But instead of crying teardrops on her guitar, the singer has taken up a new hobby to get over her ex-beau - designing greeting cards.

Taylor has decided to shake off any hard feelings and keep any cat custody squabbles out of mind by teaming up with Papyrus to design cards in aid of charity. With uplifting slogans such as ‘You Are Actual Sunshine’ and ‘Yay You!’, it seems there's no bad blood between Taylor and Calvin.

Leia snubbing Chewbacca and rushing to hug Rey at the end of the film was a mistake due to scene blocking. ,http://www.mtv.com/news/2751778/jj-abrams-star-wars-the-force-awakens-mistake/?utm_source=zergnet.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zergnet_1019800&xrs=mtvnewszergnetext,"Lucasfilm

Star Wars: The Force Awakens hits DVD shelves in less than a month, which will undoubtedly prompt diehard fans to comb the film for mistakes and easter eggs they hadn’t noticed in theaters. But there’s one gripe that’s been eating away at fans for months: a random exchange and awkward snub involving Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey that takes place near the end of the film. (In other words, there are major spoilers ahead, so please proceed with caution if you’re one of the three or so people in the world who somehow hasn’t seen this movie.)

The scene in question comes just after Han Solo’s death at the hands of his own, weirdly emo spawn, Kylo Ren. The crew of resistance fighters return to Starkiller base with the bad news and with the injured Finn in tow, and Leia seems to sense what happened to her estranged husband. She looks to her friends for comfort, but for whatever reason, she brushes off Chewbacca and hugs Rey instead. This was weird because Leia’s known Rey for all of, like, two seconds, but mostly because Chewbacca was Han’s partner-in-crime, and a lifelong friend of both Han and Leia. So why would she snub him like that?

Director J.J. Abrams recently caught up with Slashfilm, where this very topic was discussed at length. And while Abrams admits it was a “mistake,” he chalks it up to an unfortunate matter of positioning and blocking.

“That was probably one of the mistakes I made in that,” Abrams said. “My thinking at the time was that Chewbacca, despite the pain he was feeling, was focused on trying to save Finn and getting him taken care of. So I tried to have Chewbacca go off with him and focus on Rey, and then have Rey find Leia and Leia find Rey. The idea being that both of them being strong with the Force and never having met, would know about each other -- that Leia would have been told about her beyond what we saw on-screen and Rey of course would have learned about Leia. And that reunion would be a meeting and a reunion all in one, and a sort of commiseration of their mutual loss.

Lucasfilm

“Had Chewbacca not been where he was,” Abrams continued, “You probably wouldn’t have thought of it. But because he was right there, passed by Leia, it felt almost like a slight, which was definitely not the intention.”

Some fans have taken Leia and Rey’s embrace as a hint at Rey’s lineage -- was Leia drawn to her because Rey’s part of the Skywalker bloodline as well? Whatever the case may be, we can only hope Leia and Chewbacca kiss and make up in Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: Episode VIII, which hits theaters on Dec. 17, 2017. Patience, friends.",J.J.

"Qloo, a “cultural recommendations engine.” ",http://time.com/4372249/leonardo-dicaprio-startup-qloo/?xid=tcoshare,"Fun fact: Leonardo DiCaprio, everyone’s favorite Oscar winner and climate change activist, is also a low-key businessman. The actor has invested in everything from a garbage company to an Amazonian tea purveyor and the popular mattress startup Casper, as documented on Crunchbase. His latest move involves sinking some cash into Qloo, a startup that bills itself as a “cultural recommendations engine.”

So how does it work? Qloo says it has “mapped the taste genome” by combing through massive amounts of data. Then, it spits out answers to burning questions from brands and advertisers about the preferences of their target audiences when it comes to things like food, music and TV. For instance, as TechCrunch reports, Qloo can tell you the favorite music artists of fans of the Golden State Warriors vs. fans of the Cleveland Cavaliers. That’s no small thing: it helps advertisers ensure they’re marketing the right things to both groups, collectively or separately, based on what they do and don’t share. (For instance, Warriors fans like Drake and Cavs fans like Li’l Wayne, but both groups like pizza and SportsCenter.)

The Series A round, which DiCaprio participated in, raised $4.5 million for the company. DiCaprio certainly has eclectic taste in investments; only time will tell if this endeavor will reap the same kinds of rewards he’s been bringing in with his work on the big screen.

She vacationed next to a woman who listened to a whale sounds album. ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1523910/the-hilarious-and-weird-story-behind-ellen-degeneres-learning-to-speak-whale-in-finding-dory,"One of the most humorous scenes in Pixar's hit Finding Nemo involves Ellen Degeneres' Dory attempting to ""speak whale."" The whale speech makes a comeback in this weekend's sequel Finding Dory, and we actually learn how Dory learned the language, but the story about how Ellen learned the language is an even better one. She spent one vacation listening to whale sounds for an extended period of time, and the bizarre experience stuck with her.

The cast and crew of Pixar's Finding Dory were part of a talk at Google recently when one attendee asked Ellen Degeneres how she learned to speak whale. She also asked the question partially in whale, because this is Google and the company is full of nerds. Ellen then told a story about being on vacation in Hawaii and finding her rental house next to a woman who would spend her days doing fairly mad levels of yoga, all while listening to an album of whale sounds.

I didn't know you could buy that record, but there's a record that just is whale sounds. And I was listening to it...and it was just the weirdest thing I'd ever seen in my life

This experience gave Ellen Degeneres an intimate, if unwanted, familiarity with the sounds of whales, so when Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton asked Ellen if she would ""speak whale"" for the film, she knew exactly what to do. Stanton, for his part, thought Ellen would veto the idea without a second thought, but instead, she dove in.

It's not all fun and games, however. According to Ellen Degeneres, there are downsides to speaking whale.

It's not easy...if you have to do it a lot it's very, it's tough on your vocal chords. You have to kind of warm up.

There's actually quite a bit of whale spoken in Finding Dory as a major character in the film is Destiny, a whale shark. A whale shark is actually a shark, not a whale, but one should apparently not tell Destiny that. You can check out the full talk at Google below, the pertinent part regarding speaking whale begins at the 29:20 mark.

To see how the crowd reacts. ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1524030/why-jeff-goldblum-plans-to-sneak-into-a-movie-theater-showing-independence-day-2,"Roland Emmerich makes movies that demand to be seen on the big screen. Not just a big screen. The biggest screen possible. From the monumental explosions of Independence Day (pun intended) to the planet-rattling chaos of 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow, Emmerich specializes in sequences that fill every inch of the screen with practical and digital madness. Which is exactly why Jeff Goldblum plans to see his latest collaboration with Emmerich -- Independence Day: Resurgence -- in a theater, with a paying crowd, to appreciate how they react to the insanity.

Late last year, I was lucky enough to travel to New Mexico and watch Emmerich at work on the set of Independence Day: Resurgence. It looked like a massive undertaking, and I peppered the cast with questions about the process of working on such an epic blockbuster. Jeff Goldblum, over the course of one of his answers, talked about the joy of seeing one of Emmerich's movies with a crowd, and told me the following reason why he plans to sneak in while the movie's playing and enjoy it with a public audience:

You've asked the right person... because I do like to watch movies. ... I'm thinking of several scenes. It's a spectacular... once again, you can imagine, there's much spectacle. I will tell you this. There's more spectacle than I have seen in any... I think it moves the ball, it raises the bar, whatever metaphor I'm stupidly trying to think of, ahead. So it's going to be something that, even though you think you have seen everything before, you'll go, 'I never... That's bigger, and more than I thought!' So some of that. And I'll enjoy that. And like the last one, it's got some heart, I believe. Roland Emmerich is a person of soulful wisdom and humanity. Once again, he's very interested and passionate about creating characters that, for him, tell a story of loveliness and love, of comradeship and some very touching and sweet and funny things. He's got a very keen sense of humor. So I'm hoping that those moments will be delightful in those ways. And I can imagine, you know, watching it with the audience!

If you can believe it, during that last bit of his answer, Jeff Goldblum actually pantomimed himself eating popcorn, surrounded by an audience as they enjoyed Independence Day: Resurgence together. This is only part of his incredible explanation of the joy of working with Roland Emmerich, so you really have to watch the above clip to get the Full Goldblum, as I now like to call it.

Roland Emmerich's Independence Day: Resurgence takes place 20 years after the original film. Humanity is using alien tech acquired from our original encounter with the intergalactic species to bolster our planet's defense systems. Only, the aliens are back... and they are better prepared. Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner reprise their original roles in the sequel, joining newcomers Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Joey King, Sela Ward, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Jessie T. Usher.

Merlin the Magician (seriously). ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1523940/what-transformers-5-may-be-about,"At this point, there simply shouldn't be anything that surprises you when it comes to the plot for Transformers movies. They're about giant robots who turn into cars and planes, so it's not like incorporating Arthurian legend into the mix really makes the premise that much more bizarre, does it?

How the human characters, played by Mark Wahlberg, and a returning Josh Duhamel, will fit into all this is unclear. The fact that those details appear to be missing from this plot would appear to indicate that the rumors that the franchise would be moving toward focusing more on the robots and less on the people may be true. A number of previously appearing Transformers have also been announced for Transformers: The Last Knight, though, if you're actually capable of telling them all apart, you're a better man than I. The film is currently filming in Cuba.

While seeing a new Transformers movie is probably not something on your bucket list, the fifth entry in the franchise is on the way, so we'd better all just get used to the idea. Production is underway on Transformers: The Last Knight and we know something about which characters will be returning and a few of the robots in disguise who will be in play. Now, some details about the plot appear to have been revealed, and in true Michael Bay fashion, they are batshit insane. Apparently The Last Knight subtitle is some sort of reference to the King Arthur myth. No, seriously.

The Transformers films aren't exactly known for their cogent storytelling, but if the word on Transformers: The Last Knight is accurate, the series is about to achieve a new level of bonkers. According to JoBlo, the new film will open with Optimus Prime discovering the Transformers' home planet of Cybertron, but what he finds is a dead husk of a planet, which he, somehow, is responsible for destroying. The good news is that returning Cybertron to life is possible if Optimus can just obtain a MacGuffin, er artifact. If you just guessed that the artifact is located on earth, you win the grand prize. There's a bit more to it, however, as the artifact is related to Merlin the magician, who, it turns out, received his magic from an early Transformer, because of course he did.

A photo posted by on

If there's anything that actually makes any sense based on this plot, it's the casting of Anthony Hopkins. He seemed like an odd choice for a Transformers movie, and while that's still true, at least now we have an idea where he'll fit. If he's playing a human, he'll probably be Merlin himself, because you'd want a big name to take on a role like that. Either that or he'll simply be a Transformer with an English accent, because you know that's going to happen.

",http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Who-Main-Villain-Suicide-Squad-May-135487.html,"The next DCEU movie to hit theaters will mark one of the weirdest and boldest comic book adaptations ever committed to the silver screen. Suicide Squad hasn’t even premiered yet, and it’s already obvious that the film has taken every possible left turn to set itself apart from what we expect from this genre. David Ayer has a vision in mind, and from what we’ve seen, it seems delightfully fresh.

However, despite the fact that we’re beyond excited for the upcoming release of Suicide Squad, we seriously know nothing about the film’s actual villain. Sure, it will be undeniably awesome to see these characters coalesce on the silver screen for the first time, but the trailers and marketing materials have done very little to inform us of the overarching conflict. What looming threat arises that causes Amanda Waller to bring this group of psychos and killers together? We’ve gone through the details, and come up with five potential big bads that could take center stage once Suicide Squad hits theaters on August 5.

Enchantress

Based upon everything we’ve seen from the Suicide Squad marketing campaign thus far, it seems as though June Moone a.k.a Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) has the strongest chance of taking on the film’s villain role. She’s featured prominently in the film’s trailers – consistently looking quite sinister – and her magic-based powers seem to line up with our understanding that the Suicide Squad will fight magical forces not quite within the realm of science. However, in some many ways, June Moone and Enchantress are two completely separate entities, so it remains to be seen whether or not the titular Squad will have to take down both of them, or just the evil witch persona.

Joker

Recent reports from early screenings of Suicide Squad seem to point to the fact that Jared Leto’s Joker may have no more than 20 minutes of screen time in the final cut of the film. That being said, that doesn’t rule out the possibility that he’s the mastermind behind all of the destruction and carnage we see. It wouldn’t feel too surprising to learn that he’s pulling the strings and manipulating everyone from behind-the-scenes. It could be to lure out the Batman, win back Harley Quinn, or simply to cause chaos everywhere he goes. At this point, nothing from this character would surprise us.

Tattooed Man

Although the Tattooed Man’s presence in Suicide Squad has not been officially confirmed, many eagle-eyed comic book fans seem to have picked up on the notion that rapper Common will indeed portray the relatively obscure character. Typically known as a Green Lantern villain, the Tattooed Man has the ability to manifest constructs from tattoos inked into his skin. The official designation of Common’s character is ""Monster T,"" and a monster featured briefly in the film’s trailers seems to match up with this particular villain’s known abilities, so all eyes are on the Tattooed Man to potentially be the one to cause a major headache for the titular team of super villains.

Lex Luthor

Numerous unconfirmed rumors have persisted for quite some time that Jesse Eisenberg’s Lex Luthor would potentially pop up at some point during the events of Suicide Squad for a cameo. He’s currently rotting in a jail cell, and for Amanda Waller to have him transferred to Belle Reve would make a great deal of sense. For him to be the ultimate mastermind behind the events of the film would most certainly help the universe establish his conniving intelligence in a way that Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice simply failed to do. It would also help expand the reach of the DCEU, making an instant connection between Dawn of Justice and David Ayer's Suicide Squad.

Someone Else Entirely

Like I already said: Suicide Squad seems like one of the best-kept secrets in the entire superhero genre right now. All of the aforementioned characters seem poised to take on villainous roles in some form or another, but there could very well be another threat looming in the wings. Perhaps new facts of the DC lore will receive ample exploration with this one supervillain team-up. The film will reportedly take place in Midway City, so maybe the Thanagarians will show up and cause some trouble. At this point, we will just have to wait and see how it all pans out when Suicide Squad hits theaters on August 5.

"It MAY be called ""Weapon X."" ",http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Wolverine-3-May-Have-Title-It-Makes-Perfect-Sense-135527.html,"While the most recent chapter of the X-Men saga is barely behind us, the next chapter is already hotly anticipated. This is because we know that we’re getting ready for the final performance by Hugh Jackman in his iconic performance as Wolverine. Much has been rumored, but little is actually known, about what Wolverine 3 is all about, but now we can add one more rumor to the list. The newest rumor regards the film’s actual title, which will sound familiar to those who know Wolverine, even though the title apparently won’t include his name. The word is Wolverine 3 will be called Weapon X.

All of our rumors up to this point have implied that Wolverine 3 would take inspiration from Old Man Logan, a comic that sees the character much further along in life, not in the early Weapon X days. This makes the report from Gamezone seem odd, yet, their sources, which they make a point to insist are reliable, are claiming that Weapon X will be the film’s title. While this might not be the title many were expecting, it actually makes perfect sense. The Weapon X program was the experiment that turned Logan into Wolverine and what he went through there has been a key part of his character since the first X-Men movie. We fully expect that Wolverine 3 will be some sort of true finale for the character, and so that may very well mean finding some closure with the experiment that created him.

The first Wolverine standalone film X-Men Origins: Wolverine dealt specifically with the events of the Weapon X program, however, that film was viewed as one of the weak links in the X-Men franchise to date, and its events were essentially retconned out of existence following X-Men: Days of Future Past. The end of that film saw Logan end up in the hands of William Stryker once again, about to undergo the same experiment, so while we know the events still happened, at this point we expect they happened somewhat differently.

Naturally, calling Wolverine 3 Weapon X also forges a connection to the type of cameo that Hugh Jackman filmed for X-Men: Apocalypse. As that scene concluded, the feral Wolverine ran off into the night. Could this film build on that conclusion?

This shrouds the characters' past in some mystery once again, If the film is called Weapon X, but is also taking inspiration from Old Man Logan, perhaps the plan will be to fill in Wolverine’s new history via events that take place in the future, thus completing the character before we say goodbye to him. This connection could also act as the introduction for the character of X-23, the female Wolverine clone, whose character has been rumored to appear in the new film. Maybe the experiments are up and running once again and it falls on a former subject to shut them down?

What do you think of Weapon X as the title for the final Hugh Jackman Wolverine movie. Does it work? Does it need Wolverine’s name somewhere in the title? Weigh in below.","Wolverine 3 May Have A Title, And It Makes Perfect Sense"
"Disney wants a more happy ending like in the classics, and the reshoots will also tie into Episode 4 - A New Hope. ",https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-rogue-one-reshoots-ordered-studio-unhapp/1100-6440339/?ftag=GSS-05-10aaa0a,"Anticipation is high for the next Star Wars movie, the standalone film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which hits cinemas in December. The first trailer was released in April, but now it has been reported that the film might be in trouble and the studio is demanding reshoots.

According to Page Six, executives at Disney are unhappy with the first cut that director Gareth Edwards has delivered. The site's sources said: ""The execs at Disney are not happy with the movie, and Rogue One will have to go back into four weeks of expensive reshoots in July. Disney won't take a back seat, and is demanding changes, as the movie isn't testing well.""

Reshoots on big budget films are not uncommon, and Page Six quoted a source at Disney who defended this decision. ""The filmmaking team and the studio always anticipated additional shooting and second unit work to make the film the absolute best it can be, and the actors were aware there would be additional shooting,"" the source said. ""Coming off The Force Awakens, there's an incredibly high bar for this movie and we have a responsibility to the franchise and to the fans to deliver the best possible movie we can.""

Neither Disney or Edwards' representatives have commented officially on the story.

This isn't the first time that rumours have circulated about potential problems with Rogue One. In January it was reported that Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation writer/director Christopher McQuarrie had been hired by Disney to rewrite the script, and that he had ""saved"" the movie. McQuarrie has a reputation as one of the most in-demand script doctors in Hollywood, and his work on World War Z helped turned a troubled, overbudget movie into a hit.

A number of people involved with the production of Rogue One have spoken about the different approach that Edwards was bringing to the film. When the cast and crew were first announced last year, Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy described how the film ""goes into new territory, exploring the galactic struggle from a ground-war perspective.""

Last month, star Riz Ahmed told Movieweb: ""What Gareth is bringing to Rogue One is [an] incredible, organic, loose, kind of a raw feeling. He speaks about it in terms of a war movie. And he compares it to other war movies. We're doing something a little different to the other films. And hopefully people are ready for that.""

Rogue One is set before the original Star Wars, and focuses upon a group of mercenaries who are hired to capture the plans to the Death Star. The cast also includes Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Forest Whitaker, and Mads Mikkelsen. It hits cinemas on December 16, 2016.","Star Wars Rogue One Reshoots Ordered, Studio ""Unhappy"" With First Cut - Report"
Cersei Lannister. ,http://mashable.com/2016/05/03/game-thrones-heir/?utm_cid=p-fb-traff#lHxBPJzBTRqW#tM_nynXzQuqL,"Update: This post, written after Game of Thrones Season 6, Episode 2, explains the legitimacy of certain events in Episode 10. We've added some brief notes based on the rest of the season, so don't proceed if you haven't seen it.

The body count in Westeros is really starting to pile up -- and the return of one resurrected Lord Commander doesn't begin to make a dent in the numbers.

In Season 6's first two episodes, three of the Seven Kingdoms' most powerful leaders have been usurped and unceremoniously tossed on the scrap heap: Roose Bolton (along with his wife and hours-old heir), Balon Greyjoy (last of the participants in the War of the Five Kings and the last of the leeches burned in the fire by Melisandre) and Prince Doran Martell of Dorne (that guy in the bathrobe and wheelchair).

But the most important death is the one that barely got any attention: the poisoning of Princess Myrcella Baratheon, sister to King Tommen and official heir to the Iron Throne. She was the last Baratheon in Westeros -- legally speaking, at least -- and her absence has the potential to create even more of a power vacuum in Tommen's already ineffectual reign.

Credit: GIPHY

If Tommen were to die without producing any offspring, there'd be no official heir apparent -- a fact that doesn't seem to have occurred yet to his mother Cersei or biological father Jaime. So far, apparently, neither has thought to do what any real-life monarchy would do in this situation: assure the world loudly and often of a secure succession.

Which would be an easy and indeed pleasant duty for them -- if they'd only hit the books to find out who the successor is.

(Note that this is not the case in the Song of Ice and Fire books on which the show is based. George R.R. Martin has kept Myrcella and Stannis alive thus far; he also didn't have Stannis's daughter and heir, Shireen Baratheon, burned at the stake. At this stage, the showrunners are far more murderous than the famous author.)

So who is next in line to the Iron Throne of Westeros on the show, presuming Tommen's death leads to a peaceful and legal transfer of power? The answer might surprise you. But buckle up, because we're going to need to do some serious time traveling through Westeros history.

Even in real life, royal lines of succession can be hard to grasp. First of all, it isn't simply about who is descended from whom. There are several hundred royals in Europe who have more right to sit on the throne of England than Queen Elizabeth II, for example, but they are barred by dint of being descended from the Stuarts, a line of ousted Catholic English kings.

Similarly, if the Baratheons died out, legally and politically speaking, you couldn't simply hand the Iron Throne back to Daenerys, daughter of the Targaryen king that King Robert Baratheon ousted. Once a new dynasty seizes a throne, there's no going back except by force. And Dany's chances of doing that are looking pretty slim at the moment.

Sorry Dany, Dragons don't count when it comes to the line of succession. Credit: HBO

So to find out who would replace Tommen, we have to go through a convoluted Baratheon family tree, find out who married whom, and end up in another House altogether.

But first, a side note: Yes, technically there is a son of Robert Baratheon still alive in the show. His name is Gendry, the only one of Robert's bastards to survive Cersei's massacre. But he is still a bastard, and to ascend to the throne he'd have to have the current king legitimize him.

That's hardly likely, of course, even though Gendry has Baratheon blood in him and Tommen (secretly, sort of) doesn't. The air in King's Landing is thick with irony.

Robert Baratheon

King Robert and his lethal drinking horn. Credit: HBO

The leader of Robert's Rebellion acquired the throne by force. He had three kids, officially and legally at least, with Queen Cersei. Joffrey and Myrcella are dead, leaving only Tommen -- and if the prophecy Cersei received from a witch is to be believed, the other blond-haired kid isn't long for this world either.



The Throne would then pass to Stannis Baratheon, if he weren't pushing up daisies near Winterfell, then his faithful daughter Shireen Baratheon, if she weren't in cinders, then his younger brother Renly Baratheon, if he weren't in an advanced state of decomposition post-shadow baby.

That exhausts this generation of Baratheons. And according to this unbelievably extensive Baratheon family tree, you have to go all the way back to Robert's great-great-great-great-grandfather to find anyone in his family who sired another line that survived.

A hundred and fifty years before Robert was even born, an aristocrat called Corwen Baratheon married a woman named Leyne and had six kids. One of them, Arion, was Robert's great-great-great grandfather. The next one down to have surviving kids was Elyanna, who married a Lord named Mathin. Lord Mathin Lannister.

Mathin fathered Jason, who fathered Demon, who fathered Gerold, who fathered Tytos Lannister. And who was Tytos' firstborn son?



Tywin Lannister

If you were still alive, you'd be here by now. Credit: HBO

Yep, that's right. The old puppet-string puller, Lannister Godfather and Hand of the King could have sat on the Iron Throne in his own right! That is, if he hadn't ended up looking down the business end of Tyrion's crossbow while sitting on the commode.

That being the case, however, his title of heir to the throne of Westeros passes to his firstborn son ...

Jaime Lannister

He's alive and intact! Well, apart from that right hand. Credit: HBO

There's a problem here, however -- Jaime is Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. That's a lifetime post, one you don't simply leave, even if it is to become King. Cersei may want him to rule, but we get the sense that Jaime's sense of honor wouldn't let him leave the Kingsguard even if the small council bent the rules for him.

Update: Jaime was removed from the Kingsguard by Tommen in order to help the Freys capture Riverrun. In theory, that should make him Tommen's heir -- which might explain why he didn't look too happy at Cersei's coronation.

So if Jamie is passed over for the post, what about Tywin's second-born son?

Tyrion Lannister

'King Tyrion, first of his name' has a ring to it. Credit: HBO

Though a peaceful transfer of power to the Imp would be one of the most delicious things we could ever witness in a future Game of Thrones, it's also less likely to happen than Jaime's ascendancy.

You may remember that small matter of Tyrion being convicted and sentenced to death for regicide. He's officially a traitor who lost his trial by combat thanks to an overly-cocky Red Viper.

Even if that somehow didn't legally bar him from the throne, even if his exile thousands of miles away were no impediment and even if he didn't have Mereen to rule over, Cersei would personally slit every throat in Westeros before she'd let her little brother wear the crown.

Besides, Tyrion has made friends with dragons now. What does he need with a dumb throne made of sharp swords?

So unless the Imp intends to steal those dragons from Daenerys and seize power with them himself, the title of heir to the throne of Westeros passes to ...

Cersei Lannister

No longer just Queen Mother. But at what cost? Credit: HBO

Yeah, you read that right. Tommen's rightful heir to the Iron Throne, the next ruler of the Seven Kingdoms if he doesn't get busy with Margaery, is his own mother -- via the most convoluted route of succession imaginable.

Did we just blow your mind?

It doesn't just make sense from a genealogical perspective. It would also be storytelling dynamite.

Picture it: Cersei, fearful of the prophecy and utterly torn apart by the deaths of all her children, is forced to take their place on the throne as she mourns. The ultimate underhanded player of the game of thrones would win it, ironically, by legal means. And the victory would taste like ashes in her mouth.

Perhaps the only sweet part about it for Cersei would be the ability to lord over Margaery again, presuming Margaery will be freed from the Sparrows' clutches at some point. That scene would be the exact opposite of one from Season 5, and would be worth it just to see Cersei swilling her giant wine goblet and destroying her rival with a devastating put-down.

Update: Now we know Cersei was able to remove the threat of Margaery as part of her attack on the Sept -- which may not have left time for a vengeful put-down, but was certainly effective.

Is any of this likely to pass? Not necessarily. The whole of Westeros is under threat from a winter nobody has prepared for, and from the once-in-a-thousand-years civilization-ending threat of the White Walkers. To the east, even if there is no invasion fleet any more, there be dragons enough to cause serious damage. And Dorne, post-coup, is likely to be in full-scale rebellion.

The Baratheon-Lannister dynasty's chances of retaining control of King's Landing in the face of all those enemies seems vanishingly slim. But if the show and the books have taught us anything thus far, it's that you never, ever count this family out.

Update: Turns out the ""Cersei becomes Queen"" scenario was more likely than we suspected. But now you know it was a legitimate ascension to the Iron Throne, and not a coup by the Queen Mother.

Jorah gonna want to read this, ""Game of Thrones"" fans.

With our favorite characters in jeopardy every week on ""GoT,"" we're always looking for any clue or indication of who's about to go next. And no one looks more in danger these days than Jorah Mormont.

In addition to his life-threatening greyscale, actor Iain Glen is now playing a media mogul, à la Richard Branson, on a new show called ""Cleverman."" So now we're really worried.

Does Glen's participation in ""Cleverman"" hint at Jorah's fate?

""I don't think you can draw that conclusion,"" Glen reassured The Huffington Post when addressing our concerns. (Thank the old gods and the new!)

The actor explained that, although it appears ""Game of Thrones"" has a long production process, it's really only shot for half of the year with two units working in tandem. Contrary to popular belief, Glen says new projects are not a good indicator of whether or not a character doesn't make it on the HBO series.

""They've always been amenable to actors doing other work around it. Your guess is as good as mine as to whether Ser Jorah survives into the future. They keep us painfully in the dark, so well just have to see,"" he said.

Even if this season could mark the end of Mormont, fans can take comfort in the fact that Glen's new show is a lot like ""Game of Thrones.""

""Cleverman"" is an Australian-New Zealand fantasy series about what happens when the world of mythology collides with our own. Like ""GoT,"" it explores class and politics, and there's even some monsters and heart-eating, too.

Yum, right?

Though ""Cleverman"" may not have the same budget as ""Thrones,"" Glen says a big similarity is that the show's supernatural aspects enhance the story rather than distract from it.

""I think in 'Cleverman,' there are these supernatural elements in it, but you never get to the point where they bounce you out of the story and say, 'Well, I don't really believe that situation,'"" he told HuffPost.

Glen enjoyed shooting and would be totally up for Season 2 if it happens, which is fine with us. If we don't have to worry about Jorah, then now our ""Cleverman"" watch begins.

Not because she’s starred in her own comics or is part of a popular video game, but it’s because she’s played key roles in popular movies such as Transformers and Teenage Mutants Ninja Turtles.

She’s all set to return this summer as April O’Neil in the upcoming Turtles movie titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. However, Megan isn’t planning to rest and wants to further grow her fan following as she’s looking forward to playing more popular characters, and this time she wants to fill in the boots of a popular fighting game character.

She revealed during an interview with Cinepop when asked if she wanted to play any superhero in a movie, that although she has no idea about a superhero but she’s really keen to play the role of Kitana, the badass hottie from the Mortal Kombat series.

I’ve been getting this question a lot and I should think about it more because I keep drawing a blank. I don’t have a specific superhero that I think I should play. I’m sorry I don’t have a better answer for you I don’t know.

As you all know Kitana isn’t a hero in the series but plays the role of an antagonist. She’s a badass that shows no mercy to her enemies, and is the daughter of Sindel and Shao Khan (adopted).

I thought of Kitana from Mortal Kombat if they ever make that movie again. I’ve always loved her fans and the blades, um, but that’s the only one I could think of.

That’s it, she wants to play the role because, um, she kind of likes the blades. To each their own I guess, but I’ve seen better reasons given by celebs for reprising the roles of fictional pop culture icons in the past. Let’s just leave it at that.

There are whispers that a new Mortal Kombat movie is actually in development and might be helmed by James Wan, who’s directed Fast and Furious 7 among other films. The last Mortal Kombat movie released way back in 1997 and was titled Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.

The film met with a moderate reception and under performed since the original Mortal Kombat movie raked in more revenue at the box office, which is one of the reasons why the series has been in hibernation for so long.

Production staff doesn't communicate about it in written form. ,http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1523960/how-jurassic-world-2-is-keeping-its-secrets-according-to-bryce-dallas-howard,"After the massive success of Jurassic World last summer, its upcoming sequel -- temporarily known as Jurassic World 2 - is without question one of the most anticipated movies currently in development. Of course, that means that the project has to take serious considerations where detail leaks are concerned, and one star has revealed exactly how it's doing that. According to Bryce Dallas Howard, information about Jurassic World 2 is being kept hidden by basically not being communicated about in written form.

The actress recently took part in an early press day for her upcoming movie Pete's Dragon, and I had the pleasure of sitting down with her for an interview. After a long discussion about her work on the Disney movie (more on that in a bit), we concluded the chat talking about Jurassic World 2 and director J.A. Bayona taking the helm. Bryce Dallas Howard mentioned that she's been communicating with the filmmaker, and that she was actually going to be seeing Jurassic World director/producer Colin Trevorrow later that day, but also noted that it's weird talking about the sequel because of the restrictions on communication. She explained,

Whenever I have the chance to be around that group, that crew I like get information. [laughter] J.A.'s over in Europe right now, so I haven't seen him in person. I'm sure he wouldn't... because you know what, the emailing and texting, you can't go on record. You can't write anything down, commit to anything in writing. So, tonight I'll just be like, 'Can you verbally explain to me what's happening?' But we'll shoot it next year.

Studios and filmmakers are constantly looking for ways to prevent details about their upcoming projects leaking to the public, and one could see this being a very effective way. Sure, one can imagine that there's a risk of some material getting scrambled if stuff isn't being written down, but not putting anything in texts, emails or memos means that nobody is going to see material they aren't going to see (and at the most extreme level, it's safe from hackers).

Jurassic World 2 has been seriously in the works for a while now, with J.A. Bayona coming aboard about four months ago. As Bryce Dallas Howard mentioned, the plan is to start filming next year, with Universal Pictures having put a flag in a June 22, 2018 release date. Howard will reprise her role as Claire Dearing, and Chris Pratt will be back as Owen Grady, and while Colin Trevorrow told us that a big theme of the movie will be the proliferation of dinosaurs, not much is known beyond that.

We'll hopefully have more news for you about Jurassic World soon, but you can next see Bryce Dallas Howard in theaters in Pete's Dragon, which will be arriving in theaters on August 12th.","How Jurassic World 2 Is Keeping Its Secrets, According To Bryce Dallas Howard"

What about the new American wizard school in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?

Ilvermorny is the name of the school and the four houses are: Horned Serpent, Wampus, Thunderbird, and Pukwudgie.

The Horned Serpent is a dragon-like serpent with long horns and teeth. They are said to be able to control the weather, particularly rain, lightning and thunder. They can shape-shift, turn invisible and perform hypnosis.

Wampus is a cat-like creature that is pretty much a very scary looking cougar.

Thunderbirds are legendary birds that can generate storms and thunder when they fly. A Pukwudgie is a 2-3 foot tall human like thing with exaggerated ears, fingers, and nose. They have smooth grey skin that glows sometimes. They can disappear and reappear, create fire, and transform into either a porcupine or a cougar.

She does her nails. ,http://www.essence.com/2016/05/11/youll-never-guess-how-empire-star-likes-unwind,"VALERIE MACON

We were first introduced to Annie Ilonzeh during her days on General Hospital. Today, you can catch her every week on Empire as she stars a persistent journalist, Harper Scott. The Nigerian-American actress who hails from Dallas, Texas is one of 5 girls in her family and notes that she grew up in a frugal home. “We didn’t have the luxury to get our nails done all of the time,” notes Ilonzeh. She’s a tomboy at heart with girl next-door appeal that prefers sweats to evening gowns, and has a serious knack for at-home nail art.

When she’s not on set, writing or living her best fit life at the gym, it’s likely that you’ll find her nestled in the comfort of her home jamming her favorite songs and doing her nails. “I was a manicurist in another life,” she states. “Being pampered is great, but sometimes I like to do those things myself because it’s a little therapeutic and gives me some downtime for myself—and I need that,” she states. Between readings and 14-hour set days, some down time is definitely needed. Ilonzeh’s go-to polish is anything nude, she admits to hoarding nude polish and finding it hard to resist buying a new shade (we hear you, girl!) The perfect finishing touch to her manicure? An accent nail—and we’re not just talking a basic polish change. Ilonzeh goes the distance and experiments with jeweled accents, caviar finishes and marbled art—yea, it’s serious! She’s a beauty minimalist after our own hearts!

"Phoebe is a homeless woman who sleeps by the Friends fountain, who dreams of being a part of the group of friends always having coffee at Central Perk. ",http://uk.businessinsider.com/friends-alternate-ending-2015-8?r=US&IR=T,"Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe in ""Friends."" NBC

For anyone who was a ""Friends"" devotee, it seemed apparent there was something lovably wrong with Lisa Kudrow's character, Phoebe Buffay.

The beautiful blonde never quite seemed all there in the hit NBC sitcom. She referenced having a strange past multiple times on the show, too.

Phoebe told other cast members at various points during the 10 seasons that her mother was a drug dealer, that she hung out with a group of friends behind a dumpster, and that she had been homeless.

One ""Friends"" fan took Phoebe's checkered past and turned it into a dark theory about how the series should have ended, and it has gone viral.

The fan, @strnks on Twitter, posted the theory a few days ago and it has gotten attention on publications like Time and Daily Mail. In @strnks' eyes, the show shouldn't have ended with Ross, Rachel, Monica, and the gang walking out of their apartment, leaving the keys on the counter.

It should have ended just with Phoebe sitting in the friends' favorite haunt, Central Perk, staring out the window. In this alternate ending, Phoebe would have been a meth head, creepily staring out the window at five people who are actually friends — Ross, Rachel, Joey, Chandler, and Monica — and daydreaming up the whole 10 seasons, mentally inserting herself into what she assumes their lives are like.

""All 10 seasons were merely her fevered imagination,"" @strnks writes, ""projecting herself into the lives of the others. All she ever wanted was... Friends.""

No way.

Every so often you'll come across a random fact that completely floors you and this particular revelation is mad altogether.

Apparently, the brains behind that McDonalds jingle, you know the one, I'm Lovin' It, is none other than rapper Pusha T.

Former record company exec Steve Stoute, who now heads up his own marketing business, recently chatted to New York-based radio station, Hot 97, and revealed the inside information.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBlD2N_AwgI

He said that it was one of the first projects his marketing firm, Translation, looked after.

According to Pitchfork, the information came about when Hot 97's Ebro Darden initially referred to the jingle as the work of Pharrell and Justin Timberlake.

Stoute wasn't long putting him right and apparently said: ""No you know who did that? Pusha T"".

So, JT sang but it was Pusha T who came up with the slogan and the jingle.

"JD in ""Thelma and Louise."" ",http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Famous-Role-George-Clooney-Hates-He-Lost-Brad-Pitt-135547.html,"Brad Pitt and George Clooney, quietly, have made a ton of great movies together. The real-life friends have collaborated on everything from Coen Brothers comedies to a trilogy of Ocean’s capers. But back in the day, the two reportedly went out for the same roles, with Pitt getting the better on Clooney for at least one specific role that haunts the one-time Batman to this day.

Decades ago – long before he played Tyler Durden or Benjamin Button – Brad Pitt was cast as the handsome thief J.D. in Ridley Scott’s Thelma & Louise. Naturally, Pitt’s looks and charisma helped earn him the part, but as it turns out, he edged future bestie George Clooney for the role. Geena Davis, who played Thelma in Sir Ridley’s classic, recalled that she learned this fact while sitting opposite Clooney on a flight. As she recalls:

At one point, he says to me, ‘I hate that Brad Pitt.’ And I say, ‘No you don’t. He’s your good friend, right?’ And he said, ‘Oh, I hate him because he got the part in Thelma & Louise.’ And I said, ‘Did you want that part?’ And he said, ‘Couldn’t you tell when I read with you?’

Only, according to Geena Davis, she had no recollection of reading with George Clooney for the part! She was so enamored with Brad Pitt – who, to be fair, looks like a god constructed from perfect clay – that she hardly noticed Clooney, and didn’t recall meeting him until that day on the airplane, years later. Davis tells the whole story on The Late Late Show With James Corden, and it’s really worth a listen:

Now, when Thelma & Louise would have been casting (in 1989 or ’90), George Clooney was a TV actor whose “greatest” cinematic credit was playing Matt Stevens in Return of the Killer Tomatoes. He’d appeared on The Facts of Life, and was starting to make a name for himself playing Roseanne Barr’s supervisor, Booker, on the sitcom Roseanne.

But he hadn’t yet become “George Clooney, International Superstar,"" and it probably cost him a significant role. Of course, both Clooney and Pitt ended up doing just fine. But could you imagine Clooney as J.D. in Thelma & Louise? Would the part have worked just as well without Pitt’s outlaw charms?

Clooney isn't the first actor to deeply regret passing on a role. And he won't be the last. But I don't think he regrets it nearly as much as these actors, who ALMOST played superheroes but, for reasons we may never understand, passed on the chance. Some of these still hurt!

Mel Gibson as Odin in the Thor movies? We're not sure that we can actually see that, but according to the Lethal Weapon actor, it almost happened. Gibson admitted this while promoting his latest movie at the Cannes Film Festival, and without even realizing it, he helped himself join an exclusive club of actors who had been offered prominent roles in superhero franchises, only to pass (for various reasons).",The Famous Role George Clooney Hates That He Lost To Brad Pitt

She wants kids. ,http://www.sohh.com/youll-never-guess-whats-forcing-khloe-kardashians-lamar-odom-divorce/,"Reality TV star Khloé Kardashian is reportedly back at filing for divorce from estranged husband Lamar Odom and it’s all centered on kids.

According to reports, Khloé’s main reason for wanting the divorce to go through is her intent to start her own family.

Our sources say Khloe sat Lamar down recently and explained she wanted a family, and couldn’t even start the process of looking until she was single again. We’re told Khloe made it clear to Lamar from the time he almost died last year … she was dropping the divorce because she wanted to help him get better. She vowed not to re-file until he was able to run his own life day-to-day, and she believes he’s at that point right now. (TMZ)

Earlier this week, KK shouted out her sister Kim Kardashian and brother-in-law Kanye West‘s two-year wedding anniversary.

In April, Lamar updated fans on his relationship status with Khloé.

“We did talk, you know, everything is [up for] discussion,” Odom said of his ex. “We talk about anything. We’ve been through a lot. It won’t ever stop.” But these days, Odom has more than his personal life on his mind. He told ET that his next step is to “get back on the court.” “I still got it,” he said. (Entertainment Tonight)

Emma Roberts, of Julia Roberts fame, has committed a crime so heinous it requires a two-sentence Daily Mail headline. “Already feeling nostalgia?” sneered the tabloid this afternoon. “Emma Roberts is still wearing her updo braids TWO DAYS after debuting the glamorous look at the Met Gala.”

That’s correct. The 22-year-old Scream Queens actress has worn the same French braids three days in a row. As you can see in the photo collage above, Roberts wore the style (1) to the Met Gala on Monday night, (2) to JFK airport on Tuesday, and (3) to a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in Los Angeles today. Those braids have spent five hours on a cross-country flight, and they are still hanging on for dear life. Roberts changed her clothes and her sunglasses, but not her braids. They remain.

"Chris Evans, of Captain America. ",http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Marvel-Actor-Stan-Lee-Says-He-Bonded-With-Most-135407.html,"Everybody has his or her own favorite Marvel hero. Some people love Iron Man, other people love Thor; Marvel legend Stan Lee is no different. Over the years, he has struck up a strong relationship with many people within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This begs one interesting question: which MCU actor has Stan Lee bonded with the most over the franchise's eight-year history?

Stan Lee recently made an appearance on Larry King Now, and he was able to quickly answer that question when the host raised the issue:

Chris. The fellow who plays Captain America, he was the Human Torch and then they made him Captain America and he’s the greatest guy, but I love them all.

So it seems that Chris Evans and Stan Lee have developed a bond unlike any other shared between members of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That being said, Stan Lee does sort of hint that Chris Evans has a bit of an advantage over other Marvel actors. As he portrayed the character Johnny Storm, a.k.a The Human Torch, in Fantastic Four, as well as Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, he has had the opportunity to meet Stan Lee prior to the very existence of the MCU.

Of course, being the nice guy that he is, Stan Lee doesn’t entirely play favorites. He makes sure to note that he loves all the actors who play his beloved heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he has managed to strike up strong bonds with all of them over the course of the last eight years. Still, let's not forget that Captain America was one of the first superheroes he ever worked on.

Chris Evans is an actor who has really grown into his role as the Marvel Cinematic Universe has worn on. He seemed like a decent fit when Captain America: The First Avenger hit theaters back in 2011, and with each successive film he has seemingly become more and more comfortable with the role of Steve Rogers. In fact, as time has worn on he has arguably become one of the pivotal faces of the MCU—even rivaling the iconography of Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark on numerous occasions. He plays the role of the Star-Spangled Avenger so well, it’s not hard to see why Stan Lee respects him so much.

Don't take our word for it. Check out the clip below to see what Stan Lee has to say regarding the matter:

It’s possibly the single most relaxing television show ever in existence, and we now have access to it whenever we want. Get excited, because Bob Ross is back.

In case you need a refresher, Bob Ross made a name for himself with his show The Joy of Painting, which aired on PBSfrom 1983 to 1994. Ross’s soft spoken voice and his incredible painting skills made for the most calming TV experience one could ever hope for in the ’80s and ’90s. Not to mention his trademark curly hair that made him instantly recognizable.

But just so everyone’s clear on what to expect — Netflix isn’t streaming The Joy of Painting, but rather Beauty Is Everywhere, a series that was filmed in 1991 a few years before Ross died of Lymphoma at age 52. The format is nearly identical to the original show, the only difference is, you probably haven’t seen any of these 25 episodes.

But how does she juggle it all and look so good doing it? Here, she gives us a little glimpse into her world.

NewBeauty: Being that you travel often, especially on the campaign trail, do you have any beauty hacks for busy women who are always on the go?

Ivanka Trump: It’s so important to stay hydrated while traveling. It’s an easy hack, but drinking lots of water really helps you to stay glowing and energized during long trips. When I can, I drink lemon with my water—it dresses it up a little bit!

All of the Spa Suites feature deep soaking tubs and women can mimic the experience in their own homes by taking some time out after a long day, drawing a warm bath with aromatherapy salts, lighting a few candles and enjoying a couple minutes of pure relaxation.

NB: Do you have a favorite spa treatment?

IT: As a working mother of three, it’s not often I get to enjoy a spa treatment, but when I do, I love a classic deep tissue massage. This is especially helpful right now, as my neck and back are always sore from carrying around my two toddlers and infant son.

Thankfully for Jay and Bey fans, it’s a good one. Word is the two have been working an entire album together. And it’s safe to say the speculation of problems in their marriage served as a good distraction to keep fans from finding out what was really going on between them. Interestingly enough, this now not so top secret album will touch on the rumors that have been making their rounds on the Internet.

A source confirmed the news with Page Six and said Sunday, “Jay and Beyonce were never going to do an interview to address all the questions that came up after Lemonade. It’s more their style to respond through music.”

Lemonade is Beyonce’s sixth studio album. She switched gears this time around and premiered it as a visual album on HBO April 23 (which fans got to enjoy for free). Jay Z’s appearance paired with Beyonce’s lyrics caused fans to think she was finally spilling the real details about trouble in their marriage. Let’s just say that in one line she urged him to go get “Becky with the good hair.”

At this point in the series, fans of both the show and the books know there’s one major character who hasn’t yet been introduced at all. Well, to be fair, there are lots of major characters who haven’t (and won’t) be introduced, this one is different. Her name is Lady Stoneheart and we already have met her. Sort of.

Lady Stoneheart is the resurrected corpse of everybody’s favorite Tully turned loving Stark, Catelyn. In the books, the brotherhood without banners takes the Lady’s corpse (Thank you, Red Wedding) and brings it back to life (and we know from Arya’s time with them that they totally have the capability to do it). Many fans of the books were surprised that the character hasn’t yet shown up in the series since she has a major hand in the fates of other characters.

There was some speculation that the show may just skip over the character altogether and find other ways of getting to the same fates. People also thought that maybe the showrunners didn’t want to show a major character’s resurrection because it would take away from the (year-long) speculation about Jon Snow’s death. But now that Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are both headed to Riverrun (where Lady Stoneheart, aka Catelyn Stark, happens to be from) to deal with her brother the Blackfish, all the dominos are finally in place for the character’s big reveal.

And, from what we know of Lady Stoneheart, she will definitely make an entrance (you know, if the show decides to bring her in).

This season has already been filled with tons of stories of resurrection, both literal and metaphorical. From Jon Snow’s most obvious return to the resurrection of Arya Stark (with her reclaiming Needle and seemingly giving up her quest to give up her identity and serve the Faceless God) to Daenerys’ return to her rightful place as Khaleesi, it would definitely fit with the season’s overall theme. And it’s likely no coincidence that another Stark we thought was dead just happened to pop up, resurrected and transformed, in the last episode.

Hopefully we can see this badass character make a memorable appearance. And, while they’re at it, maybe we can bring back Robb Stark just, you know, because? (*SWOONS AND CRIES FOREVER*)","Could Lady Stoneheart finally be coming to ""Game of Thrones""?"

"Newest theory, Poe is her brother. ",http://hellogiggles.com/theory-reys-possible-family-means-crazy-things-next-star-wars-movie/,"For all the lightsabers, X-Wings and Wookies, Star Wars has always been, at its heart, the ongoing story of the galaxy’s most dysfunctional family. Now, if one recently revealed fan theory turns out to be true, you can expect the familial drama to get even messier in Episode VIII.

According to Reddit user Beeslo, there’s a chance that scavenger turned (possible) Jedi, Rey, and the best pilot in the resistance, Poe Dameron, could be siblings. While finding false connections between characters is pretty common place in Star Wars fandom (remember when we were all convinced Emperor Snoke was actually Jar Jar Binks?), Beeslo actually has some not-totally-crazy evidence to back up their claim.

In the Star Wars universe comic Shattered Empire — a story that bridges the gap between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens — we’re introduced to Force Trees. These are trees that, as you can probably guess, are imbued with the living force. At the end of the four-part series, Luke Skywalker bestows a Force Tree on to a trusted friend, a pilot named Shara Bey. Shara plants the tree outside of her house, which she shares with her young son, Poe Dameron. That certainly helps explain what makes Poe such an insanely talented pilot — he was absorbing the Force every time he went to play in his family’s backyard!

poerey.jpg Credit: Lucas Film

From here Beeslo begins to theorize that maybe Poe wasn’t an only child, maybe his parents gave him a little sister. And if just hanging out around a Force Tree can give you Force powers, imagine how powerful a kid conceived near one would be. Honestly, this makes us feel a little bad for Poe. It’s never easy when your younger sibling turns out to be better than you at everything. Imagine how he’ll feel when he discovers his little sister, Rey, is an advanced level Force user while he’s never even wielded a lightsaber before.

Obviously the theory isn’t one hundred percent sound. For one thing, Rey and Poe don’t share any screen time in The Force Awakens. It’s hard to imagine that the filmmakers wouldn’t even hint at such a gigantic relationship. Then again, there were no real hints in A New Hope that Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader shared any kind of lineage. Maybe we’re just being kept in the dark for an Empire-sized reveal.","This theory about who Rey's family is means crazy things for the next ""Star Wars"" movie"

Here's something you don't see every day: A tie on the game show ""Wheel of Fortune.""

SEE ALSO: 'Jeopardy,' 'Wheel of Fortune' Renewed Through 2018 by CBS

Wednesday's episode of the popular puzzle game hosted by Pat Sajak featured two contestants, LaToya Williams and Danielle Gilseth, each amassing $24,000 in cash and prizes leading up to the bonus round.

A tie is exceedingly rare on ""Wheel of Fortune,"" where players compete to solve hangman-style word puzzles. In fact, the last time such a stand-off happened was more than 10 years ago, according to syndicator Sony Pictures Television.

The producers then offered the pair a tie-breaker round.

See 'Wheel of Fortune' blunders:



Williams won the tie-breaker, then proceeded to a bonus round where she solved the puzzle: ""POUR YOUR HEART OUT.""

""I feel great,"" Williams said after finishing the bonus round. ""I thought I was going to pass out.""

All told, she took home $125,000 in cash and prizes, including a trip to Costa Rica.

""Wheel of Fortune"" is the No. 1 syndicated game show and is renewed through at least 2018. The format was created by talk-show host Merv Griffin in 1975 and has run in syndication since 1983.

Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever. ,http://www.ozy.com/acumen/whats-the-worst-movie-ever/65509#.V0YRe37ATGE.facebook,"Entertainment was pretty great in 2002. We had singer Jennifer Lopez, footballer David Beckham, pop girl group Las Ketchup, young Brad Pitt. But perhaps it ought to be remembered for a big flop, headlined by familiar blockbuster stars Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu. Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (2002) might be the worst movie ever made, according to critics.

100 percent of the experts on Rotten Tomatoes rated Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever as “rotten.”

That’s right: 115 out of 115 critics — let’s be honest, a pretty huge sample size — would take back the 90 minutes stolen from them, rating the film a green splat rather than a well-rounded tomato. Critics, when asked to rate it out of 10, gave it a measly 2.6, and general audiences gave it an even lower 2.2. “Sometimes it’s surprising how stupid moviemakers think we are,” John Wilson, founder of the Razzie Awards, which celebrates the worst movies every year, says. Representatives of Ballistic’s director, Wych Kaosayananda, did not respond to a request for comment.

Lucky for Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, it has some company in the zero-percent club. There’s Orgy of the Dead, Return to the Blue Lagoon and National Lampoon’s Gold Diggers. But these other movies have far fewer critics weighing in, so the criticism of Ballistic has more oomph … more than any of its explosions. Full reviews skewered it more specifically: for plot holes, trying unsuccessfully to be like The Matrix, incoherent writing, clichéd tropes and difficult-to-follow storytelling. “It was one bad surprise after another,” critic Nell Minow says, looking back. Personally, we couldn’t hold it together every time the intense background music started up in a fight scene.

Today we live in a kind of golden age for cult movies, where ironic love of cinematic failures from the past can bring people to late-night movie screenings and yield book deals years later to rehash the disastrous experience on set. Bad-movies aficionado Emer Prevost, who runs the YouTube channel “Reaction & Review,” says that Ballistic won’t cut it, though, as a cult movie. It takes a special kind of bad to also be entertaining. “I took the DVD down to a local shop the next day. They said they could give me 60 cents for it. I said, ‘Good. Take it,’” Prevost says.

Of course, Ballistic probably won’t get to keep its place in bad movie history forever. Every year, the Razzies choose new terrible movies. Look back through time and the epitome of worst movie has changed as consistently as Ballistic’s characters’ motivations. Tastes differ on what’s not just bad but horrendous: Some say The Room is the worst; others, Plan 9 From Outer Space. And in all fairness, not everyone despises it. Critic Michelle Alexandria says, “I don’t watch action films for story or even acting. A good action film only has to deliver on the action for me.” So maybe make that 115 out of 116 critics.

Hulu also announced that, like Amazon and Netflix, it's expanding its movie library. It has signed a deal for exclusive rights to a Beatles documentary from Ron Howard, which will be the first of many new documentary movies to be available on the platform.

"""Hey Trump, fu*k you!"" ",http://www.attn.com/stories/8366/jennifer-lawrence-speaks-out-against-donald-trump?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=internal,"During a Friday evening appearance on the Graham Norton Show, Jennifer Lawrence delivered a terse message to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. — ""Hey, Trump, f*** you!""

Much to the audience's delight, she also flipped Trump the bird.

She said she had hoped to deliver the message in person.

The ""Hunger Games"" star told the British talk show host and fellow guests James McAvoy, Jack Whitehall, and Johnny Depp — who recently played Trump in a Funny Or Die satirical biopic — that she had spotted Trump at a concert, and wanted to give him the message in person.

DFree - bigstockphoto.com

“I was at a concert where I heard he was attending, so I had my full security team, like I was like, ‘Find Donald Trump,’” Lawrence said. “I was adamant on finding him and making a video of me going, ‘Hey, Trump, fuck you!’”

""I was adamant,"" she added, but said the run-in ultimately didn't pan out. ""He knew I was looking for him,"" she told Norton.

The star hasn't kept her distaste for Trump a secret.

“If Donald Trump becomes president, that will be the end of the world,” Lawrence told Entertainment Weekly in October 2015.

The actress added that Trump's straight talking persona was especially disconcerting to her.

AP Images - apimages.com

“I was watching him on the campaign trail and one guy said, ‘I love Donald Trump because he’s saying everything I’m thinking and I just can’t say it because of the PC factor.’"" she added. ""And I’m thinking, ‘You are absolutely right. That’s who I want representing my country, somebody politically incorrect. That will just be perfect,’”

Women who have spoken up against Trump experienced major backlash.

As ATTN: has previously reported, after feminist artist Ilma Gore depicted Trump with a micropenis, a supporter of the presumptive GOP nominee allegedly physically attacked her near her home in Los Angeles.

In January, Fox host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly faced a barrage of sexist slurs from Trump supporters after he demanded she be replaced by another moderator during future GOP debates.

This infographic created by Vocativ shows the harassment Kelly faced.

After former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields alleged that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski forcefully moved her out of the way while she was trying to ask the candidate a question after a March press conference, Fields suffered a barrage of abuse from Trump supporters on social media.

Conservative news outlet the Blaze also obtained audio of an individual allegedly making death threats to Fields.

While a few choice Trump supporters have slammed Lawrence on social media, whether the actress will endure the massive online attacks reported by Fields and others remains to be seen.

The producers said a female toy wouldn't sell as well. ,http://trib.al/NGrNtGd,"Once upon a time, Iron Man 3 was going to have a female villain, a true first for the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a few reasons. One, simply being, FEMALE VILLAIN! Two, a female character would have been front and center with plenty of screen time. Unfortunately, this story doesn’t have a happy ending whatsoever, because that female villain never made it into the final version of the movie. Why? Because no one wants to buy a female villain toy, duh.

In a new interview with Uproxx, Iron Man 3 director Shane Black explains that many of the females in the movie had their plots drastically reduced before the movie ever began filming. When discussing Rebecca Hall’s character of Maya — a botanist who has a flight with Tony Stark and then ten years later ends up working for the bad guy — Black explains that in a very early draft of the film SHE was actually the villain behind everything. Until it came time to talk tie-in toys for the movie.

“We had finished the script and we were given a no-holds-barred memo saying [a female villain] cannot stand…because, after consulting, we’ve decided that toy won’t sell as well if it’s a female,” Black states. “So, we had to change the entire script because of toy making.”

WOW. Wow wow wow. If you’ve seen Iron Man 3, you know that Hall’s Maya starts off really strong at the beginning of the movie, and slowly fades into the background. The end of her story is [spoilers, for 2013’s Iron Man 3, but come on] she’s killed by the real villain, The Mandrin. But she was supposed to be The Mandrin.

“[Marvel] called and said, ‘[With a female villain] that’s money out of our bank,'” Black continues. “In the earlier draft, the woman was essentially [Guy Pierce’s] Killian – and they didn’t want a female Killian, they wanted a male Killian…they just said, ‘no way.'”

Black makes it clear that it wasn’t Marvel who got rid of the idea of a female villain, but rather the company behind the toys for Iron Man 3. They believed they wouldn’t sell, and told Marvel they’d lose out on all sorts of $$$, and well, you can see where this is going.","The completely ridiculous reason ""Iron Man"" had to get rid of this female villain"

No. ,http://nerdist.com/does-sean-bean-really-die-more-than-other-actors/,"One does not simply… assume.

Actor Sean Bean has been dying over and over again for 20 years. He’s been dropped from a satellite dish in Goldeneye, shot through the neck with a grappling hook in The Island, peppered with arrows in The Lord of the Rings, and decapitated in Game of Thrones. But with the number of Sean Bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show Legends, maybe it’s time to put the many demises into perspective.

Start looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times. A long enough career can rack up the kills. For example, Robert de Niro has died on screen 19 times. Other stars like Leonardo DiCaprio have died 9 times. So where does Sean Bean fall along this list?

I crafted the following chart to find out:

Click to enlarge!*

It looks like the “walking spoiler” meme has a grain of truth to it. While Bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them — almost a third of his films.

However, even though Bean has perfected his “I’m dying” face, he still hasn’t died the most on screen. Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies.

But the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt. With over 120 movies, Hurt’s death percentage is similar to Bean’s — around 30% — but just seeing the list of Hurt’s 43* deaths is impressive.

He has died in The Wild and the Willing, Sinful Davey, A Man for All Seasons, 10 Rillington Place, The Ghoul East of Elephant Rock, Spectre, Alien, The Elephant Man, Heaven’s Gate, The Osterman Weekend, The Hit, After Darkness, The Black Cauldron, Jake Speed, Spaceballs, Aria, Deadline, Little Sweetheart, Scandal, L’Oeil qui ment, Monolith, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Contact, The Climb, All the Little Animals, You’re Dead, Lost Souls, Hellboy, Pride, Tabloid, The Proposition, V for Vendetta, Outlander, Boxes, An Englishman in New York, Ultramarines, Whistle and I’ll Come To You, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Only Lovers Left Alive, Snowpiercer, Hercules, and finally the TV miniseries I, Claudius.

Maybe it should be #DontKillJohnHurt.

So is Sean Bean a walking spoiler alert? For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park‘s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths/episode.)

Of course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt). In the years to come, we could see Boromir bite the dust enough to become the undisputed duke of the death scene.

"He cast for looks. He compensated by ""turning his back"" when directing a scene. ",http://www.mentorless.com/2016/05/10/how-orson-welles-compensates-for-mistake-in-casting/,"How Orson Welles Compensated for a Mistake He Kept Making When Casting

I have a massive crush for this video interview with Orson Welles shot in Paris in 1967, when the man had fully embraced his persona.

Shot in a restaurant, while eating, surrounded by journalists hanging to his every word, Welles talks about a mistake he has found himself making over and over again during casting, and how he found a way to compensate it while shooting.

So here is what Welles says:

“When I’m casting, I tend to make the mistake of all producers and metteurs en scène (directors), I cast for how you look. I think about (the voice) but how you look is the first consideration.

And then, when I have them on the stage I’m very interested in their voices and it’s too late to change, unless you dub them. I make that mistake a lot. (…)

I think that if (a film) sounds wrong, then it doesn’t look right. Movies depend so much on rhythm. They are so close to music, closer to music than a drama of the theater, that if the sound, and the rhythm of the sound, above all the rhythm, is wrong, no image can save it. Because the rhythm of the sound… I believe sound is the first human sense for the theater, not the eye. I think the first theater was a story told by a storyteller, and it’s a voice, and the voice determines it, and the rhythm of the voice determines the images in some way.

It’s not only what you say, but the rhythm and speed of all the voices in a scene. That’s why often when I direct, I turn my back on a scene.”

—

This was a aha moment for me. Maybe Welles is being Welles, and he was never really turning his back when directing a scene, but I get what he means, and the essence here, even if you don’t want to take it literally, is that ‘sound editing’ when directing your actors is fundamental for a scene to reach its highest potential.

It is in the continuity of Tarantino’s technique to get useful feedback as the screenwriting stage too. Ultimately, if films are moving images, sound is this essential component, this first sense to quote Welles, that glues it all together when it follows the right rhythm.

I love that Welles talked the way you wouldn’t be able to talk today. I can’t imagine any filmmaker admitting that their artistic vision gets clouded by someone’s look over talent to tell a text during casting. But if they do, maybe finding there’s a way to make it work will help.

I know that as I start having my first serious conversations with my producer about casting for In Five Years, Welles’ admission has never felt more useful and relevant.

Rickon has long lived on the “where the heck is that character” list along with Benjen Stark, Beric Dondarrion and Gendry. (Seriously, where is Gendry? He’s the rightful heir to the throne for goodness sake.)

But the baby of the Stark family is returning to the show, according to actress Maisie Williams.

The Game of Thrones cast is notoriously good at keeping spoilers from fans: For almost an entire year poor Kit Harington had to pretend he’d actually left the show. But during an interview with BBC Radio 1, a caller asked the actress who plays Arya whether we would be hearing from Rickon again this season. “Yes, maybe,” Williams tentatively replied. Later she clarified: “Yes, we will indeed… Oh no, I’m literally going to get off the air and someone’s going to email me!”

We last saw the youngest Stark child way back in season three when he fled a Theon-ruled Winterfell with Bran, Hodor and Osha. Bran instructed Rickon, his Wildling babysitter Osha and direwolf Shaggy Dog (yes, he really named a killer direwolf Shaggy Dog) to head for the Last Hearth, the seat of the House Umber, a family loyal to the Starks) in the North.

Now that Jon Snow is back, he’s going to need to battle the Boltons for the North. Rounding up all the Starks—he’s unlikely to reach Arya or Bran, but he may be able to find Sansa and Rickon—would not only protect them from the Boltons but would rally the families loyal to the Starks in their fight for Winterfell. As they say: The North remembers.

Hodor was a warg and stayed in his animal so long that he lost himself. ,http://huff.to/24AXpAk,"HBO

A new theory is sweeping the Internet, and it could even make Hodor say ""damn.""

Besides the whole Jon Snow thing on Sunday's episode of ""Game of Thrones,"" there was one other moment that was almost as shocking:

Advertisement

Hodor talked.

And by talked, we mean he said a hella lot more than ""Hodor.""

In the scene, which was one of Bran's visions into the past, we see Hodor, whose real name is apparently Willis, actually talk to Ned Stark's sister, Lyanna. Sure, he's probably not the sharpest sword in the armory, but he's savvy enough to pick up on a young Benjen Stark's fighting tendencies.

Bran was as surprised as us to discover that Hodor could talk, so how did Willis become the Hodor we know and love today?

Well, Redditors gbinasia and TazoGreenTea have a theory that seems so ridiculous, it actually makes sense.

The theory: Hodor was a warg and stayed in his animal so long that he lost himself.

Whoa-dor.

According to the theory, Hodor was a warg/skinchanger as a kid, but he may have spent too much time in his animal, causing him to lose a part of himself (something Jojen Reed once warned Bran about).

Advertisement

There's also the possibility that Hodor's animal was killed while he was warging into it, which is a traumatic event for a skinchanger. This could've led him to lose his mind.

But if Hodor was a warg, what animal would he change into? Gbinasia explains that the obvious choice is Lyanna's horse:

As a stable boy, it would make sense that his choice would be to warg into a horse since, like dogs, they are docile and are accustomed to his presence. And if the (possibly) only girl treating him nicely was Lyanna, it would make complete sense that this is the horse he would warg into.

From the books, we know Lyanna died at the Tower of Joy. Could Hodor, as her horse, have died there, as well? Or was he perhaps killed in some battle? Is this the real reason Hodor became ... well ... Hodor?

The evidence

1. A whole section in George R.R. Martin's books compares Hodor to a horse.

Redditor PliersD3 points out that in Martin's second book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Clash of Kings, Hodor is straight-up called a horse:

Little Walder cast his splintered lance aside, spied Bran, and reined up. “Now there’s an ugly horse,” he said of Hodor. “Hodor’s no horse,” Bran said.

“Hodor,” said Hodor.

Big Walder trotted up to join his cousin. “Well, he’s not as smart as a horse, that’s for certain.” Is this a hint into the truth about Hodor? There's more, too. Little Walder even speculates that Hodor means ""I love you"" in horse. Plus, in Martin's novel, A Game of Thrones, there's a line where Maester Luwin says, ""Hodor is a man, not a mule to be beaten.” Uh, no offense, Luwin, but this theory begs to differ, bruh.

2. Hodor has taken on the characteristics of a horse.

HBO

After Bran loses the use of his legs in the book, he's often described as riding around on Hodor's back. Also, Hodor appears to fear the dark and lightning like horses might, as revealed in this excerpt from A Storm of Swords:

Advertisement

The lightning flashed again, and this time the thunder came at six. “Hodor!” Hodor yelled again. “HODOR! HODOR!” He snatched up his sword, as if to fight the storm.

3. Wargs can lose their minds when their animals are killed.

A precedent has already been set for when a warg's animal is killed. In Martin's books, Melisandre kills an eagle that has a wildling warg in it. The wildling goes mad because of it, losing control of his other animals.

4. The three-eyed raven has been watching Hodor all along.

Redditor TazoGreenTea brings up a scene from Season 4 where the three-eyed raven tells Hodor, Bran and Meera, ""I've been watching you -- all of you -- all of your lives.""

Why would the raven be watching Hodor if there wasn't a reason to? Did Hodor once have visions like Bran did?

In the Bran flashback scene, we see Lyanna on a horse, Hodor talking and the three-eyed raven warning Bran not to stay in visions too long. It seems a little random, but if the theory is true, then it all makes sense. If Bran stays in visions or wargs for too long, he may lose himself like Hodor.

When The Huffington Post once asked George R.R. Martin about the origins of Hodor, he wouldn't reveal the answer. Could this theory be the reason why Hodor is Hodor? Or are we barking up the wrong Hodor?",This Hodor Theory Is So Crazy It Actually Makes Sense
Captain America should have been gay. ,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/captain-america-civil-war-steve-rogers-sharon-carter-bucky-barnes,"This post contains spoilers for Captain America: Civil War. If you haven’t seen the film yet or don’t want to be spoiled on anything, now is that time to go. Spoilers ahoy after one more firm warning from Cap.

If you’re not deep into internet culture, you may be unaware of the intensely devoted section of the Captain America fan base who consider Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), not Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), to be the true object of Steve Rogers’ (Chris Evans) affection. Oh but they’re out there. Just search Bucky/Steve and you’ll see what I mean. But make sure you have the safe search mode switched on first.

When Captain America: Civil War directors Joe and Anthony Russo went on a publicity tour for the latest installment in Marvel’s Avengers franchise, they were very careful not to throw cold water on the popular fan theory that Steve “Captian America” Rogers and Bucky “The Winter Soldier” Barnes were more than friends. “People can interpret the relationship however they want to interpret it,” Joe Russo said while visiting China. “People have interpreted that relationship all kinds of ways, and it’s great to see people argue about it what that relationship means to them. We will never define it as filmmakers, explicitly, but however people want to interpret it they can interpret it.”

Even Evans and Stan seemed happy to throw fuel on the Bucky/Steve theories during the publicity tour.

But despite what Joe Russo said, doesn’t Captain America: Civil War go out of its way to “define” Bucky and Steve’s relationship when Cap smooches Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) while Bucky looks on approvingly? Where’s the room for interpretation in that moment? And, leaving aside the vague creepiness of Steve making a move on Peggy’s (very willing) niece, the moment itself wasn’t necessary to the flow of the movie at all.

As was the case in Captain America: Winter Soldier, VanCamp is a hugely appealing (if slightly underused) member of the cast. The film even gave her one of Captain’s most iconic comic book speeches when Sharon and Steve are mulling over how to move forward in the shadow of Peggy’s death. It’s a great moment for her and for the story. And while I think Agent Peggy Carter would have encouraged Agent Sharon Carter to join in the big fight on the tarmac, in general Sharon’s insider access to the government served the story very well.",Is This the One Flaw in the Otherwise Great Captain America: Civil War ?

Dropzone. ,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-brings-back-a-classic-/1100-6475993/,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is bringing back one of the franchise's most chaotic game modes. This week's playlist update includes Drop Zone mode, which first debuted in 2011's CoD: Modern Warfare 3.

The team-based mode challenges players to hold objectives to win, with teams earning points by staying inside the designated...drop zone. The first team to reach the goal point total wins the match. The hook with Drop Zone is that killstreaks continually fall from the sky while you're holding the zone, which leads to some particularly turbulent gameplay.

A blog post by Activision offers a number of tips, tricks, and strategies for succeeding in Drop Zone, which is played across a variety of maps such as Crash, Arklov Peak, and Granza Raid.

Drop Zone originated in Modern Warfare 3, and it was subsequently featured in other Infinity Ward-developed titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. The mode will come to Modern Warfare at some point this week across PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

It's a big week for Call of Duty, as Warzone introduces a new way to play, while Infinity Ward will offer double XP for the weekend.

Nepal. ,https://www.gamebyte.com/pubg-has-been-completely-banned-in-one-country/,"PUBG has been banned across the country and others look ready to follow suit.

Banned games come around every so often. Whether banned for their violence, their imagery or for their politics, it’s unfortunately a pretty common occurrence to see a country completely ban a game.

What’s not common is to see it happen to a game that’s as popular as PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, but it seems the battle royale has been banned in the country of Nepal.

Credit: PUBG Corp

Internet service providers were issued a warning from Nepal’s telecommunication authority earlier this week, and were told to block PUBG.

The instructions came from the Kathmandu district court.

Senior police official, Dhiraj Pratap Singh, told AFP [via Daily Mail]: “We sought an order from the court to ban PUBG after floods of complaints from parents, guardians and school organisations to block the game citing psychological impact on teenagers and students.”

Credit: PUBG Corp

The news comes following the death of a 16-year-old in India, who died by suicide after being told by his parents to stop playing PUBG in favour of his studies.

It’s not the first time that PUBG has been blamed for such heartbreaking news in India. Earlier this year, two men in their 20s lost their lives when absorbed in the mobile version of PUBG too close to railway tracks.

Some parts of India (more specifically, a number of cities in the state of Gujarat) have already banned PUBG after concerns of it encouraging violent behaviour and distractions from schooling.

Two dozen young people have since been arrested for violating the ban and playing the game.

Credit: PUBG Corp

In Nepal, anyone caught playing the game will now also face arrest, though the country has come under some criticism for banning the title instead of encouraging restricted play time or gaming addiction awareness.

What do you think about the ban? Will India be the next country to outlaw PUBG?

“Exploring a shared online space, you’ll have the chance to meet with other players, build settlements and bases together, and even raise your own armed fortresses as you advance your mission to dominate this brave new world.”

Your second freebie for April is popular RPG, The Surge, which comes from the creators of “brutal medieval action-adventure Lords of the Fallen,” and is described as “a challenging sci-fi spin on the hardcore RPG genre.”

"Co Director, Tai Yasue had this to say about the lack of Final Fantasy characters:

Sure, some would argue that it didn't live up to everyone's high expectations and the combat was a bit too easy, but as a conclusion to the Xehanort saga, it was well done. As we wait for the inevitable Kingdom Hearts 4, fans are still asking one question.

Where were the Final Fantasy characters?

Yeah, despite the game's foundation being built upon a crossover between Disney and Final Fantasy, we didn't get any characters from that legendary series, outside of the Moogles. Sure, there were Dissidia NT Toys, a giant Cactuar, and statues of Cloud and Auron, but no characters from the series appeared properly.

Kingdom Hearts 3 Ultimania, the official companion book for the most recent Kingdom Hearts game, includes a special interview with director Tetsuya Nomura. Translated by Twitter user @lunesacree via KH13 , Nomura reveals why properties from Marvel and Lucasfilm weren't included in the game, and it mostly boils down to contract complications - the same reason why Mickey Mouse was barely in the first Kingdom Hearts “In order to change those [properties] into a game, contracts must be made with each company separately, and there are cases where other game companies already have contracts, so although the Disney Group has indeed added those [properties], incorporating them into Kingdom Hearts isn't so simple,” said Nomura.""That’s also the reason Mickey is in only one scene in Kingdom Hearts 1,” he continued. ""At the same time, another company was releasing a game that had to do with Mickey, so though we were denied his usage, we persisted and eventually got 'as long as you only have one scene, from far away, as a silhouette, with him waving his hand or something.' Since we had to make the best of the biggest [and only] chance we had, that's why that scene appears that way.""Though we really wanted to see Star Wars and Marvel in Kingdom Hearts 3’s DLC , these comments make it seem less than likely - though certainly still possible. Nomura previously confirmed that both free and paid DLC is in the works for Kingdom Hearts 3.

They believe that it is outdated. #StopClickbait,https://www.gamebyte.com/sony-admits-why-it-wont-be-appearing-at-e3-this-year/,"Sony said last year it won't be presenting at E3, and now we know why.

Sony shocked gamers when it announced last year that it wouldn’t be making an appearance at E3 2019. It’s the first time in E3’s 24-year-long history that Sony has decided not to present, and considering how close we are to the launch of next-generation consoles, it was a move that raised a lot of eyebrows in the community.

It seems like we’ve now gotten some clarity on the matter though, as Sony’s SIE Worldwide Chairman Shawn Layden opened up to CNET [via Destructoid].

Layden explained: “The world has changed, but E3 hasn’t necessarily changed with it,” referencing the way that E3 was set-up at a time before the internet.

When E3 was in its infancy, people got their gaming news from magazines rather the internet, and with instantly-available news via social media, it makes sense to say E3 is a little…old school.

Instead of E3, Layden said Sony will be doing things a little differently with Destination PlayStation.

He said: “We have an event in February called Destination PlayStation, where we bring all retailers and third-party partners to come hear the story for the year.

“They’re making purchasing discussions in February. June, now, is just too late to have a Christmas holiday discussion with retailers. So retail has really dropped off. And journalists now, with the internet and the fact that 24/7 there is game news, it’s [E3] lost its impact around that…

“With our decision to do fewer games — bigger games — over longer periods of time we got to a point where June of 2019 was not a time for us to have a new thing to say.”

So…does this mean Sony’s highly-anticipated exclusive titles, Death Stranding and The Last Of Us 2 won’t be here until 2020…?

Only time will tell!

That’s what I don’t get. In one sentence he says that E3 has lost its relevancy, then he says they aren’t pulling out of E3 forever. It’s almost like he’s being a petulant child about the fact Sony won’t be there this year and having a sly dig at the E3 and others that will be. — Reidzer N7 (@ReidzerN7) February 12, 2019

Erdrick from the Dragon Quest series. #StopClickbait,https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/12/16/super-smash-bros-ultimate-second-dlc-character-leaked-dragon-quest/,"For quite some time now, we've gotten our fair share of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate rumors revolving around the downloadable fighters coming to the hit game. We already know that Joker from Persona 5 is confirmed thanks to a recent trailer from the Game Awards, but the rest of the roster are still shrouded in mystery. Some of these rumors have suggested that particular favorites, from Banjo Kazooie to the Rhythm Heaven choir kids to Waluigi, are coming to the game. Nothing confirmed yet, however.

Now you can add one more to the list. A new leak has suggested that the second downloadable fighter for Ultimate is coming out of left field- a character from the Dragon Quest series.

The info comes from Persona Central (originally translated from 5Channel), which suggests that Erdrick, a long-time favorite in Square Enix's role-playing series, will be joining the party. The information is translated as follows:

Erdrick

Stage is Alefgard

Erdrick (Male) and Erdrick (Female), 2 colors each of Anlucia and the Dragon Quest XI Hero

Slime appears on screen with a skill

Achieved through active collaboration on Square's side

To the benefit of overseas marketing for the DQ series

The following image was also found, possibly cementing the idea that both male and female versions of Erdrick would be included within the game:

But, on top of that, the site has also reportedly found further information about Joker, including his themed stage in Ultimate, as well as the appearance of another character.

Joker

The stage is Mementos

Jack Frost appears on screen with a skill

Game director Masahiro Sakurai did make it clear that Ultimate's DLC roster would surprise fans, and Erdrick definitely falls into this category. And the worldwide appeal of Dragon Quest would make it fairly easy to crossover a character from that universe into this fighting universe.

That aside, do take this rumor with a grain of salt. 5Channel isn't exactly the most common news source out there; and while the details and image look to be fairly accurate, we've seen rumors such as this before where proposed leaks turned out to be unsubstantiated. At least, for now.

Would you like to see a character from Dragon Quest join the Super Smash Bros. universe? Or would you prefer someone from another Square Enix franchise? Lara Croft from Tomb Raider, perhaps?

The Epic Store is working hard to not just provide incentives for players, but for developers too.

The new-ish digital PC store hopes to pull game devs away from Steam by giving them 88% of the revenues, keeping just 12% for itself.

Right now, Steam usually takes around 30% of revenue from devs, meaning Epic Games would be seriously undercutting them with a move like this. With such potential savings for game developers, it’s easy to see why they’d want to publish their game on an Epic store page.

Soldier 76. ,https://www.fraghero.com/overwatch-reveals-one-main-characters-actually-gay/,"In a new short story, released very recently, Blizzard has confirmed that another character from the Overwatch universe is actually part of the LGBT community. The first member of the Overwatch cast to be confirmed as part of the LGBT community was of course Tracer. Now we know that a male character is actually gay. Soldier 76, also known as Jack Morrison, has been confirmed as a gay character.

The healing sniper from the game, Ana, finds a wounded Soldier 76 in the Cairo streets. She then takes him back to her hideout and speaks to him (as well as looked after him I assume). She then sees Soldier 76 going through a stack of old photos and one in particular catches her eye. The one that she spotted was an old one of Soldier 76 with a dark-haired man named Vincent. Here is what happens in the short:

“Vincent… I haven’t thought about him in years,” Ana said. “Still keeping a candle lit for him?”

Jack shook his head. “Nothing like that.”

“You’ve never looked in on him? You must have been curious. All the surveillance power in the world. I bet Gabe would have put a Blackwatch agent on him if you asked,” Ana said.

Jack glared at her.

“Okay, touchy subject.”

Jack laughed. “He got married. They’re very happy. I’m happy for him.” “Vincent deserved a happier life than the one I could give him.” Jack sighed. “We both knew that I could never put anything above my duty. Everything I fought for was to protect people like him… That’s the sacrifice I made.”

“Relationships don’t work out so well for us, do they?” Ana said, unconsciously running her thumb over where her wedding ring used to be.

To change YouTube’s ‘Trending’ page to ‘Staff Picks’. Pewdiepie’s fans are upset that some of his videos are popular but don’t appear on trending yet some videos from other users are getting less attention but are at the top of the list. ,https://www.fraghero.com/pewdiepie-fans-start-petition-change-major-youtube-feature/,"YouTuber PewDiePie was once famous for his horror Let’s Play videos, but he’s now mostly recognised for his social commentary videos discussing news, controversies, memes and the media.

PewDiePie makes no secret of his issues with YouTube as a platform, criticising it for its monetisation criteria, its changes to the algorithm and its tendency to push larger channels to the forefront.

With a bro army of nearly 80 million subscribers, Pewds has an incredible platform for change, as proved by his charity efforts over the years. In a recent video, he questioned why his version of the failed YouTube Rewind 2018 vid didn’t appear in the Trending pages, and his subscribers are pretty riled up too.

Over on Reddit, PDP’s bro army is now tackling the platform’s controversial Trending page, the place where you’re most likely to find the videos YouTube wants you to see.

Redditor and PewDiePie fan green-tea-is-bae posted the following image to the r/pewdiepiesubmissions subreddit, where it’s currently close to 50k of upvotes.

It’s not just Reddit who’s angry about it, with Twitter venting some rage on the topic and branding the platform as ‘bias.’

"There's nowhere else to talk about video games.

",https://www.fraghero.com/streamer-drops-truth-people-watch-gaming-livestreams/,"First came the Let’s Plays, then came the livestreams and now, if you don’t have a favourite Twitch star or keep up with the latest eSports news then you’re sort of…out of the loop.

But why did livestreaming get so popular? For the big dogs like Ninja, the format has earned them millions and millions of dollars, and streams are the perfect place to talk to like-minded fans of games that you yourself enjoy.

One Twitch streamer believes that’s exactly why people enjoy livestreams – because they can go and talk about games.

In a recent stream, Twitch user A_Seagull said to his fans that he believes there just isn’t a place for people to talk about games anymore.

Using the example of Overwatch, he says: “People don’t talk about the game anymore. I watch a lot of stuff. There are probably less than 10 Overwatch YouTubers.

“The only place for discussions in most games is 1) Reddit 2) YouTube 3) Twitch…turns out most of the Twitch streamers are already quitting…

“Who actually talks about the game anymore?”

It might not be a valid point for all games, as Reddit forums such as the r/Reddeadredemption forum have been blowing up since the game’s release – but in a few months, it’s likely that will see a significant drop in conversation.

Check out the clipped video of the stream above and let us know your opinion.

Kotaku writer and Spider-Man fan, Kirk Hamilton recently tweeted a clip of his playthrough of the game in which you can clearly hear a difference between ‘tired’ Spidey and ‘not-so-tired’ Spidey, with the former sounding distinctly out of breath if he’d been overexerted before speaking.

They have stopped supporting the PS2. #StopClickbait,https://www.gamebyte.com/japan-has-officially-given-up-on-a-playstation-console/,"It’s a sad day for us all, as Japan has finally decided to give up on one iconic console.

Kotaku reports that the Sony Interactive Entertainment’s aftercare service for the PlayStation 2 in Japan is coming to an end.

Looking back at all the good times we had, it’s hard not to feel a little emotional at the fact that it’s all over. Grand Theft Auto radio stations shaped many of our music tastes as we grew older. How many of us would have known all the words to Depeche Mode – Personal Jesus by the time we were 10 if not for the PS2?

The console launched on March 4, 2000 in Japan, and hasn’t been in production since 2012. Despite all that, it’s still the best-selling game console ever and Sony Japan respected its brilliance by continuing to service the PS2. Sadly, six years after it came off the production line it is now over.

The company has put out communication to PS2 owners, asking them to fill out online forms to have their machine serviced one last time. The cut-off date? August 31.

Any consoles that arrive at While the console has been out of production since 2012, Sony Japan continued to service to the game machine, keeping it alive. Sony is now pulling the plug. As IT Media reports, Sony Japan asked PS2 owners to fill out online forms by August 31 to have their consoles fixed one last time. PS2 that arrive at the PlayStation Clinic service center in Iwate Prefecture after September 7 will not be serviced. Customer support for the PS2 also officially ended on August 31.

So there we have it. Rest in peace, PlayStation 2. March 4, 2000 – August 31, 2018.",Japan Has Officially Given Up On A PlayStation Console
"From a 2010 interview with Sony engineer Teiyu Goto: “I gave each symbol a meaning and a colour. The triangle refers to viewpoint; I had it represent one’s head or direction and made it green. Square refers to a piece of paper; I had it represent menus or documents and made it pink. The circle and X represent ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision-making and I made them red and blue respectively. People thought those colours were mixed up, and I had to reinforce to management that that’s what I wanted.”
Not really clickbait, but still an interesting read. Although the article does ramble a little. 😊",https://www.gamebyte.com/why-does-the-playstation-controller-have-triangle-circle-x-and-square/,"Since video games have existed, there’s been the need to make your avatar on the screen actually do things.

At first, this was done with simple knobs and joysticks. When video games moved from the arcades to the living room, this seemed to be the way things were going to stay.

But it wasn’t.

And although many controllers share similarities, there’s one that stands out for a very specific reason, and that’s Sony’s PlayStation controller. Why do the PlayStation controllers have a triangle, circle, X, and square?

On top of that what inspired the other design choices for the gamepad?

To find this out, we have to jump back to 1983 and look at Nintendo. After finding success in the arcade and digital toy side of gaming, with the likes of Donkey Kong and their Game and Watch handhelds, they decided to enter the home console market. They used inspiration from some of their Game and Watch digital toys for their control pad. The name of that home console? The Nintendo Entertainment System.

The simple gamepad of the NES helped set it apart from the competition. A four-way directional pad on the left, two buttons on the right, and start and select buttons in the middle. It was easy for anyone to pick up and understand. Something proven by a four-year-old me and my 60-year-old grandma on numerous occasions.

The NES controller set a new standard for the games industry, and as new systems were introduced from competitors the D-Pad quickly became a mainstay, with the face buttons varying in letters and numbers. Nintendo then introduced the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and evolved the gamepad again, in a way that still sees its influence to this very day. Two more buttons were added on the right, and two buttons were added to each shoulder at the top of the controller.

The time of the Super Nintendo was also the time of a collaboration between Nintendo and an electronics company you might have heard of – Sony.

Sony was working with them to make a CD-ROM accessory that would be compatible with the SNES, and began work on it all the way back in 1988 – two years before the SNES even existed. At the Consumer Electronics Shows in June 1991, Sony announced the collaboration to the world. At the show the very next day, Nintendo announced their partnership with Philips to make a CD-ROM accessory. A surprise to everyone… especially Sony.

This created an obvious conflict between Sony and Nintendo and spurred Sony on to make their own console, the PlayStation, which would release in 1994. The story of Sony and Nintendo’s conflict is something for another day, but an important thing to establish, as we explore why they adopted the shapes of triangle, circle, X and square.

In Super Mario World, an enemy called a Magikoopa, or Kamek (depending where you’re from), tries to attack you by firing some magic. How does that magic appear on screen? In the shape of a triangle, circle and square, with what looks suspiciously like an X as well.

Some believe this why Sony chose the shapes they did, but unfortunately that’s not the case – they have some very specific reasons for their shapes and colours.

How do we know this? From a 2010 interview with Sony engineer Teiyu Goto. Teiyu designed the PlayStation controllers and, whilst being interviewed in 2010, explained that the shapes and their colours were not just random, but something deeply thought out. He said:

Other game companies at the time assigned alphabet letters or colours to the buttons. We wanted something simple to remember, which is why we went with icons or symbols, and I came up with the triangle-circle-X-square combination immediately afterward. I gave each symbol a meaning and a colour. The triangle refers to viewpoint; I had it represent one’s head or direction and made it green. Square refers to a piece of paper; I had it represent menus or documents and made it pink. The circle and X represent ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision-making and I made them red and blue respectively. People thought those colours were mixed up, and I had to reinforce to management that that’s what I wanted.

The controller has evolved over the years to include thumbsticks, vibration, and more, but the shapes and a lot of the layout has stayed the same, making them a key part of PlayStation’s brand identity and much more than a bunch of random shapes.","Why does the PlayStation controller have Triangle, Circle, X and Square?"
Climbing towers to reveal areas and points of interest. Such a long article 🙄 it’s an alright read if you want to know a detailed description of the first 2 hours of Spider-Man. ,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-ps4s-first-few-hours-have-everything-we/1100-6460894/?ftag=GSS-05-10aab8d&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_content=5b6e03dd9ac5640001976654&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook,"If you love reading superhero comic books, there's a good chance that a huge part of what makes them so attractive is the way they explore the regular lives of the people behind the masks. Matt Murdoch's daily courtroom drama and neighborhood philanthropy, Jessica Drew's demanding commitments as a single mother, and the multifaceted teenage dramas of Kamala Khan and other student-aged heroes are equally as engrossing as the crime-fighting adventures of their alter-egos. And when work and life clash, that's when things really get interesting.

The more mundane side of superhero stories are rarely explored in video game adaptations, and that's something Insomniac Games is openly talking about as a major point of difference in their take on Marvel's Spider-Man. In the game's first two hours, which I experienced during a recent preview tour, a large chunk of time was spent controlling Peter Parker in his mild-mannered form, as well as Mary Jane Watson. Insomniac explained that this ratio was largely indicative of the rest of the game, with major themes of mentorship and trust as something that would be explored with and without masks.

That might sound like a far cry from what's been shown of Insomniac's Spider-Man up to this point, but these moments hit all the right notes for us. The game's version of Peter Parker falls on the dweeby side, despite being old and having almost a decade of crime-fighting expertise. He's messy, perpetually behind on his bills, and isn't currently in any kind of romantic relationship, all thanks to his second life. But he takes time to visit his Aunt May and catch up with acquaintances, as well as work on science projects as part of his day job, hoping he can do some good there, too.

I spent a large part of Spider-Man's opening hours exploring interior environments as Peter, making and listening in on small talk, looking at photos and reading documents to fill out back-story, and performing research experiments--there are Pipe Dream and pattern matching minigames that can earn you experience points to spend on Spidey abilities. Mary Jane, an investigative reporter in this universe, has her own separate narrative motivations that quickly become entwined in the rest of the plot. Her interactive segments have their own mechanics, which Insomniac told us would grow and evolve over the course of the game. For more on Mary Jane's section in these opening hours, be sure to read Kallie's in-depth account.

But as happy as I was to see a big emphasis on the Peter and MJ side of things, I still had just one thing on my mind, being this was my very first first hands-on: Whether or not Insomniac's Spider-Man was going to surpass the memories I had playing Treyarch's open-world Spider-Man 2 for consoles, generally regarded as the best Spider-Man game to date, thanks to its phenomenal web-swinging mechanics. And it most definitely does, as we've previously reported. Insomniac's Spider-Man adheres strictly to the rule that Spidey's web lines need to attach to a structure, and that creates the wonderful sense of tangibility that is both essential to selling the experience, as well as creating a satisfying need for forethought when traversing New York City.

It works like this: R2 shoots out a web line, and pressing X while mid-swing will let you jump and gain height or distance, depending on where you are in your arc. Pressing X without being attached to a web line will let you perform a quick web zip, which propels you forward, allowing you to gain directional momentum without losing height, and is great for quickly changing directions. Finally, holding L2 will trigger a slowdown, allowing you to aim a cursor and hit R2 to create a direct zipline to that particular point (provided it's in range), and is a great landing technique that allows you to expertly perch on lampposts and other locations, just like a spider can.

Web swinging feels fantastic, and minor additions, such as hitting L3 to nosedive, using Circle + Triangle in tandem with the left stick to perform aerial tricks for experience points, and the motion blur when you pick up a large amount of speed, adds a lot to making the act of getting around town a pure joy. Even Central Park can be traversed by web-swinging, thankfully, so long as you pick a route with enough trees to latch onto.

Movement on the ground also feels suitably Spider-Man-like. Aside from using L2 and R2 to web zip from point to point, holding R2 acts as an Assassin's Creed-like parkour button, allowing you to easily clear obstacles, as well as run up and across the side of buildings. But if you need a break from thinking about how to get from A to B, Spidey can also just take the subway and fast travel to a different station.

The parkour button isn't the only inspiration Insomniac's Spider-Man takes from an Ubisoft series, though. In a move that took me completely by surprise, Spider-Man incorporates the archaic mechanic of tower reveals, that is, points of interest that you have to find, travel to, and solve a puzzle at in order to reveal a map of the immediate area, as well as the locations of other points of interests like side missions, challenges, collectables, and Far Cry-style outposts. Each district of Manhattan represented in the game--Chinatown, Greenwich, Financial District, Hell's Kitchen, Midtown, Upper West Side, Central Park, Upper East Side, and Harlem--has a number of towers hidden within them, which you're required to activate before you're even able to see where you're going on your minimap.

This is strange not only because the mechanic feels incredibly outdated--Ubisoft has moved on, their open-world franchises now focus on more organic discovery mechanics--but it just doesn't make characteristic sense. Insomniac has been pitching their version of Spider-Man as an experienced one, one that's been fighting crime in New York for nearly a decade, and it's incredibly puzzling that this Spider-Man hasn't internalized an intimate geographic knowledge of the city he protects. I don't believe him when he exclaims, ""I'm flying blind here!"" while swinging through world-famous Times Square, no matter what the tower MacGuffin might be.

Any activity revealed by towers can still be found by naturally stumbling across them, and minor Spider-Man 2-style randomly-generated events, such as car crashes and armed robberies, also can pop up unannounced, which is great to see. But the emphasis on using towers to reveal them just seems like a huge misstep, a puzzling addition that feels like unnecessary filler.

But there's still plenty of good filler in there, namely, the number of things you can stuff into Spider-Man's suit. As expected, you can unlock dozens of different Spider-Man costumes by earning experience and leveling up to gain access, and spending different tokens (earned through completing side content) to purchase them for use. Each suit comes with its own unique suit ability to assist you during the game's exciting, Batman Arkham-inspired combat system, but a nice feature is that once you own a suit, you can transfer its unique ability to a different suit you own.

For example, I immediately sought to don the Spider-Man Noir costume, which comes with the ability to stop enemies from calling backup (great for stealth approaches), but swapped that out for the Battle Focus ability from the Advanced Suit seen in the game's marketing materials. Battle Focus steadily increases your Focus meter, used in combat to heal and perform the game's cinematic takedowns. Other suits and abilities I saw included the Classic Suit (webs every enemy in sight), Scarlet Spider (creates holographic decoys), and the Spider Armor MK II (protects from bullet fire).

True to Peter's science background, you can also equip a number of unique combat gadgets, switching between them using a radial menu with L1, and upgrade their effectiveness over the course of the game. Aside from the standard web shooters, they include things like impact webbing to pin enemies to surfaces, spider drones that seek out opponents and fire energy, electric webs that stun, web bombs that are proximity triggered, web trip mines, concussive blasts, and a suspension matrix that suspends enemies in the air.

The game also has a skill tree for ability progression, featuring three branches with which to upgrade Spidey's combat and web swinging techniques. The Innovator branch focuses on web-based combat techniques, such as using webs to disarm gun-toting thugs and the ability to throw a larger variety of objects and enemies, while the Defender branch improves Spider-Man's general striking, evasion, and combo abilities, letting you earn bonuses for things like perfectly-timed dodges. Finally, the Webslinger branch largely lets you perform additional traversal moves, but also gives you access to Spidey's infamous web swing kick in combat. It also unlocks the aforementioned ability to perform tricks in mid-air for small amounts of XP and large amounts of style.

There are a number of references too, of course, found in dialogue, environment, and the game's backpack collectibles. But it's a range that can be appreciated by both casual Spider-Man fans (Spidey asking ""Should we kiss?"" to a hanging enemy), and fanatics (a mention of ""Nazis made of bees""). There were some nice interactive touches I loved: using the attack buttons around citizens lets you wave and give high fives, with some interactions giving you XP, and J.J. Jameson now hosts a podcast Peter listens to, but you can unsubscribe in the audio settings menu.

Insomniac's representation of the Spider-Man experience plays as good as it looks, at least in its opening hours. The web swinging and acrobatic combat are instantly satisfying, but it's also wonderful to see that there's a lot more to it--a significant focus on interacting as Peter Parker and Mary Jane (which we're hoping will continue to evolve into something great), a depth of progression options and combat abilities, and many minor, but exciting details that positively colored my short experience. The opening hours had me eager to play more--even just to have more time swinging around the city--but it also reinvigorated my excitement about the Marvel universe in general. I just wish I could forget about those towers.","Spider-Man PS4's First Few Hours Have Everything We Want, And Something We Don't"

Speaking of Fortnite, dataminers have uncovered yet more information from the game’s latest patch.

There’s a tonne of new stuff coming to Fortnite (and really, when isn’t there?) including new game modes, cosmetic upgrades and weapons.

The latest rumours suggest we might be seeing two new sniper rifles enter play, along with new game modes which hopefully are going to keep the game as strong as ever.

The game’s developer, Epic Games, has been getting some flack recently after issues with bugs and items having to be pulled from the game came to light.

Playground Mode, shotguns, health items and more have all caused problems within the Fortnite community, so it’s a good thing Epic Games are pretty on the ball when it comes to patches and bug-fixes.

Fortnite is one of the biggest games in the world right now, with the free-to-play game’s Battle Royale mode taking the universe by storm.

Although not without its controversy, fans still can’t get enough of Fortnite. With so many regular updates from Epic Games, it’s hard to imagine this game is going anywhere anytime soon.

"No dates announced. Everyone knows it’s gonna be free to play eventually, everything in this article is just speculation. ",https://www.gamebyte.com/fortnites-save-the-world-will-soon-be-free-for-everyone/,"Fortnite has just turned one year old, celebrating its birthday in style with a party Battle Bus, new challenges and cosmetic goodies which will soon be leaving until (presumably) the game’s second bday.

It’s difficult to remember a time before we’d all experienced the absolute joy of the free-to-play Battle Royale mode which rocketed the game to success.

But despite Fortnite being known as a “free” game, there are still some aspects of it that will expect you to cough up the cash – Save The World, for example.

Epic Games has previous told its many, many fans that Save The World will soon be at the same cost-free status as its Battle Royale mode, but all we knew was that it was a change planned for sometime this year.

Speaking to the Express, Fortnite’s Lead Systems Designer, Eric Williamson commented: “We’re still looking at a 2018 free release for ‘Save the World.’ Epic tried to be really generous with the content in Early Access packs, and there have been events and items that exclusive to this Early Access period already!

“We appreciate everyone who’s played and supported the game so far, and our philosophy is to do everything we can to show that to our players.”

We haven’t heard too much about the potentially free content since Williamson made this statement a few months ago, but as we’re nearly through with 2018, we can imagine we’ll be getting an update on the release sooner rather than later.

There was initially a lot of speculation suggesting that the launch of Season Five of the game could introduce the first cost-free Save The World mode, but that’s yet to happen.

Maybe next season, then?

While we wait there’s still a load of content coming to the game, including new skins, weapons and even a few new modes too.

That should be plenty to tide you over until Save The World is free, right?

"Scarlet. The name is Scarlet. 

(Also, GameByte is trying to get back into clickbait, so, we might have more posting :D )",https://www.gamebyte.com/next-xbox-launching-in-2020-and-its-codename-has-people-talking/,"Gamers believe the successor to the Xbox One could be coming in 2020, and its development name is very unique.

Microsoft confirmed back at E3 this year that work has already begun on the new consoles from Xbox, and the fact that multiple versions of the console are coming has gotten fans very excited.

Now it looks like we’ve got a bit more info on the upcoming console launch, as multiple sources are claiming the consoles are being developed under the codename ‘Scarlett.’

Of course, it’s common practise for consoles to be developed with a name that eventually has nothing to do with the final product, but this hasn’t stopped fans from speculating what the name could mean.

According to reports on other consoles, past codenames have ranged from the sensible to the downright weird, meaning ‘Scarlett’ could just be a Microsoft in-joke, a reference to a game or even just a randomly selected name.

The Wii U was developed under the name ‘Project Café,’ the PlayStation was named ‘Orbis’ and the Xbox One went by ‘Durango.’

In some other exciting news, a report from Thurrott is claiming that ‘Scarlett’ will be launching in 2020.

Writing for Thurrott, Brad Sams says: “This past week, I was tipped off that the next generation Xbox was codenamed Scarlett and in an effort to track down if this information was accurate, I was able to view content that highlighted several unannounced Microsoft products that are coming in the next two years.

“Microsoft is planning for the next Xbox console release to arrive in 2020. But what is more interesting, is that Microsoft describes ‘Scarlett’ as a family of devices; meaning we may see multiple pieces of hardware released that year.

“That date may seem relatively close considering that the Xbox One X launched last year but Microsoft is aggressively moving ahead with hardware in the console space to shake up the industry. But what we don’t know is if this is a brand new set of devices or simply a more ‘powerful’ Xbox One that is again, fully backward compatible with all the content available today.”

EA Sports isn’t the only one in trouble as Bethesda is suing Warner Bros after the latter released a new game that ‘clones’ their Fallout Shelter game, and even uses the same code.

Polygon reports that a suit was filed in a Maryland U.S. District Court. Bethesda alleges that Westworld, developed by Behaviour and released this week for Android and iOS, “has the same or highly similar game design, art style, animations, features and other gameplay elements” as their game.

They continued: “Behaviour breached its contract with Bethesda and utilised its restricted access to Bethesda’s intellectual property, including Bethesda’s copyrighted code, trade secrets, and other rights, to compress its development timeline, reduce costs, and quickly bring the Westworld mobile game to market, and offer players the widely popular gameplay experience found in Fallout Shelter.”

They also reckon that Behaviour used the “same copyrighted computer code” as their own game.

They’re right to be upset, and the situation raises a big question that it seems like no one wants to answer: Why didn’t anyone warn us not to play Fortnite on the PlayStation 4?

The issue is a problem moving in the other direction as well; if you play Fortnite on the Switch, you will not be able to access your account through the PlayStation 4. But very few players have bumped into that issue, as the Switch version of the game was only released earlier today.

The error message that Fortnite gives you when trying to play the game on the Switch after playing on the PlayStation 4 is rather icy, and sounds like Epic Games knew of the issue and wanted to make damn sure you understood that it wasn’t their fault.

“This Fortnite account is associated with a platform which does not allow it to operate on Switch,” the error message states. “Neither the Fortnite website nor Epic Customer Service are able to change this. To play Fortnite on Switch, please create a new account.”

Sony hasn’t gotten back to us. Epic Games gave us a “no comment,” even as the number of angry tweets about this situation pile up. Nintendo also declined to comment on the situation.

Epic Games itself provides a detailed FAQ about cross-platform play which indicates that the Switch and PlayStation 4 versions of the game won’t be able to interact, but nowhere does it say that playing the PlayStation 4 version at all means you can’t use your main account or any of the items you’ve purchased on the Nintendo Switch.

How the hell is this going on for so long without anyone explaining what’s going on? And if any of these companies knew this was going to happen, why were we never warned not to play the game on the PlayStation 4?

This whole thing is bad news for Sony. Despite no official statements about whose decision this was or who is responsible, a quick look around social media indicates that everyone blames Sony for the issue.

It’s not an unreasonable assumption, even if it’s based on speculation. We know Sony has kept companies from offering cross-platform play in the past. We know that Epic Games has made Xbox to PlayStation 4 cross-platform play available on Fortnite in the past. We know that Xbox’s social media team is having a good time dunking on Sony today. Whatever is actually going on, this makes Sony look like a spoiled child.

If Sony isn’t to blame for this situation, an explanation of that fact is hours overdue.

Simply a list of obvious things.,https://www.gamebyte.com/worst-mistakes-everybody-makes-fortnite/,"Fortnite is a great game but some of us can't seem to quite get that elusive victory royale. We are here to help.

We all love to play Fortnite at the moment. The whole world can’t seem to get enough of the 100 man battle royale game. Many of those people, including you reading this, suck. But don’t worry we got you covered. Here is our list of how to improve at Fortnite BR.

Heading Straight to a Big City

The majority of Fortnite players tend to be extra greedy and jump out of the Battle Bus right above the biggest city they see on the map, but this is not such a great idea. In the first few minutes of the game you’ll probably not have enough weapons and ammunition to be able to get into fights with other people and this is why you should avoid heading straight towards a big city; and, instead settle for a more innocuous settlement that is partially deserted so that you can loot the houses at your own pace and without the fear that you’ll get shot at by enemies.

Overlooking Building Materials

We know that Fortnite is the kind of game where you’ll want go in all guns blazing but the end game is usually won by working with a plan in mind, and building structures is the best thing you could do to achieve success. Having a variety of good weapons and plenty of ammo are two very important objectives but building materials will prove to be vital during the stormy nights so you’ll always have to be careful and gather enough household resources if you want to be able to survive in the long run. All in all, in Fortnite, guns are great, but bricks and wood planks will also prove to be very handy in a pinch.



Using the Wrong Weapon

The assault rifle is the best all-around weapon in the entire game and even though you might get so attached to it that you practically glue it to your palms, it would be wise to take the other options that are in your inventory into consideration. For example, a pumpkin launcher, a shotgun and even some explosives will prove to be perfectly viable alternatives that will help you in situations when an assault rifle would probably fail. And here is yet another piece of advice: rapidly switching between weaponry is your definite lifesaving move in Fortnite, so by all means, practice until you become the best gunslinger in the game.

Forgetting to Build

The main advantage you have in Fortnite is that you can build your very own shield wherever you are, so when you get yourself surrounded by enemies and there is no way out, think outside of the box and put together a small shelter that you can get cover in. Forgetting to build useful structures is definitely one of the worst mistakes you could commit while playing this game and if you’re going to watch let’s plays done by well-prepared players you’ll see that they tend to put together buildings more often than they shoot.



Underestimating Sound

When you’re playing fast paced survival games, listening to environmental sounds is vital because in this way you can predict the direction an enemy is approaching from, or you can hear if there is a battle close to you. Thankfully, Fortnite has a very unique sound selection that is not only very easily recognizable but also loud and clear enough to give you all the necessary hints when it comes to engaging into combat with more than just the sense of sight. In conclusion, underestimating sound can turn out to be one of those apparently innocent mistakes that are in fact crucial to the outcome of your gameplay.

Not Sorting Your Inventory

There’s nothing worse than a messy inventory where weapons mix up with building materials, aiding kits and miscellaneous loot and we are not saying this because we are some kind of superior beings who are always tidy, however, in a game like Fortnite, when you need to switch between guns in a matter of seconds, you’ll surely want to not be pointing a piece of wood towards the enemy by mistake. All in all, keeping a clear head as well as a clean inventory are two of the easiest ways of avoiding small yet fatal mistakes that could get you killed.

Dead Space.,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-next-free-pc-game-now-available-and-its-a-good/1100-6456765/,"Dead Space, the acclaimed 2008 sci-fi horror game from the now-defunct developer Visceral Games, is now completely free on PC. It is the newest ""On the House"" game from publisher Electronic Arts, and you can grab it right here from Origin.

As with the previous On the House titles, once you download Dead Space it is yours to keep forever. The only catch is that EA doesn't say when On the House titles cycle out, so if you're interested, you may want to grab the game right now instead of putting it off until later.

Dead Space was already in the Origin Access free game library on PC, so if you subscribe to that service you have been able to play the game at no cost for a while now. The game was also released on Xbox 360, and it is playable on Xbox One through backwards compatibility. The Xbox 360 edition is in the Xbox One EA Access library.

Dead Space was in fact the very first EA On the House freebie, kicking off the freebie campaign back in 2014. It appears to be the first title to have two runs in the On the House hopper.

In Dead Space, you play as a space engineer named Isaac Clarke who must fight all manner of ghastly creatures on a spaceship. Sequels Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3 were released in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey, who now lead Call of Duty studio Sledgehammer Games, worked on Dead Space before starting their own studio.

Dead Space 3 failed to meet EA's sales expectations. However, despite that, the publisher said in 2013 that the brand remains one that is ""close to Electronic Arts' heart."" However, with creator Visceral Games now shuttered, it remains to be seen if the franchise has a future at EA.","Free PC Game From EA Available, And It's A Good One"
"The Viking era. ""Assassin's Creed: Ragnarok"".",https://www.gamebyte.com/next-assassins-creed-could-be-set/,"The Assassins Creed franchise has been all around the world in many different settings. Here is where the franchise could be going next.

New concept art has been released for what might be the next Assassin’s Creed game and it has us wondering where the next Assassin’s Creed could be set.

Where will the next Assassin’s Creed be set?

Let’s look into where the next game could be set within the Assassin’s Creed franchise and see what kind of gameplay content could come from it.

It’s important to remember that the information in this post is so based on speculation and rumors so far, but with newly released concept art, it’s possible that these rumors could come true. If they are true, we could have a very exciting new Assassin’s Creed game on our hands.

Will The Next Assassin’s Creed Be Based On Vikings?

If recent concept art is anything to go by, the next game will be based on the Viking era. The next game has been rumoured to be called Assassin’s Creed: Ragnarok.

With the Viking era potential in mind, there are a lot of questions we have to ask about what gameplay mechanics the new game will have. I’ve tried to find answers to some of these questions below.

The Next Assassin’s Creed Game Will Have Naval Combat

If Ubisoft opt for the Viking setting, adding naval combat would make perfect sense. Naval warfare was always a big part of the Viking lifestyle. Thankfully, we already know that naval combat can work really well in Assassin’s Creed games.

Black Flag is the perfect example of how naval combat and sea exploration can expand on the Assassin’s Creed universe in an exciting new way. I’d absolutely love to see a return to this kind of gameplay in the next Assassin’s Creed game.

If rumours are to be true, you may once again be given the option to commandeer your own ship. Some speculation suggests that you’ll be pitted up against a rival Viking clan and will regularly be put into naval combat situations whilst exploring the deep sea.

Blending Stealth With The Typical Viking Archetype

Whilst Assassin’s Creed games can often be so different from one another, one element always stays the same throughout the franchise.

As the name would suggest Assassin’s Creed always implements some kind of stealth into the gameplay. Typically, you wouldn’t consider a Viking to be particularly stealthy – they’re often looked at as tough, heavy-hitting combatants.

It will be interesting to see how Ubisoft blend the stealth elements of past Assassin’s Creed titles into a Viking style game.

Interestingly, there is some history that suggests Vikings weren’t as brutish as one may think. In the past, Vikings would use a mixture of deceit and stealth to take down their enemies.

One thing that is important to note is that Vikings would often do anything they could to carry out attacks. Vikings were known to be ruthless, but that didn’t mean they were always running in head first to combat. Instead, Vikings were actually smart thinkers that’d use any means possible to get an edge in combat.

Perhaps if the new Assassin’s Creed game was set in the Viking era, we could see a variety of options for players to choose how they want to take out enemies. A variety of improvised weapons alongside different options for stealthy or non-stealthy approaches could be considered.

For when things get really tough, Ubisoft could add some kind of Bezerk combat mode that would make dealing with waves of enemies less challenging.

What Will Be The Backstory For The Next Assassin’s Creed Game?

In past Assassin’s Creed games, there have often been references to religion or the gods in some way or another. Usually, religion has played a big part of the story for past games in the franchise.

During the Viking era, many believed in the Norse gods. Could we some kind of reference to the Norse gods in the backstory for the next Assassin’s Creed game? I think it’s totally possible.

In the past, Vikings would also pillage religious sites and attack places that were particularly vulnerable.

The cause of their ruthlessness was often attributed to honoring a particular Norse god. Many believed that Vikings would attain spiritual powers by honoring the gods in this way, so perhaps there could be some level of this reflected in the next AC game.

What Weapons Will Be In The Next Assassin’s Creed Game?

Weapons are always a big part of Assassin’s Creed, and the Viking era makes a perfect opportunity for Ubisoft to create some truly legendary weapons.

Whilst we’re not sure what kind of unique weapons could be added to the next game, we do know there is likely to be some common Viking weapon archetypes seen throughout.

Here’s a look at some of the weapons you can expect to see if the next Assassin’s Creed game is based on the Vikings.

Battle axes

Perhaps the most iconic Viking weapon is the battle axe. Whilst it’s popular belief that Vikings used the battle axe as their weapon of choice, it was more often used as a tool, for example, for ship building.

Usually, battle axes were only used in combat during Viking raids. It’d be interesting to see a range of different battle axes in the next Assassin’s Creed.

Ubisoft could introduce smaller battle axes useful for taking down enemies silently, longer axes for battering through crowds of enemies, and maybe even throwing axes to take down enemies from a distance.

Spears

The most commonly used Viking weapon was the spear. There were typically two types of spears used – throwing spears and spears for close quarter combat. Both types of spears could fit into an Assassin’s Creed game quite well.

Shields

Many Vikings went without helmets and usually only the wealthiest of Vikings could afford to wear one. However, shields were commonplace. In fact, almost all Vikings had shields. The shields were made out of softwood. This made sure that they were cheap to produce and very expendable.

Summary

Do you think an Assassin’s Creed game set in the Viking era could be good fun? If not, where else do you think the next game should be set?

That's all the article says. Urgh this one annoyed me. ",https://trib.al/dltFz9S,"There are a bunch of interesting weapons in Destiny 2. Auto rifles, rocket launchers, swords, and weirdo reverse-tractor beams. But which guns are best? Here’s our list of the top five.

5. MIDA Multi-Tool

The exotic scout rifle MIDA Multi-Tool is pretty easy to get. It probably has the least stringent requirements of any of Destiny 2’s exotic quests. Once you get it, you’ll have a gun that lives up to its name. It’s got so many uses! Obviously, it’s good at long range. But it staggers enemies really effectively, so it’s solid at close range, too. You really don’t need to use anything else.

4. MIDA Multi-Tool

The best thing about the MIDA Multi-Tool is that it lets you keep your radar active when you aim down your sights. That puts it way above most other guns for PvP, particularly in the more intense modes on the competitive playlist or during Trials of the Nine. Destiny 2 has increased the time it takes for your radar to come back after you aim down the sights of a normal gun, making the MIDA’s radar perk that much more valuable. It’s a no-brainer.

3. MIDA Multi-Tool

There’s plenty of new stuff in Destiny 2, so it’s comforting to use a gun that we’re all already familiar with. MIDA Multi-Tool is one of several Destiny 2 exotics that Bungie carried over from the first game. It’s been floating around the meta since waaaay back in 2014, and it just wouldn’t be Destiny if that weren’t still the case. Sequels are all about using the same guns we’ve been using for three years, right? It’s so nice to stick with what we know.

2. MIDA Multi-Tool

If you’re competing in Trials of the Nine, chances are most of your teammates are going to be using the MIDA Multi-Tool. You wouldn’t want to stick out, right? Of course not! Don’t be a weirdo! You can always equip a good auto rifle in your energy slot, if you really want to use something different from time to time. But let’s be real: if we could have our way, we’d just equip a MIDA Multi-Tool in both slots! We guess that’s what the MIDA Mini-Tool is for.

The MIDA Multi-Tool won our hearts years ago with its iconic “death stapler” firing sound, and we definitely have yet to get sick of it! It’s so refreshing to go into a crucible match and immediately hear that clipped thwack coming from every angle. Why use any other gun when you can use one that sounds this good?

They will Sync faster now. ,https://fraghero.com/playstation-trophies-getting-small-useful-improvement/,"In a recent announcement, Sony informed us that there will be an improvement in trophies. More specifically, the syncing of all the trophies on the PlayStation 4 will be much faster. This means that you won’t have to wait for long for the information to update.

Starting today, Trophies will sync much more quickly so you can brag to your friends as soon as they’re unlocked! 🏆 — PlayStation (@PlayStation) July 5, 2017

Unfortunately, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the differences will be huge. There will still be some kind of delay but this time it will be less than what it was in the past. Although syncing to the server is noticeably faster, it still doesn’t happen automatically like on Xbox One.

Like before, you will need to access the trophy section in the PlayStation menu in order for the syncing of the trophies to launch.

According to PlayStation Europe, the update will make its way on the PS4. However, there was no mention on PlayStation 3 and PS Vita benefiting from the update.

Good news! Your trophies will now sync much quicker than ever before on your PS4, so it’ll be easier to show off your achievements! pic.twitter.com/x0ZgiFu4Wp — PlayStation Europe (@PlayStationEU) July 5, 2017

You have to buy it as a bundle. ,https://gizmodo.com/thinkgeek-is-selling-a-fresh-stash-of-nes-classics-but-1796528902,"If you were one of the many, many sad people who missed out on snagging the NES Classic Edition before Nintendo inexplicably pulled the plug on it, there’s still a chance you can get one without spending hundreds on eBay as ThinkGeek has apparently stumbled onto a massive cache of the consoles.

Update, 3:47 p.m. EST/EDT: Looks like they’re already completely sold out.

Is there a catch? Of course there is. ThinkGeek claims to have thousands of units in stock, courtesy of its parent company GameStop. They’re available for purchase as of 3pm EST today, but while ThinkGeek won’t be selling its NES Classic Editions with as steep a markup as most eBay sellers do, you’ll still only be able to buy the sought after console as part of a bundle with other Nintendo merchandise.

The cheapest bundle, which includes box art, a Legend of Zelda puzzle, and a Piranha plant puppet, pushes the console’s price tag to $140, more than twice what the NES Classic Edition originally cost. Other bundles include collectibles like Zelda shield backpacks and stackable Tetris lamps, but the most expensive option will cost $220 and come with a Mega Man wearable helmet and Proto Man Buster blaster replica. Can you guess which bundle will sell out the fastest?

Where exactly did these unsold units of an unbelievably coveted gadget come from? ThinkGeek and GameStop won’t say. There’s an element of shameless cash grab going on here, but at least the mini consoles will make their way to the hands of fans sitting at their computers right now.

Nintendo has promised to ramp up production for its forthcoming SNES Classic Edition, which brings with it a never-before-released sequel to Star Fox. But Nintendo has a notorious history of releasing hardware with a limited supply to bolster demand (remember the eternal lineups for the Wii?) so you might still have a hard time getting the SNES Classic Edition on launch day in September. But with enough patience hopefully you’ll be able to find one before the holidays make it impossible again.

"They used a program to force a variable to trigger the mission. So not hidden so much as not supposed to be accessible yet. This mission has the player go to a alien ship crash site, steal some eggs and return them to the bunker. ",https://fraghero.com/gta-v-players-trigger-secret-hidden-mission-finds-alien-crash-site-game/,"Recently, some clues emerged that something was going to happen involving the Chiliad mystery.

People had scoured the source code for the Gunrunner update, and found some clues involving Chiliad, aliens, government agents, a busted up spaceship, and more.

Now, the pieces are falling into place. It still required a little ingenuity to trigger the mission:

“Well guys, R* made the trigger for this mission quite hard to work out in the scripts,” via a discussion on the subreddit for the Chiliad Mystery.

“We knew that it all depended on a particular global variable being set to 20… so we just went ahead and forced it to be 20 using a great tool made by polivilas on our discord!! Our very own Guru WetNips managed to force the global and spawn what looks to be just another supply mission, with a twist…”

The twist is that you’re making your way over to a crash-landed UFO, and stealing alien eggs, and taking them back to your bunker while ominous music plays and aliens try to stop you.

Keep in mind, this hasn’t been officially unlocked by Rockstar yet, and is likely part of a future update, so you may want to hold off for the real thing, which will likely tie into something larger with a lot more context. Either way, here’s the video of the mission, check it out:","GTA V players trigger secret hidden mission, find alien crash site in the game"
They did it for fun. ,https://compete.kotaku.com/15-years-later-heres-why-a-gamer-was-duct-taped-to-a-c-1796679499,"Few photos from the forum ages of online gaming live in greater infamy than one of what appears to be a human duct taped to the ceiling of a dimly lit basement, his arms reaching out to lightly graze the keys of a Dell mechanical keyboard.

Many have laid claim to this image. “I was there,” they say. “It was me, I took this photo,” others declared. We reached out to those people—most didn’t respond or couldn’t provide proof. But one thread surfaced: a group of small-town gamers who hauled computers to each other’s houses to play, among other games, Counter-Strike.

The picture in question originates from Mason, Michigan, where a close group of friends who liked to build personal computers and organize LAN parties grew up. Through Reddit and email, we were able to get in touch with a large portion of the group, as well as obtain verification and additional images.

Through all our interviews, members of the group laughed at the claims of Internet fakers and commenters.

“I don’t want to say it’s a closely guarded secret,” said Brian Schaeffer, one of the LAN goers. “But half the fun of seeing that picture pop up on the internet is all the stories where people say, ‘Oh yeah I know the people there.’ No you don’t! It was a small town, a random group of friends, and we literally just got goofy one day.”



The group told me they would hang out together in various houses and, sometimes, even a tire warehouse, lugging computer rigs to locations to play a variety of games. It was the summer of 2002, and at the time, Counter-Strike was the game to play. Others recount games like Command & Conquer, both Renegade and Red Alert 2, as well as Battlefield 1942 (for those with the 512 MB RAM to run it) and StarCraft custom games. Counter-Strike was the great equalizer. It could run on just about anything, and everyone had it.

For the Mason alumni, the night they taped Drew Purvis to the ceiling was just an average day, another LAN party with friends.

“It was still early in the day and the LAN had already become fractured,” said Nick Wellman, another LAN goer. “There were about 10 of us there, and we were already playing three, four different games. Tyler was looking around and said, ‘I think you can duct tape someone to that I-beam.’”

At this point, the teens gathered the necessary supplies, bought duct tape on a friend’s employee discount and had the tallest attendee, Brian, hold the subject, Drew, aloft while the rest taped him up.

What you see in the now-iconic photo is actually the group’s second attempt to suspend their friend from the ceiling with duct tape. After about 10 minutes, the tape digging into his sides, Drew asked to be cut down. They revised their plan, adding pillows, and strapped him back up. Once on the beam, someone else had the idea to stack some tables up so Drew could still play on his computer.

“That is the funniest part about the picture,” Nick told us. “Gaming from the beam was a complete afterthought.”

Advertisement

Drew lasted about two hours suspended above his comrades before retiring to the ground (turns out a duct tape cocoon runs hot).

Brian, who happened to bring along his digital camera from photography class that day, saved some snapshots to commemorate the moment. Drew posted the photos to a gaming forum, where it would stay duct-taped to the memories of gamers for all eternity. (We reached out to Drew for this story, and made contact, but he didn’t get back to us in time before publishing.)

“We tried to keep a list of all the places we saw the picture pop up, but it just kept started showing up in more and more places,” said Brian. “It also speaks to how when something’s on the internet, it’s always going to be up there, you can’t hide it.”

Advertisement

For the Mason alumni, it’s a little reminder of a simpler time.



“It’s so funny, because if you see the Reddit threads, every time this picture goes around every couple years it’s like a little Mason reunion,” said Jonathan Watrous, another LAN-goer.

Advertisement

Those mini-reunions in the comment sections of this picture help keep the group together and caught up, long after it splintered and scattered to the wind. Some still try to get together, either online through modern games like League of Legends or in-person.

“Not quite LAN parties,” said Brian of recent Mason get-togethers. “We’ve done some of those, but we’re all adults. Dragging the rigs around aren’t quite as easy as it was back then, and we’re all adults now, too. We had more time back then.”

The photo remains an indelible reminder of a time when rigs were dragged into basements and parents were kept awake by the mechanical clacking of keys to the cadence of Counter-Strike.

“I don’t see most of the people in the picture all that often, but this was before smartphones and ubiquitous social media,” said Nathan Gamber, another LAN attendee. “So it’s one of the few moments in that time that we’re reminded of every couple years.”","15 Years Later, Here's Why A Gamer Was Duct-Taped To A Ceiling"
If they can make the remaster look 'great'. ,https://fraghero.com/rockstar-is-open-to-remastering-gta-games-but-only-if-this-condition-is-met,"Take-Two Interactive spoke in detail about a lot of things during a recent investor call and it shared some details regarding Rockstar Games’ policy about doing remastered versions of old Grand Theft Auto titles such as San Andreas and GTA III. (Take-Two Interactive owns Rockstar Games.)

The company made it clear that it’s not adverse to the idea but it isn’t overly eager to do it either. It’ll only pursue such opportunities if it’s confident that it can make the remaster look ‘great‘,

Take-Two Interactive’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, explained in detail about its approach to GTA remasters when asked if games such as Vice City and GTA III might ever make it to current gen consoles.

He assured people that this was something “[Rockstar Games] will decide in due course,” but warned that it “wouldn’t do anything that’s not going to look great creatively.”



The starting point is, ‘Is this going to delight customers, is this going to look good?’. “You know that we’re a company that is not driven first and foremost by ‘Can we create revenue this way?’ We would start by saying, ‘Will this be exciting to consumers, will they be happy with it, will it reflect well on our brand, will it reflect well on our company?’ And if the answer is yes, then it may well be a compelling opportunity. But if the answer is indifferent or no then even if we have an opportunity to make a few bucks we probably would decline. I think that’s the lens through which we look, the actual decisions are made by the labels [Rockstar and 2K].

It’s clear from his statement that Rockstar Games would do justice to any Grand Theft Auto remasters, if they decide to do them. It might eventually happen if fans really want it but don’t expect Take-Two to dive into it for some quick and easy money as they value the GTA brand too dearly to pull off such gimmicks.

Take-Two also delighted fans by revealing that Rockstar Games is currently working on Red Dead Redemption 2, so there’s plenty to look forward to.",Rockstar is open to remastering GTA games but only if this condition is met
"No. But it is a good idea to have access to a second OS.
",http://www.game-debate.com/news/22991/opinion-is-it-time-to-say-goodbye-to-windows-and-use-a-different-operating-system,"Computer hardware is constantly evolving, and so too do operating systems (OS). Roughly nine years ago, Windows XP Service Pack 3 was released. I wouldn't hesitate to consider it a major driving force which let people to mass adoption of PCs in a manner we hadn't seen before. Since then, the operating systems have evolved rapidly. Nowadays, we can really choose which operating system to use, and people are slowly starting to explore other options than vanilla Windows. This may be caused by dissatisfaction with the current Windows 10 situation; uncertainty about upgrading from whatever OS they are using right now, or just out of curiosity to try something different.

Most people buy devices with pre-installed Windows or use Windows because they have been using it all the time. It's not a coincidence the latest Windows 10 concerns only about 26% of desktop market share (Windows OSes together take about 90% of all desktop OSes market share), but is it really the unquestionably best OS to go for right now, or are there other ""usable"" options? Can we use different operating systems, or even live without Windows completely?

It may sound strange, but in order to answer such a question, we need to truly understand what an operating system does and why do we need it. An operating system manages computer hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs. All computer programs (excluding firmware) require an operating system to function. It acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware (although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function). To put it simply, the OS is our computer essential software servant designed to let us use our programs, play games and make use of the fancy gear we have. It should be easy to use, safe and reliable. These are its specific purposes.

So, we could get a quick conclusion right away, that whatever OS matches those demands above is a great OS to use, right? Well, it's not that simple. There's a lot more to consider. For example, graphical user interface (GUI) design defines ""ease of use"" and additional features are often seductive, but do those actually matter?

Windows, OS(X) and Linux are major players at OS market, so allow me to sum up some of the major pros and cons found in each.

Microsoft Windows

Introduced over 30 years ago, it has matured and spread to become the #1 globally recognise OS brand. Microsoft ensured most of the hardware manufacturers and software developers can rely on Windows, and that Windows can rely on them. This makes life for us, the end users, fairly easy. Microsoft offers only a few software products, Microsoft Office and Skype are practically the only ones, with Internet Explorer and Edge being part of Windows itself. Hardware products by Microsoft were practically non-existent until recently, when Microsoft launched the Surface device family (Book, Laptop, Pro, Studio). Everything else is third-party software and hardware.

Cons about Windows include system-wide vulnerability to malware, gradual congestion of the OS, registry bloating, user profile corruption, complicated (un)installing of software/hardware and updates, relatively high resource usage (CPU/RAM/disk) which may often cause perceived slower response times. Last but not least, it's fairly expensive by default - Windows 10 Pro download version costs about $325 / £220 on Microsoft's website, which isn't an insignificant amount of money considering it's the price for which GTX1060 cards are being sold in my country. There are cheaper resellers out there, but they come with their own associated risks.

Meanwhile, the recent launch of Windows 10 S indicates that the future of Windows may be as a subscription-based as-a-service closed ecosystem fully relying on UWP Store apps, which definitely isn't something people will easily adopt. This may be a serious game changer, and may mean that what we know as Windows nowadays will cease to exist entirely.

Apple Mac OS(X)

Released even before Windows, Apple's Macintosh System Software the became first ever successful graphical-based operating system. Apple ensured only very limited hardware configurations are supported, providing own Apple-branded devices (Macbook Air/Pro, iMac, Mac Pro). This helps devs to optimise software and hardware more precisely which results in better stability and more optimised resource usage. Apple provides a complete set of software, including audio and video editors (iMovie, GarageBand, or higher-end Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X) and many others.

Cons about OS(X) are actually very few, but they are major - OS(X) is available to Apple devices only (although it's possible to make custom 'Hackintosh' on non-certified hardware, which requires some fiddling and isn't supported by Apple); the second major problem is a lack of games and software for this platform - some devs release their software for multiple platforms, but the majority of games are relying on Microsoft's DirectX and other Microsoft's APIs, which obviously means no support outside of Windows. Also, it's worth mentioning OS(X) and updates are ""free"", provided only with Apple hardware - which in itself is multiple times more expensive compared to computers and laptops designed for Windows, and although they don't age quite so badly, they still become old and weak sooner or later.

Linux

At first, let's point out Linux itself is NOT an operating system, but a kernel, which needs to be bundled with additional components - those bundles are called 'distributions' or simply 'distros', of which the most popular are Ubuntu, Mint and Fedora. There are hundreds of distros to pick from, and practically all (aside from a few enterprise-targeted support-covered distros) are FREE. Yes, you read that right - entirely free, and usually also free to modify. Also worth mentioning is the fact most distros can be run from a USB stick, even without installation, so they're very easy to try out without messing with whatever OS is installed as the primary.

Cons are similar as those of OS(X), representing a minority of market share, there aren't too many software and hardware devs actively supporting and developing their products for Linux, and so the variety of available software is very limited. There aren't many vendors selling Linux computers, so common practice is to buy Windows-targeted hardware and just run Linux on it - which sometimes may be tricky. Some distros are designed with ease of use in mind, but generally, Linux installations require a moderate degree of computer knowledge and patience to make them work fine.

Conclusion

Although those systems differ a lot, I would say that a major decision point is software and hardware compatibility - the best I can recommend is to try multiple OSes and decide what is needed and what's not. The worst we can do is passively ignore the fact Windows is no longer the only choice nowadays, although it's true Windows 10 is likely to remain the platform for AAA games and so probably the most hassle-free for gamers... for now.

Is it time to say goodbye to Windows? Not yet, but why not have an alternative OS available in case a broken update makes your primary OS unbootable and you'll need to use your PC or access your files?

I tested plenty of Linux distros during the past few years, then about half year ago started using OS(X) El Capitan just out of curiosity (Hackintosh successful), leaving Windows 7 installed alongside, and I realized all software I use is multiplatform and of the little free time left to play games, I can play most of those on OS(X) directly. No longer being dependent on Windows, I don't think I even booted Windows 7 on my rig during the past six months. And although I really enjoy exploring Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB version on another rig, I am happy to have stable, reliable OS(X) on my primary workstation. I'm planning to try out some decent Linux distros, maybe Chrome OS, to replace Windows on my ancient HTPC rig in living room later as well.

What are your thoughts on current operating system options? Do you feel dependent on OS you're using now? Would you consider to test out something new or you don't have time to waste learning entirely different environment?

They reinstated OpenIV - basically means GTA players can mod again. ,https://fraghero.com/rockstar-games-comes-rescue-angry-gta-v-players/,"About a week and a half ago, Take Two Interactive, and by extension, Rockstar Games, did the unthinkable- they banned the largest modding tool available in GTA V, OpenIV.

Understandably, the community was outraged. The Rockstar Games and GTA V forums were alight with the righteous fury of modders around the world. The Steam rating for GTA V went from a very respectable “Mostly Positive” to “Overwhelmingly Negative” over the course of just a few days. It looked like the end of one of the biggest online communities in both console and PC gaming.

Supposedly, Take Two shut down OpenIV because some of the mods that were developed specifically for the single player mode had made their way over to GTA Online, “ruining” the integrity of the game. After the shutdown, all seemed lost. It looked like the era of GTA V’s online dominance was coming to a close.

But then- a hero emerged.

Rockstar Games was able to talk down its parent company, Take Two, and get the OpenIV system reinstated in GTA V.

That’s right, OpenIV is back up.

Rockstar remained very quiet during this entire ordeal, and only gave neutral, polite responses to any questions asked. Based on their abnormal behavior, it seems as if Take Two took the reins and shut down OpenIV against the will of Rockstar’s GTA V teams. Thankfully, the hard-working crew at Rockstar was able to save OpenIV, and by extension, all of the mods made in the 3 and a half years that the game has been out and, by extension, GTA V itself.",Rockstar Games Comes to the Rescue of Angry GTA V Players

",https://fraghero.com/ready-play-games-directly-eyeball/,"The future is officially here, ladies and gentlemen.

The government of South Korea has just approved a patent for Samsung’s latest futuristic technological advancement– smart contact lenses. Samsung’s patent puts them on a level playing field with tech giant Google, which has 2 patents for similar hardware.

The contact lenses, which will project images directly onto the eye of the user, will be used as augmented reality hardware. The possibilities with this sort of technology are nearly endless. For example, Samsung’s (or Google’s) smart contacts could show you the outdoor temperature when you look outside. When partnered with GPS apps like Google Maps or Waze, these smart contacts could act as a real-life heads up display like you see in videogames like Forza Motorsport.

On top of these daily uses, smart contacts open up a plethora of possibilities for surgeons, first responders, and tons of other professionals. Surgeons could have “x-ray vision” that would assist them with surgery, along with live vital monitoring HUD’s. First responders could have information given to them via their contacts as situations transpire.

Oh, and don’t forget the gaming possibilities. Remember Pokemon Go? It was pretty cool on phones, but imagine how amazing it would be if you could see the Pokemon without having to look through your phone. Augmented reality games would finally gain the support and popularity they’ve been trying to get for years.

If $40 feels steep, wait until you hear the rest of the news…

The “Variety Map Pack” which was originally included for the low, low price of free will now also cost an additional $15.

In GTA V’s highly anticipated Gunrunner update, players have found some code that hints at a solution to the epic Chiliad Mystery, one of the most intriguing little “side quests” in the game that ultimately leads you to the top of a mountain in the early morning to see a UFO. This mystery has spawned all sorts of crazy theories, and it seems like things may finally be getting resolved a whole four years later.

You'll still have to put in the Infinite Warfare disk. ,https://fraghero.com/theres-bad-news-already-copy-modern-warfare-remastered/,"The bad news just keeps piling up. After an earlier announcement regarding Activision’s re-release of Modern Warfare: Remastered separate from Infinite Warfare, Activision gave us even more to be upset about.

Despite the fact that Modern Warfare: Remastered will be re-released as a standalone title, gamers who don’t buy the new version will still be tethered to their copy of Infinite Warfare. That’s right, even though the game will be released separately, gamers who have already purchased Infinite Warfare + Modern Warfare: Remastered will not be gifted a separate virtual copy of the game. Instead, they’ll still have to put the Infinite Warfare disc in their console every time they want to play Modern Warfare.

On top of that, the earlier statement from Activision regarding the standalone re-release of Modern Warfare remastered contained even more bad news for gamers. The game will cost fans $40 (a ridiculous amount for a re-release of a remaster) and it won’t even include the $15 of DLC that have been released so far. That puts the price tag for the new version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered to $55.

It’s very possible that Activision made this poorly received decision as a smart business move- there are probably quite a few gamers out there that will buy the re-release plus DLC just so they can get rid of the Infinite Warfare disc.

This new Nintendo Switch accessory solves two very different problems.

Developed by Nyko, the Nintendo Switch Intercooler has an August release date and will be available for $29.99.

The Intercooler increases the airflow to the Nintendo Switch, which should prevent instances of bending and warping.

"You're all all gamers, you've heard of these features before. Examples: connect a keyboard, connect your phone, play cross platform, connect an external hard drive...

P.s. I don't even own an Xbox and I knew all these features.",https://fraghero.com/10-things-didnt-know-xbox-one/,"Gone are the days when consoles were just simple boxes that had an On or Off Button. Nowadays they are transformed into complex machines that feature all kinds of interesting characteristics, social aspects and online connectivity meant to make the gameplay even more enjoyable than before. If you are curious about what your Xbox One packs inside, here are 10 of the most interesting things you didn’t know your favorite console could do.

Connect a Keyboard



Connecting a keyboard to your Xbox One might seem like an unintuitive thing to do since the whole point of using a console is sitting back and relaxing on the sofa with the controller in hand. But there are situations when such an option might come in handy, for example: a case where you want to write a message to a friend. Even though you might not use this feature on a daily basis, it’s still good to know that it exists on the Xbox One.

Customize your Dashboard

If you’ve gotten bored with the standard look of your home screen you’ll be glad to know that you can actually change various little things to make it more personal. By opening the “Settings” application and selecting the Personalization tab you will be able to access “My color & background” section where you’ll find various options. The background can be switched to any color you want and, in addition, you can even opt to use personal pictures, achievement art or a screenshot that you’ve taken.

Use your Phone as a Controller



For those moments when you get extra comfortable and sink into your couch after a long day of work, there’s nothing worse than realizing that the controller is way out of your reach. Luckily, it turns out that you can control your Xbox One directly through your smartphone or tablet, you just have to install a specific app for iOS or Android, log into your account and you’re good to go. This is a useful feature your Xbox one has and it would be a shame not to take advantage of it.

Customize the Controller



For ease of use or just because you like a certain configuration of the buttons, you can easily customize your controller by opening the Xbox Accessories application and playing with the adjustable settings you find there. After you’ve selected the “Configure” option, you’re free to rearrange the buttons in any manner you like and think fits your style best, because it’s very important to be able to handle your controller in the most comfortable of ways.

Broadcast Play Sessions



This option is especially useful for the aspiring streamers or YouTubers out there who want to show the entire world their prowess in playing video games. All you need to do is download the Twitch application, sign in and select the “Broadcast” option, then it will be automatically snapped to the right side of your screen and you can name it and tweak its settings. It’s good to know that such a feature is available on the Xbox One because it really makes many gamers’ life easier.

Add an External Hard Drive



In terms of usefulness, this option really tops it all. Adding an external hard drive to your Xbox One is one of the best things you can do with your console, because once you’ve ran out of the native 500GB space you’ll no longer have to delete the games or videos you’ve got in your collection. By simply connecting an external storage device to one of the USB ports available, you’ll be gaining a lot of new space to install the newest gaming titles on.

Share Games with your Friends



If you set your Xbox One as your “home” Xbox, all the other accounts that are linked to the system gain access to your games, even when you are not logged in. In this way, individual users are able to set up their own save files and earn personal achievements without affecting the game progression of the other members that use the same console. In the same way, if a friend is willing to set their “home” as your house, then both of you will have access to each other’s games for ever.

Use your Xbox One on a Win 10 PC



Once you’ve setup your Xbox One on your home network you are able to access it from any PC that runs Windows 10, so if you find yourself sitting at your desk and feeling the need to play some games that you have on your console, you can access it in a very simple way. You just have to open up the app in Windows and your Xbox One will be instantly turned on, allowing you to access your game library and choose whatever you’d like to play.

Play Cross-Platform



The dream scenario where you can play video games with your friends even if they are using a different system has finally come true. Now you can enjoy an online match with your mates thanks to the cross-platform feature that allows you to get together with PC users. Important titles like Gears of War 4, Killer Instinct, and Rocket League all let you play cooperatively or competitively against your friends, which is downright extraordinary!

Film Yourself in Green Screen videos



Upload Studio is the official video editor offered by Xbox One and even though it’s a free software, it’s surprisingly resourceful and has a lot of cool features to offer. Besides the usual ones that let you edit your gameplay clips into videos, this editor also has a powerful Kinect feature, namely it lets you record yourself as if you had a green screen setup. This is an extraordinary perk, taking into consideration the fact that most of us don’t have a designated green screen setup in our homes.",10 Things You Didn’t Know Your Xbox One Could Do

This topic came up due to the forced split-screen in A Way Out (Even when playing online), which requires more processing power.

In an interview with Engadget, the director of A Way Out, Josef Fares, said that the PS4 isn’t as powerful as people think it is, and that it’s holding back game development.

These comments have some console gamers upset to the point of wanting to boycott this game and the previous title he directed, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. That seems a bit extreme. If you’re not interested in the game, that’s one thing. If you were interested until he compared the PS4 to a 5 year old PC, you might want to reconsider.

It’s an odd comment to make, either way. The PS4 came out in 2013 and it’s 2017 now so the console itself is nearly 5 years old. Also, the average PC gamer isn’t playing on a bleeding edge system and a mid range PC from a few years ago isn’t going to be worlds different from a current generation console in terms of what they can play.. It does stand to reason that developers aren’t going to go balls to the walls to max out high-end gaming PCs with their games when most people won’t be able to play those games, but to attribute a lack of innovation to the hardware limits on consoles seems strange as well.","A Way Out dev hits out at the PS4, makes terrible comparison"

The Nintendo Switch games list could be boosted by Rockstar's next release, and we're not talking about Red Dead Redemption.

New reports have suggested that LA Noire might be getting a re-release on Nintendo Switch, PS4 and Xbox One.

The rumours emerged earlier this year, when Yan2295 told Twitter followers to expect a remaster of the open-world detective game.

""According to what I heard, Rockstar might be releasing a remastered version of L.A. Noire on the Nintendo Switch.""

This was followed by a separate tweet which suggested LA Noire would also hit Xbox One and PS4 this summer.

""Regarding LA Noire Remaster, the title is sounding like it'll come to Switch, PS4, and Xbox One. Release slated for late summer.""

Bounces off the water and explodes a few seconds later in the air. ,https://fraghero.com/gta-v-player-fires-rocket-into-pool-and-gets-the-most-unexpected-result-ever/,"All games have their weird flaws, and this physics bug in GTA V is no exception. As seen in the GIF below, RPGs behave strangely after the player shoots them into water. The character shoots the water with the rocket, but instead of just detonating or staying underwater like a torpedo, the rocket kind of bounces off the surface then careens into the air, exploding after a few seconds.

Weird, right?

GTA V, like GTA IV, runs on the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE). RAGE is a vast improvement over the engine Rockstar used for GTA III – Vice City Stories games. However, as with all physics engines, it does have bugs (as seen above). Rockstar actually updated RAGE with improved water and underwater physics for GTA V, believe it or not. Even though the probability of weird stuff like this happening is lower with the current version of RAGE than it was before, unexplainable video game phenomena can still happen.

However the $500 price tag has raised a few questions about the target audience of the console.

Xbox head Phil Spencer, in a recent interview with Metro admitted that the new console is sort of targeted at the hardware fanatics but not at the base audience. He also added that Xbox One S will sell more that Xbox One X because most of the gamers are not interested in 4K or teraflops.

He said, “We have two consoles in our line: Xbox One S, now for sale for $249 in the US, and Xbox One X, the most powerful console to date. And the majority of consoles we will sell next year will be the S. There’s no doubt about that. Because most of most of the people will say, ‘I just want a console that plays the games I wanna play.’ Our Xbox One S will sell the most because most people are not into how many [teraflops] does this have versus someone else. Most people just want to go play games. And the breadth of games we showed was critical to me, for young and old, male and female. I wanted to make sure we had a great cross section, because at the end of the day the majority of people just wanna buy a console, put a controller in their hands, and play games they’re gonna enjoy.”

This could sound a bit surprising because they have just launched a super powerful console but Spencer does have a point. He went to say that most of the gamers don’t even care about framerate.

“Developers are incentivized to give you the best experience they can. We can both agree on that. So, if they think it’s 60fps and that’s gonna help them, in terms of selling more copies of the game, they’re gonna be all in. But not everybody understands what 60fps vs. 30fps means.”

The leak has also revealed that the game would be priced at $39.99 and will release on June 27th, which is a week after its initially proposed date of June 20th. However, no information has been provided on whether the game will release for PS4 only or will also come for Xbox One and PC.

Seth Rollins. ,http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/wwe-2k18-cover-announcement/,"

It seems like everyone in WWE has a big honkin’ announcement this week. Roman Reigns is supposed to make a SummerSlam announcement on Monday’s Raw, and all weekend Seth stinkin’ Rollins was talking about his big stinkin’ announcement on Monday morning’s SportsCenter. Many suspected the announcement would be that Rollins will be the stinkin’ cover athlete for WWE 2K18. And you know what? That stinkin’ thinkin’ was correct.

Rollins will grace the cover of WWE 2K18, which will be his first time as a WWE video game cover athlete. The cover spot isn’t quite as big a deal as in, say, any other sport, but it’s still a nice little feather in the cap of whichever wrestler gets the spot. The other games in the 2K series have had covers featuring Brock Lesnar, John Cena, Steve Austin, and The Rock, so that’s fine company for Rollins. (And the secret alternate Daniel Bryan cover, but we don’t talk about that one.)

However, it seems that the release date of the game has finally been found out after a video which was deleted later in the official PlayStation channel leaked the date. The release date of the game is listed as December 29, 2017 in the video.

Here is a screen grab from the video:

The video showed every announced game and each of them came with a release window except Detroit Become Human, which was mentioned as ‘In development for PS4’. Days Gone was the only game which came with a particular release date, so this could easily be a mistake.

"If you break the console, your saves are lost. Nintendo said they ""can’t say there’s a solution coming, but we do hear the message"" ",https://fraghero.com/nintendo-switch-critical-problem-nintendo-refuses-fix/,"The Nintendo Switch has got off to a great start but it’s suffering from a major problem: if you’re unfortunate enough to break the device, all your save files will die with it.

This means if you’ve invested a considerable amount of time playing games such as “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” and happen to break the console, all your progress will be lost forever.

The Nintendo Switch has a far greater chance of being broken too, for one it’s a portable home console, and it is also aimed at young gamers, making it all the more susceptible to accidental drops.

Nintendo is the only company that hasn’t been able to come up with a way to secure your save files in case of the console being broken. Both Sony and Microsoft has figured out a simple way: cloud saves. This means your game save files are all stored in a cloud server and can be easily retrieved in case you need to use a new device.

For reasons best known to Nintendo, it neither allows you to save your progress on a cloud server nor does it allow you to back up your save files to a microSD card. Weird.

What’s even worse is the fact that Nintendo seems to be dodging this serious issue. Reggie-Fils-Aime gave a bizarre response when asked about the same:

I can’t say there’s a solution coming, but we do hear the message

Not to mention Bethesda’s latest modding issues.

But not even Rockstar, one of the more historically beloved devs, is safe from the backlash after Take-Two issued a cease and desist letter to the people behind OpenIV, the most prominent modding platform for Grand Theft Auto V. OpenIV didn’t impact GTA Online, it was simply single player mods for the game, which countless people had invested thousands of hours into creating to share with members of the community.

Take-Two’s legal team messaged the creator of OpenIV and claimed they were breaking laws. The lead dev couldn’t figure out what laws they could be breaking, and requested more information and clarification on the matter. Radio silence for weeks, and then Take-Two issued the cease and desist. Here’s a statement that Rockstar issued to PC Gamer:

“Take-Two’s actions were not specifically targeting single player mods. Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players.”

This doesn’t impact the majority of players of the game, but it’s definitely a slap in the face to some of the most hardcore and dedicated players, and even people who play on consoles or don’t use OpenIV to mod the game are standing up and sharing in the outrage. Freely modding games you own has been a cornerstone of PC gaming culture since the very beginning, with many mods turning into full, and very successful, retail releases.

Since news of this broke a couple of days ago, reviews for GTA on Steam have been getting absolutely slammed.

In the past 30 days, there have been 27,060 reviews of the game and only 18% are positive, and the positive ones are presumably from before this whole ordeal went down, which leaves the recent score for GTA V at “Overwhelmingly Negative.”

A minimum of 100gb. ,https://fraghero.com/forza-motorsport-7-takes-up-an-ridiculous-amount-of-hard-drive-space/,"Forza 7 is one of the most anticipated games of the year and Microsoft will try to showcase Xbox One X’s 4K capabilities with the game. The game will run in true 4K which is 60 frames per second. However, one thing that could be a worry for the gamers with this amazing upcoming game is the required hard drive space.

In order to install the game you will need a hard drive space of 100 GB at minimum on both PC and Xbox One X. The game has an surprisingly enormous size even though it contains Ultra HD assets. So, if you are planning to get this game you will have to make sure that you empty some of your hard drive space.

In case you have a 500 GB hard drive you’ll need to save almost 1/5th of the entire storage for the game and if the game gets any expansion soon it is bound that it will need half of your storage.

Forza 7 is one of the biggest games in terms of file size ever. Next in line would be Gears of War 4 which consumes upto 120 GB of space but only after downloading all the patches. Halo 5 also needs around 100 GB after all of its patches being downloaded.

So, if you are short on hard drive space the game might cause problems.

Because it reminded him of his old tragedies. ,https://fraghero.com/god-of-war-dev-reveal-why-kratos-has-an-axe-instead-of-the-blades-of-chaos-in-the-new-game/,"While everyone was wondering why the classic Blades of Chaos of Kratos has been replaced by a new ax weapon, the game’s director has revealed the real reason behind it.

During his interview with Games Radar, director Cory Barlog mentioned that the classic chained dual blades were intentionally ditched by Kratos because they reminded him of his old tragedies in his life. Barlog also went on to discuss about the new primary weapon to be used by Kratos.

He said, “We were experimenting with lots of different weapons, lots of different things. I think we wanted to create an identity, because to me the blades represent a very dark time in [Kratos’] life. They are not just a weapon to him. They are his scarlet letter. They are the marking that somebody tricked him, that he made a bad deal, that he made a mistake. Powerful, but I think also powerfully charged in its emotion. So I think of part of him wanting to move forward is being able to [leave the blades behind].”

Barlog also teased the gameplay mechanics of the ax during the interview. Kratos will now be able to throw the ax, stick it to a particular place and even recall it back. One of the interesting mechanics of the ax would be to throw it behind the enemies and then recall it back such that it hits them during its return.

No. It costs just over $150 dollars more than the XBox 1X (prices are as current as June 15th and even the final build doesn't run as well as a console according to the article) ,http://www.pcworld.com/article/3200767/gaming/xbox-one-x-pc-build.html,"Microsoft’s Xbox One X presents an interesting challenge for PC builders. Sure, if you want raw power, nothing beats the PC. But putting together an Xbox One X equivalent for the same $500 price is tricky.

In ideal conditions, that price point already pushes the limits of what’s possible, particularly outside of the golden window of Black Friday sales and stellar combo/bundle deals on PC components. But we remain in the middle of inflated prices for RAM and certain GPUs, as well as a dearth of 4K UHD drives. Faithfully replicating Microsoft’s console doesn’t come out cleanly in favor of a DIY PC.

Still, it’s a worthwhile endeavor—so we’ve not only updated the prices for our two sample builds from June, but we’ve also added a new one using a Ryzen 3 CPU. Moreover, we’ve built an Xbox One X PC. In fact, we built two based on our part lists, and then benchmarked them.

Let’s jump right into the details.

Editor’s note (11/7/2017): This article was originally published on June 16, 2017. The latest update includes our benchmarks of the Xbox One X PC we built live on November 2nd.

Build #1: A basic 4K/30-fps gaming PC

To start, we’ll walk through a baseline build, which makes a few sacrifices but should still perform at 4K/30 fps.

Build notes

Prices current as of October 26, 2017. Retailers chosen with shipping costs in mind—and the assumption most people have an Amazon Prime account. Cheap motherboards like the Gigabyte GA-970A-DS3P FX lack on-board Wi-Fi, so if you want wireless connectivity, prepare to shell out for either a Wi-Fi adapter or a better motherboard. See the Build Summary section for notes on cost. This price is after a $3 coupon discount plus a $15 mail-in rebate.

Build breakdown

When comparing our build to the Xbox One X piece by piece, each platform’s advantages are clear. Our PC has more flexibility and muscle, while the Xbox One X is both highly compact and set in stone.

For the Xbox One X’s CPU, GPU, and memory, Microsoft chose a custom AMD APU that features eight 2.3GHz custom x86 cores, 40 Radeon compute units running at 1,172MHz, and 12GB of GDDR5 memory. AMD doesn’t have an equivalent APU available for DIY builds, so I chose to walk the line between the Xbox One X’s specs and recommended specs for a smooth PC gaming experience. In our build is the eight-core 3.3GHz AMD FX-8300, 8GB of DDR3/1600 RAM, and an 8GB Radeon RX 580. (My GPU choice does have one catch, which I’ve noted in the Build Summary below.)

This configuration nets you a (faster) eight-core CPU, enough RAM to avoid performance bottlenecks, and a GPU capable of 4K gaming at a minimum of 30 fps on Medium settings. (See below for our actual benchmark results.) However, some Xbox One X games may end up running more smoothly or with better visual fidelity on console than on this homebrew 4K machine. Unlike with the PC, developers can fine-tune their games for Microsoft’s console through a low-level API.

For storage, Microsoft hadn’t made the drive speed, type, and interface explicitly clear when I initially put together this parts list. All we knew at the time was what Digital Foundry revealed in its April 2017 preview: The Xbox One X will have a “1TB hard drive with a 50 percent increase in bandwidth.”

I could have spent a lot of time speculating on what that quotation meant: Perhaps it’s a shift from SATA II/3Gbps to SATA III/6Gbps? Use of a solid-state hybrid drive? A larger cache? Instead I chose to keep this exercise simple and selected a SATA III 7,200rpm Western Digital hard drive.

Since then, I’ve had readers tell me that Microsoft is indeed using a 7,200rpm drive in the Xbox One X. (Thus dashing any hopes that the Xbox One X’s $500 price tag includes a SSHD, like in its now-discontinued Xbox One Elite model.) However, when I recently looked up Xbox One X teardowns, I saw a part number on the Seagate hard drive that actually indicates a 5,400rpm drive (ST1000LM035).

With that mystery still unresolved, I stand by my original decision to pick a 7,200rpm for simplicity’s sake. It’s as cheap, if not cheaper than a 5,400rpm drive, and it’ll run at SATA III/6Gbps assuming your motherboard supports it. Some AM3+ boards don’t, so if you go with this FX-8300 build, keep that in mind.

The final pieces of this build are straightforward. In fact, you can use any reputable 500W power supply (the minimum for this build), ATX case, and Blu-Ray drive. The ones listed in our build were chosen for how cheap they were at the time of publication.

Speaking of that Blu-Ray drive, it’s a far step down from the Xbox One X’s 4K UHD Blu-Ray drive. To stay even remotely near a final total of $500, you have to ditch support for playback of 4K UHD discs. So that means you can’t play your collection of 4K UHD movies in HDR on a compatible TV, if you already own one.

As for the operating system, we can’t go as cheap as the Xbox One X’s included variant of Windows 10, but we can get a W10 Home license at a heavy discount. How? By using a trick that Brad Chacos has mentioned to our staff for a while now: Buying a product key through Kinguin. It works, but be sure to get the Buyer Protection—the site functions like an eBay for software, and that insurance will protect you from shady sellers.

Build summary

You can’t do an exact 1:1 duplicate of an Xbox One X, thanks to a mix of Microsoft’s custom hardware design and slow release of specs. This build is a fairly decent compromise between Xbox One X’s main features and the cost of PC components. It runs games in 4K at a minimum of 30 fps on a Medium graphics setting, supports HDR, and plays optical discs.

However, it’s more expensive than an Xbox One X by $212 (or more, if you’re bad about filing mail-in rebates). It lacks support for 4K UHD Blu-Ray discs. It uses a GPU that’s still inflated in price, so currently you’ll have to shell out more than MSRP or buy a graphics card with less memory. (For example, Nvidia’s 6GB GTX 1060 instead of a 8GB Radeon RX 580.) It doesn’t have built-in Wi-Fi support. It’s not nearly as compact or small. And though I purposely left a controller off the build list (for PC gaming, a keyboard and mouse suffice just fine), you’ll need to factor in another $15 to $60 if it’s a must-have.

Truthfully, now that we’ve updated the parts list with current pricing (as of October 2017), the most surprising part of this build is the price increase for components like the Blu-Ray drive. In June, this FX-8300 system was $652. The $60 hike makes our more modern Ryzen 3 alternative (see below) look just as good, if not slightly better, as an alternative.

Build #2: The upgraded 4K/30-fps gaming PC

Our second build swaps out the standard Blu-Ray drive for a 4K UHD Blu-Ray drive—and changes the CPU and motherboard configuration as well.

Build Notes

Prices current as of October 26, 2017. Retailers chosen with shipping costs in mind—and the assumption most people have an Amazon Prime account. The price for this ASRock motherboard is after $5 mail-in rebate. See the Build Summary section for notes on cost. This price is after a $3 coupon discount plus a $15 mail-in rebate.

Build breakdown

For the most part, this build shares the same approach as our first one. The key difference is the substitution of Pioneer’s 4K UHD Blu-ray drive. The swap puts the optical drive’s specs in line with the Xbox One X, and it also makes this build quite a bit more expensive by comparison.

Pioneer

For the moment, you can’t get around this painful jump in cost. The cheapest compatible processor is a $183 Kaby Lake Core i5-7400, and because only a few motherboards support the Draconian DRM specifications for 4K UHD Blu-ray disc playback, the lowest-cost option is $154. Moreover, Pioneer currently has the only option for a 4K UHD Blu-Ray drive. The short of it is that you have few options for components (and price shopping) if you go this route.

Build summary

This upgraded rig nails the Xbox One X’s main features: It should run games in 4K at a minimum of 30 fps on a Medium graphics setting, support HDR, and play 4K UHD optical discs.

However, like the first build in this article, it has its downsides. First of all, if you build this PC at this very moment, you’ll pay an inflated cost for that RX 580 plus the RAM. This system is also much more expensive than the Xbox One X. At $940, you could buy the Xbox One X almost twice over.

Build #3: A modern, Ryzen-based 4K/30-fps gaming PC

When we first published this article in June, I noted that AMD’s upcoming Ryzen 3 processors might offer better performance than the FX-8300 for the same price. This build tackles that question head-on.

Build notes

Prices current as of October 26, 2017. Retailers chosen with shipping costs in mind—and the assumption most people have an Amazon Prime account. Cheap motherboards like the ASRock A320M-HDV lack on-board Wi-Fi, so if you want wireless connectivity, prepare to shell out for either a Wi-Fi adapter or a better motherboard. See the Build Summary section for notes on cost. This price is after a $3 coupon discount plus a $15 mail-in rebate.

Build breakdown

On paper, the AMD FX-8300 in Build #1 makes an Xbox One X PC clone seem very tidy: It’s an eight-core CPU, which sounds the same as as the eight-core processor in Microsoft’s current-gen consoles.

However, PC enthusiasts know that a huge gulf exists between a true eight-core desktop CPU and the custom part used for the Xbox One lineup. What matters more is the FX-8300’s price, which was $90 at the time of our initial June pricing. That puts it squarely in budget CPU territory.

Now that the FX-8300’s price is rising—as prices do when components begin to obsolesce—a Ryzen 3 1200 ($110) is an easy alternative. Yes, the 1200 is a four-core, four-thread part, but it’s a desktop-class component comparable to Intel’s mid-tier ($180+) Core i5 CPUs. Because we’re building a gaming PC, there’s no point in forcing an artificial replication of specs in order to appear evenly matched.

AMD / Amazon

Going with a newer processor also opens up the possibility of upgrades down the line. Though an AM4 A320 motherboard offers few substantial upgrades over an AM3+ 970 board, it does support booting from an M.2 NVMe solid-state drive. You’re not stuck with a slow hard drive or even a SATA SSD as your only options for storage.

In addition to the CPU and the motherboard swap, the type of RAM is different in this build. We’ve picked the fastest RAM of the low-cost options. Fortunately, that turned out to be 2,400MHz–since Ryzen’s performance is influenced by RAM speed, it’s a nice stroke of luck.

Outside of these changes, this system shares the same approach as Build #1: It supports only standard Blu-Ray playback to keep as close to $500 as possible, and the rest of the components were largely chosen for cost. That includes even the Radeon RX 580 graphics card with its inflated street price.

Build summary

Like Build #1, this rig walks the line between the Xbox One X’s main features and the cost of PC components: You’re able to play games 4K at a minimum of 30 fps on a Medium graphics setting, view HDR content, and watch DVDs and Blu-ray discs.

It’s still more expensive than Microsoft’s console, however. If all you care about is gaming and media playback, buying an Xbox One X will provide that and still leave you $193 to spend on games.

If you want the flexibility of a PC, though, this Ryzen build lays a foundation for a system that can be upgraded over time. Faster storage and a better graphics card will be easy swaps. Availability and pricing for future graphics cards will hopefully be much better than they’ve been since the crypto-currency mining frenzy began.

The game will run at 30 FPS. ,https://fraghero.com/ubisoft-shares-bad-news-xbox-one-xps4-pro-version-assassins-creed-origins/,"Both Microsoft and Sony has powerful mid-life upgrades to their established home consoles now. The PS4 has the updated PS4 Pro while the Xbox One has got the Xbox One X, which was unveiled as recently as E3 2017.

However, fans thinking they are going to get a similar experience on these beefed up consoles to a PC are in for a disappointment. Ubisoft has confirmed that the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X versions of Assassin’s Creed: Origins will be running at 30FPS.

Many fans were hoping the new updated consoles will be capable of running the game at 60FPS but that’s not going to happen. Giving some compensation is the fact that the game will indeed support 4K on both Xbox One X and PS4 Pro.

This was confirmed by Windows Central. They have also mentioned some other notable facts about the console version of the game.

I spoke to a developer from Ubisoft working on that game and inquired about the version parity between PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. He told me that Assassin’s Creed Origins will be 4K at 30 FPS on both the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro, which I found a little confusing. If the PS4 Pro can handle 4K 30, how is Assassin’s Creed Origins utilizing the Xbox One X’s additional overhead? It isn’t, apparently.

Bluehole, the developers of smash-hit PUBG, announced via twitter earlier today that they are adding zombies to their game. However, unlike H1Z1, DayZ, or Call of Duty, the zombies will be entirely player controlled. Bluehole has done an excellent job of listening to the community, and this story is the perfect example of that.

Some streamers decided to play “zombies” with their fans. The group was split up into 4 survivors and a TON of “zombies” (regular characters without ranged weaponry). Bluehole’s development team LOVED the idea and decided to make the vision of the community a reality. It’s uncertain when Bluehole will release the new mode to the public, but they have reassured everyone that the development and refinement of the main game is still their number one priority.

In addition, the zombies mode will definitely be separate from the main game- zombies will not be incorporated into the main body of Player Unknown’s battlegrounds.

Check it out:

As you can tell by the trailer above, the premise of the newest Wolfenstein is the same as its predecessors- kill Nazis, save the world. However, past games were set in WWII- Wolfenstein: The New Colossus is set in Nazi-occupied America in an alternate timeline where the Axis powers win WWII.

As cool as this concept is, there are some people who are very upset about the ideas behind the new Wolfenstein. A group known as the alt-right has called the game “racist towards white people” because the game is all about freeing America from the Nazi regime- and Nazis just so happen to be white. 4Chan and reddit have been alight with the fury of the alt-right since the release of the trailer.

There’s a single part of the trailer that the alt-right is most upset about is a short clip where a black woman (who happens to be a leader in the anti-Nazi, pro-America resistance movement) calls the protagonist a “white boy”.

All I have to say on the matter is that it’s just a game- and on top of that, it’s not like gamers haven’t been killing Nazis in games for almost as long as videogames have existed.",People Think ‘Wolfenstein: The New Colossus’ Is Racist For This Reason
They're working on 2 major games. ,https://fraghero.com/elder-scrolls-6-not-development-bethesda-explains/,"A lot of fans were looking forward to Bethesda announcing The Elder Scrolls VI during its E3 press conference this year.

After all, Bethesda’s been announcing a major game in its E3 conferences for a while now. However, fans were left disappointed when it only announced a Nintendo Switch version of Skyrim during its own press con and a Skyrim VR edition during Sony’s.

There’s still more bad news coming up as Pete Hines, the Vice President of Bethesda, has confirmed the game isn’t even in active development right now.

Virtual Reality. ,https://fraghero.com/xbox-one-x-doesnt-support-major-feature-ps4-pro/,"This might not go down well with some fans. A new report suggests that the Xbox One X touted as being the ‘most powerful console’ ever made, doesn’t support virtual reality.

During an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Xbox’s marketing boss Mike Nichols revealed the reasons behind the lack of VR support for the console:

The opportunity on PC is larger, because the install base is larger and we think the customer experience will be better on PC

This still comes as a surprise since Xbox One X’s biggest rival the PS4 Pro comes with VR support and has a dedicated VR peripheral in the form of the PlayStation VR headset.

Sony showed off a decent line-up of upcoming VR games for the PS4 Pro while the Xbox One X didn’t have any, and now that it’s confirmed not to be supporting VR, the PS4 Pro definitely seems to have an edge for the consumers who’re looking for a console that enables VR experiences.

In another setback, it was also confirmed that Destiny 2, Bungie’s upcoming online shooter, will be running at 30FPS on the Xbox One X, much to the dismay of fans who were expecting it to support 60FPS for the game.",Xbox One X does not support this major PS4 Pro feature

",https://fraghero.com/call-duty-ww2-will-replace-create-class-feature-instead/,"Some more news has surfaced regarding what we can expect from the upcoming Call of Duty: WW2. This time, it isn’t about which forces you’ll be able to play as, or what to expect from the zombie mode, or which historic battles you’ll be playing through…

The Create-A-Class feature for multiplayer, as you know it, is gone. It’s not going to be a part of this game. Instead, it’s going to be replaced with something called divisions, and here’s how they’re going to work, according to Sledgehammer Games in a recent interview with the PlayStation Blog:

“Divisions fundamentally redefines how players invest in their Multiplayer soldier career. Replacing the create-a-class system, players choose from five iconic World War II divisions each with specific basic combat training, division training and weapon skills. We think it’ll intrigue Call of Duty series veterans, and we can’t wait for our fans to see it for themselves.”

It’s not clear exactly how that will work, but presumably you’ll choose between divisions such as snipers, infinity, and so on .. and you’ll be able to spend your accumulated points on upgrading each division, which will likely have their own unique weapons, rather than upgrading individual weapons to be used across classes. It sounds like it could be similar to the pre-made classes we’ve seen in past games, except now with the option to upgrade them specifically.

From the sounds of it, people are really looking forward to a throwback Call of Duty game that keeps the best parts of the recent entries but trims away some of the overkill, as many believe some of the more recent entries have really jumped the shark.

In addition to new features that will be implemented in the upcoming shooter, the developer revealed that a key feature in its predecessor would not be returning.

According to Bungie, the Grimoire cards will not be coming back in the sequel. For those that are unaware what these Grimoire cards are, they were a type of award players received after completing certain in-game actions (e.g. discovering a new location or killing a particular enemy), these cards could then contribute to your overall Grimoire score.

During an interview with Forbes, Steve Cotton was asked whether the sequel would incorporate the cards that relayed the game’s plot. “The answer to that question is ‘no,’ Cotton said. “[T]he reason it’s ‘no’ is because we want to put the lore in the game.”

According to Cotton, the reason for abandoning the Grimoire cards was to allow players the opportunity to discover Destiny’s lore on their terms, by investing time into the single-player campaign as well as exploring the in-game universe.

“We want people tp be able to find the lore. All the story is told through the Adventures, it’s told through the characters in the world, it’s told through the campaign and it’s told through the scannable you find throughout the world.”

Hopefully, this will help clear up massive plot holes from the first game. I am excited to see how Bungie will introduce exploration into the game’s narrative.

Battlefield 1’s first female multiplayer soldier has some fans thinking that it’s about time, whereas others have criticized the move saying that DICE is ignoring realism in order to serve some kind of politically correct overlord – but these people are ignorant to the fact that women did, indeed, serve in combat roles in World War 1, so this addition to multiplayer serves to increase the realism of the game, not reduce it.

Not only that, but this is something that takes some of the most horrific and tragic moments in human history and makes them into a fun game, so let’s not pretend realism is the only objective, otherwise we’d be gearing up to deploy, not turning on a gaming console.

Expected to be roughly $700. ,https://fraghero.com/project-scorpio-to-be-the-most-expensive-console-ever-expected-to-cost-this-huge-amount/,"The Project Scorpio console is going to be insanely powerful, there’s no doubt about it. Microsoft’s newest venture will have capabilities far beyond that of the Xbox One and even its next-gen competitors. However, the technology required to make the console what it is comes with a hefty price tag.

Let’s break down the price of the Scorpio piece by piece based on what Microsoft has planned for it. For starters, the console will have a top of the line AMD processor- probably from the new Ryzen line if AMD’s Scorpio namedrop at CES 2017 is anything to go off of. One of these costs anywhere between $350-$450 ALONE, a price point considerably higher than a 500GB Xbox One.

In addition to the processor, the Project Scorpio console is also equipped with an incredibly powerful graphics card; according to Microsoft, it will have 6 teraflops of processing power and will be able to support games with 4k graphics AND stream in 4k AND record in 4k simultaneously.

It will have incredible VR capabilities as well. The graphics card needed for this heavy of a workload would cost around $400 as well. However, keep in mind, Microsoft will almost definitely get a huge discount for buying for mass production for all of its parts.

The two parts (literally just the processor and graphics card) we have a solid estimate on still cost upwards of $700 themselves- that doesn’t even include the storage, OS, casing, etc.

Experts estimate a gaming computer with specs identical to the Scorpio would cost approximately $2,000. Fear not, though, there’s no way the Scorpio will be that expensive. It’ll probably sit in the $700-$800 range, which still makes it the most expensive console in over 20 years.",Project Scorpio to be the most expensive console ever – expected to cost this huge amount
They'll be stuck with 30 FPS. ,https://fraghero.com/bungie-shares-terrible-news-console-version-destiny-2/,"Destiny 2 had a lot of new information revealed yesterday and people were mostly impressed by what was on offer.

However, console users were in for a shock as Bungie revealed some key information about the game.

The developer confirmed that the console version will be locked at 30FPS and this applies even for PS4 Pro and Xbox Scorpio.

Offering some consolation is the fact that the game will support 4K on consoles.

Bungie actually spoke at length about why it chose to lock consoles at 30FPS during an interview with IGN:

IGN: “Why did you make that decision. You’re like ‘We’re going to lock it at 4K/30 max on consoles.’ Is it just like, you don’t want to push the consoles too hard, or why do you make that choice?” Luke Smith: “I mean, I’m going to wade into this, and you [Mark Noseworthy] can flesh it out. The console, the PS4 Pro is super powerful, but it couldn’t run our game at 60. Our game’s this rich physics simulation where collision of players, networking, etc, and like, it wouldn’t run.” IGN: “Yeah, makes sense.” Luke Smith: “Not enough horsepower there.” Mark Noseworthy: “But there’s tons of GPU power in the PS4 Pro. That’s why we’re doing 4K, right? It’s on the CPU side. Destiny’s simulation, like we have more AI, more monsters in an environment with physically simulated vehicles and characters and projectiles, and it’s part of the Destiny magic, like that, like 30 seocnds of fun, like coming around a corner and throwing a grenade, popping a guy in the head, and then you add like 5, 6, 7 other players in a public event; that is incredibly intensive for hardware.”

Maybe space, where humankind has had to move after the earth was destroyed, but either way – here’s a new take on the setting.

Impact Winter is an upcoming survival game by Bandai Namco and Mojo Bones set to release on May 22nd.

You play as a man named Jacob who has to survive in a winter wasteland caused by an asteroid that hit the earth, sending dust and debris into the atmosphere and triggering a horrific shift in the earth’s climate. The oceans are frozen, just about everyone and everything is dead, and a small group has to try to survive with the hope that help will soon arrive.

You’ll have to venture outside of your shelter to discover resources to help with crafting things to help you survive, to boost the power of your rescue beacon, and to help you when you have to venture out again into the horrific frozen wasteland. You’ll have to navigate carefully, and plan your voyages strategically, because if you get caught in a whiteout without enough resources or unable to find your way back, that’s trouble.

Your rescue beacon can be boosted in order to slightly reduce the amount of time until help arrives, which starts at 30 days. The exploration can lead you to all sorts of different places, but how far will you dare to go?

To top it off, there’s a very fitting soundtrack that really ties everything together. You might think a snowy world would get a bit boring, but there’s enough going on in the different settlements and areas that you explore, that it shouldn’t feel dull or repetitive.

There was a small bag of Meth inside. ,https://fraghero.com/11-year-old-gets-used-gta-v-copy-finds-something-horrific-inside/,"An 11 year old kid got a used copy of GTA V, opened it up, and got a lot more than he bargained for. GTA just got real.

Inside the game’s case was a little baggie filled with meth. Let’s be real, who hasn’t used a game case as a hiding spot at one point or another? Although most of us weren’t hiding freaking CRYSTAL METH and then trading the game in so that a child would end up with them. Someone out there is a very upset mother, and an even more upset junkie.

Here’s a rundown from the mother’s Facebook post:

Today i took my son to gamestop in Tallahassee to trade in games and get some new ones. When he opened the booklet inside one of the pre owned games he ( MY ELEVEN YEAR OLD SON!!!!!!!) found this. A baggie of fucking meth! Clearly the game was not properly checked when it was traded in and because of the carelessness i could have lost a child. Thankfully He brought it right to us and said what is this?

Was this an accident, or is Gamestop branching out to test some new business models to make up for all of the digital downloading that people do nowadays?

Here’s a report filed by officers who were called to the scene, as obtained by Kotaku:

A regrettable google search revealed that the street value of the drugs is close to $500.

Those “M” ratings on games are no joke, but this isn’t even the first time this has happened. Gamestop needs to get their act together and stop accidentally selling drugs to children. They probabally only paid about $1.50 for the trade-in, too. Gamestop also issued a response to Kotaku, as follows:

“We are disappointed to hear about the experience one of our customers recently had when purchasing a pre-owned video game from one of our local Tallahassee, Florida stores. We work diligently to ensure the quality of our pre-owned items are like new. Unfortunately, in this circumstance our thorough process fell short. We are extremely concerned that this incident occurred, and are working with the local police department to support them in their investigation.”

That’s right, it talks about how diligently they work with a thorough process when it comes to vetting their used games. Apparently a baggie sitting right there in the instruction booklet doesn’t raise any red flags, though.

"""I'll never feel strange about promoting great games. You should play it on the platform you own.."" ",https://fraghero.com/xbox-boss-gave-perfect-reply-asked-console-wars/,"Image credit: www.wired.com

Phil Spencer took to Twitter to express his thoughts on the console wars. According to the Xbox head, the console rivalry is senseless.

Recently, Spencer tweeted out to Tarsier Games to congratulate the development team for their most recent title, Little Nightmares. Following his compliment, Spencer received a bit of hate from one user, who claimed that it was coincidental that the head of Xbox was promoting a multiplatform game, that appeared to have better reviews on the Xbox One than any other system it was released.

After the accusation had been made, Spencer replied to the user, explaining that people should play games on whichever platform they currently own. “I’ll never feel strange promoting great games,” Spencer replied. “You should play it on the platform you own..”

After his response, Spencer later added that gaming is all about the games, not the system that you’re playing it on. “When specific game discussions turn from playing great games to which piece of plastic I own I feel like we’ve lost the plot a bit,” he tweeted.

This is not the first time; the Xbox head has expressed his disapproval of the console wars. Last year, he stated that he finds it “utterly distasteful” when some ‘gamers’ have an elitist attitude when a game on a rival platform receives a lower-than-anticipated score on a review.

“And I don’t. I’ve been vocal about that as well. I’ll turn it around now. Like, when ReCore came out and there were some of the lower scores that were given, I would have PlayStation fans tweet me, happy that ReCore wasn’t getting great review scores from some outlets. I just thought it was such a negative thing for our industry for somebody to be gleeful that somebody gave a game a review that was lower than what the team expected. And I don’t just think about that in terms of the games that we build. I can look at Hello Games and No Man’s Sky. I’ve known Sean Murray for years, and I said I want them to be successful with the games that [the industry] builds. The games industry gets bigger and better as more people enjoy playing games. And I also think about the teams behind these games, and these are people who spend years of their lives, so committed to the art form of building games. And then when it comes out, for somebody to kind of fold that into a “My console is better than your console” in a very petty way, I find it completely distasteful.”

Regardless of whether you’re a fan of Nintendo, PC, PlayStation or Xbox, at the end of the day the important thing is that we are purchasing a system we like based on preference. But more importantly, that the games we get on our platform of choice are fun.",Xbox boss gave the perfect reply when asked about Console Wars

"They won't glorify the Nazis. Although they acknowledge that you need the Axis powers for multiplayer, so they can't/won't shy away from it. ",https://fraghero.com/call-duty-wwii-devs-promise-multiplayer-gameplay-wont/,"There are high hopes for the upcoming Call of Duty game. Even if you look at the reception of the trailer alone, you can assume they’re on the right track compared to other recent ones that were completely slammed. Now, the devs have made an important announcement about something that the multiplayer WON’T do, and it has to do with Nazis.

It’s a World War 2 game, with a multiuplayer mode, which means you could end up playing as a Nazi. That can get a little uncomfortable. Sledgehammer isn’t going to shy away from history, but they’re also taking steps to avoid glorying things.

“The big distinction that Germans still make today is that between the German military and the Nazis. We made sure we made that distinction in the game, that the Germans were doing their duty …” said Glen Schofield, co-founder at Sledgehammer.

“We have a great historic conflict of good versus evil,” continued Michael Condrey, another co-founder of the studio. “But to make factions work you have to play as the Axis. In no way are we going to glorify that position, but we also can’t shy away from it.”

We’ve gotten bits and pieces through various announcements and leaks, but certain things are up in the air. Activation hasn’t denied claims that the game could feature historically troubling locations like Auschwitz, and regardless of whether it does or not, it seems apparent that this game is going to hit a lot closer to home than a Call of Duty where you’re jumping off walls with jet packs.

“This global conflict was rooted in some true atrocities,” said Condrey in a statement to Polygon. “The story is anchored in some iconic moments in the war. The D-Day invasion in Normandy was one of those. There are also other things that make the war so powerful. The historical context of the atrocities of World War II is something that we want to tell the players.”

They asked him to give specifics on the types of historical atrocities that will be included, and here was the response:

“We’re storytellers. Part of that narrative is having fans really be able to experience that for themselves. We don’t want to get into mass graves or things like that. I don’t want to get into the full narrative arc, but suffice it to say there is a flux in human history because of the power of those atrocities committed and we want to tell the whole story.”

What do you think, would you rather have a game that glosses over some of the more troubling aspects of World War 2, or if they’re making a game about WW2, do you think they should aim for authenticity in their storytelling? Some will argue that a video game isn’t the best medium for that, others will argue that it’s exactly the right medium.

He has just achieved the remarkable feat of earning his 1,200th Platinum trophy on the PlayStation Network, but isn’t really happy about it.

The reason is that “there is no recognition” from Sony for making this remarkable achievement.

A Platinum trophy is only awarded if a player manages to earn all the other trophies in a videogame. This means you’ve to spend hours upon hours to earn it. Just imagine how much effort this guy had to put in to earn a staggering 1200 of those.

However, soon it came to notice that sending out metallic knuckles was actually illegal in many states in the U.S, including California, where EA is based.

Here’s what the California law states:

Manufactures or causes to be manufactured, imports into the state, keeps for sale, or offers or exposes for sale, or who gives , lends, or possesses any cane gun or wallet gun, any undetectable firearm, any firearm which is not immediately recognizable as a firearm, any camouflaging firearm container, any ammunition which contains or consists of any flechette dart, any bullet containing or carrying an explosive agent, any ballistic knife, any multiburst trigger activator, any nunchaku, any short-barreled shotgun, any short-barreled rifle, any metal knuckles, any belt buckle knife, any leaded cane, any zip gun, any shuriken, any unconventional pistol, any lipstick case knife, any cane sword, any shobi-zue, any air gauge knife, any writing pen knife, any metal military practice handgrenade or metal replica handgrenade, or any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a blackjack, slungshot, billy, sandclub, sap, or sandbag.

Two quotes on the leaked advertisement reveal that co-op mode in CODWW2 “unleashes a new and original story”, which suggests there could be a totally separate co-op campaign, although not necessarily – just because there’s an original story, that doesn’t mean it’s not a more arcade-like style of co-op that we’ve often seen in past CoD titles.

Lichdom: Battlemage. ,https://fraghero.com/this-is-the-worst-ps4xbox-one-game-this-generation-has-seen/,"Gamers often have the task of trying to decide what platform to play a game on: PC or console. Sometimes it really does not make a huge difference in regards to features, quality, or even the community. However, when it comes to Lichdom: Battlemage, the answer is clear to keep it PC.

This game was released on Xbox One and Playstation 4 on April 19 2016, nearly two years after its initial release on PC.

There have been many successful games making the move from PC to console and vice versa, but this one was nothing short of a disaster.

After viewing DigitalFoundry’s YouTube video demonstrating this FUBAR of a console debut, I decided to watch some streamers on Twitch to see it for myself; sadly, they were not wrong. It’s rough.

Continued

The frame rate of this game barely gets to 15fps, and that’s intermittent. There are ridiculous loading times. The Xbox One version displays significantly darker than the PS4 and PC versions. I couldn’t watch more than 10 minutes of an Xbox One streamer before pouring myself a glass of wine to calm my nerves from irritability.

It was almost unbearable to watch. The PS4 streamer had a little cleaner quality but you could still tell that the frame rate was lethargic. I enjoyed watching the PC streamer because there were no issues with textures loading in slowly, frame rate dips, or excessive lag.

This is CryEngine 3’s first game running in full 1080p resolution for the Xbox One. Although this is progression for them, it does raise a flag in regards to playable quality. With nearly two years in between PC and console releases, there should have been more testing and tweaking before releasing it on Xbox One and PS4.

Maximum Games might be the real culprits, though, since they conducted the port. The company did release an announcement about wanting the improve the game to make it more enjoyable for its players, touching on poor frame rates and achievements not unlocking properly.

It’s disappointing because this game looks really fun to play. As a huge FPS fan that has a love for mage-type characters, I would be inclined to spend the $49.99 on it if I didn’t already know that the poor quality would make me want to break my controller in half.",This is the worst PS4/Xbox One videogame to have ever released
"Season pass, they have an idea on what to do but aren't announcing it yet. ",https://fraghero.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-wont-one-hated-features-predecessor/,"Star Wars Battlefront 2 was officially revealed last week and it seems to have ticked all the right boxes so far. Not only did it deliver on its promise of including a single-player campaign as well as aerial combat for multi-player, but it’s also gone a long way in showing fans it’s listening to their feedback.

One of the biggest steps it’s taking in that direction is doing away with the season pass. That’s right, the game won’t be having a season pass unlike its predecessor.

The season pass got a lot of heat when it was announced as a $50 add-on for the first game, especially as fans felt the game was rushed for a release and a lot of content was locked in just to make the extra buck later on.

However, it looks like Battlefront 2 won’t see a similar situation arise, the creative director of the game, Bernd Diemer confirmed this to Mashable himself:

When we looked at the way Battlefront had evolved over its lifetime, with the DLC and everything, we decided, ‘You know what? For this type of game, season passes are not the best thing. We need to [take it apart] and come up with something better

Diemer said it wasn’t an easy decision and they have another model in mind for it to all work out without compromising on the quality and experience offered to the players:

I cannot talk about the specifics of this, but we have something different in mind that will allow you to play longer, be [more] invested in the game without having a fragmented community

However, when Mashable contacted, EA chose to take a more cryptic stand about the same:

Consoles will have upgradeable parts and games will have more staying power. ,https://fraghero.com/head-xbox-says-consoles-future-will-like-pcs-reason/,"You could make the argument that consoles have already been moving closer and closer to gaming PCs, first with online connectivity, then hard drives that become easier to upgrade. And if you want to be technical about it, obviously consoles already are computers, but practically speaking the gap between consoles and PCs is going to continue shrinking, according to Phil Spencer.

In the future, Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, imagines consoles that span multiple generations due to upgradable parts and games having more staying power.

In an interview with Gamasutra, he talks about gaming hardware becoming multi-generational, because there are games that have really long shelf lives and are played for many years after their release.

“Console games feel more like PC and almost mobile games, than they ever have. Not visually, in the case of mobile games, but in terms of games as a service.” – Phil Spencer

Thanks to consoles having “.5” versions coming out mid-life cycle, it’s not hard to imagine hardware generations getting more and more blurry.

Phil also brings up a good point about mobile and PC games, and how they don’t just suddenly stop working when you upgrade your hardware. If you buy a new PC, all of your existing games will still work – and that hasn’t really been the case with consoles, save for the occasional backwards compatibility.

Being able to upgrade specific parts in a console, as opposed to the entire thing, and being able to easily keep playing our older titles without having to dust off previous generation’s consoles are two changes we could be seeing in the future that are very gamer-friendly. Even if they’d be charging a premium on the upgrade parts, this still helps to eliminate some of the cons when you’re comparing PC gaming to home consoles.",Head of Xbox says Consoles in future will be more like PC’s for this reason
"The power supply is perfect for them, small place that's accessible and warm when the console is on.  #ew",https://fraghero.com/console-repairmen-explain-cockroaches-love-infest-ps4s/,"Cockroaches like to live in small, confined places. They’ll eat just about anything they can come across, and once they start to lay eggs it’s game over. Cockroaches love to infest PS4’s, to a point where you’ll even find guides online about how to cockroach-proof your console. Why is it that they like PlayStation so much?

The PS4’s power supply is the perfect little home for cockroaches, it’s easy for them to crawl inside of it and when your system is on it’s got free heating for the roaches. They’ll start to breed and defecate in the system, and eventually it screws up the circuit boards and fries your console.

It won’t light up, it won’t do anything, it’ll just be dead. If you send it to Sony, even under warranty, they open it up and check for roaches right away. If there’s signs of a roach infestation, you’re out of luck. Some repair shops are willing to fix this for their customers, and some aren’t.

Here’s what a PS4 repair shop had to say about this surprisingly common issue:

"Only if they can make it look great. Also they mention they'll only do it if the fans really want it, and if it reflects well on the company, and if it helps further what GTA/Rockstar stands for e.t.c. All the usual corporate stuff 😂. ",https://fraghero.com/rockstar-is-open-to-remastering-gta-games-but-only-if-this-condition-is-met,"Take-Two Interactive spoke in detail about a lot of things during a recent investor call and it shared some details regarding Rockstar Games’ policy about doing remastered versions of old Grand Theft Auto titles such as San Andreas and GTA III. (Take-Two Interactive owns Rockstar Games.)

The company made it clear that it’s not adverse to the idea but it isn’t overly eager to do it either. It’ll only pursue such opportunities if it’s confident that it can make the remaster look ‘great‘,

Take-Two Interactive’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, explained in detail about its approach to GTA remasters when asked if games such as Vice City and GTA III might ever make it to current gen consoles.

He assured people that this was something “[Rockstar Games] will decide in due course,” but warned that it “wouldn’t do anything that’s not going to look great creatively.”



The starting point is, ‘Is this going to delight customers, is this going to look good?’. “You know that we’re a company that is not driven first and foremost by ‘Can we create revenue this way?’ We would start by saying, ‘Will this be exciting to consumers, will they be happy with it, will it reflect well on our brand, will it reflect well on our company?’ And if the answer is yes, then it may well be a compelling opportunity. But if the answer is indifferent or no then even if we have an opportunity to make a few bucks we probably would decline. I think that’s the lens through which we look, the actual decisions are made by the labels [Rockstar and 2K].

It’s clear from his statement that Rockstar Games would do justice to any Grand Theft Auto remasters, if they decide to do them. It might eventually happen if fans really want it but don’t expect Take-Two to dive into it for some quick and easy money as they value the GTA brand too dearly to pull off such gimmicks.

Take-Two also delighted fans by revealing that Rockstar Games is currently working on Red Dead Redemption 2, so there’s plenty to look forward to.",Rockstar is open to remastering GTA games but only if this condition is met
"Shipping unfinished games. Day one patches for glitches or bugs can be acceptable but it's more the games that change their ending or finish developing a mission in the middle of the game. E.g. The end of Mass Effect 3, or the Stealth Mission in FFXV (chapter 13?).

Your regularly scheduled programming will continue shortly.",https://fraghero.com/terrible-gaming-trend-needs-stop-2017/,"There’s an issue in gaming, and it’s been magnified recently. Previously, getting patches and updates to games once they were already released just wasn’t feasbable on consoles. Things could be fixed in a re-released or a GoTY edition, but it wasn’t as common of a practice for most games.

Now that consoles have hard drives and internet connections, it’s easy for developers to fix issues, improve performance, and offer updates to players. This is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it means that glitches and bugs can be fixed, but on the other hand it means games don’t have to be as polished before release, and it provides a bit of a crutch to the publishers who put unrealistic deadlines on their teams and rush games out the door before they’re ready.

Sometimes, the post-release edits are major things, like changing the ending of a game due to backlash from fans. This starts to create a really blurry line. If games are art, it is okay to change that due to demands from the consumers? Lucas from CheatCC points out that gamers are becoming too entitled, and bullying developers into making changes due to unrealistic expectations.

“If we want games to be elevated, to be taken as seriously as film and literature, we need to let the creators be creators and let them fail or succeed on their own terms.” Lucas White, contributing writer at CheatCC.

In a lot of cases, that argument makes sense. The tough part can be making the distinction between which problems in a game are due to artists taking a chance and misfiring, and which problems are due to publishers putting unrealistic deadlines and expectations on studios to rush things out before they’re ready. It’s also a slippery slope to try to please everyone, and there’s a certain point where gamers have to sit back and realize that it’s very rare for a game to be in the realm of perfection, and if we get too spoiled due to social media outrage being able to re-write the history of games that are already released, we risk developers being unable to take chances with their creations and facing a watered-down industry that focuses even more on sequels to proven best-sellers and less on innovation.

Pre-ordering games that ship filled with bugs with the intention of patching things up down the road isn’t something that’s going to change until it stops being a viable business model. Glitches, bugs, and glaring issues should be fixed, but when you start re-writing the endings of games or making overhauls to parts of the story that aren’t as well received, it starts to raise some interesting questions.",This Terrible Gaming Trend Needs To Stop in 2017

It’s a known fact that both these companies are fierce competitors, always looking to get ahead of each other.

Now, thanks to a study commissioned by Google, we know which one holds an edge when it comes to being popular among teenagers.

The study revealed that teens find the Xbox brand ‘cooler’ than PlayStation. However, Sony shouldn’t worry too much, as the core gaming age group between 18-25 years, prefer the PS4 to the Xbox One.

However, teens aged between 13-17 feel Xbox is the fourth coolest brand in the world, while PlayStation ranks a distant seventh. Youtube, Netflix and Google took the first, second and third spots respectively.

The study was carried out by YouGov and Gutcheck, who held three different surveys to come to a conclusion. It involved 1600 teenagers and 800 millennials based in the US. These people were asked the questions between May and July of last year.

One point to be noted is that while Xbox is owned by Microsoft, which is an American company, PlayStation originates from Japan.

3. Motion Blur - mostly used in driving games it blurs the edge of the screen to make it look like you're going faster or to symbolise how fast you're going. Some people like the feature but it depends what game you're player, if it's an FPS you could probably forgo the Blur.
4. Shadow Settings - for the sake of performance, sacrificing the crispness of the shadows is not game breaking and can save a lot of resources.
5. Depth of Field - rendering the immediate environment is obvious but depending on how far you want your character to see, stopping your computer from rendering the long distance backgrounds can save a lot of processing power.

Even if your PC can handle it, why not push for a better frame rate in lieu of unneeded graphics settings? Or why not put a little less stress on your hardware, so that it’ll run a bit cooler and last a bit longer?

Here are some settings that you can safely disable. Of course, try it for yourself, do the side-by-side comparison and see what you think. If you can’t tell a different, you’re all set. If you can, then you crank that setting back up and pretend this never happened.

Dynamic Reflections

This one can make a huge difference. For instance, on Overwatch, you can boost your FPS by 30%, even upwards of 50%. Dynamic reflections means seeing shadows in water and other random reflective surfaces.

It depends on the game you’re playing, but chances are you’ll barely notice them, if at all.

To make sure the game could be released on time with The Force Awakens. ,https://fraghero.com/ea-finally-reveals-why-star-wars-battlefront-didnt-have-a-single-player-campaign/,"Image: starwars.ea.com

Executive Vice President of EA Studios, Patrick Soderlund discussed why Star Wars Battlefront didn’t have single player campaign while speaking during EA’s Investor Day event. Soderlund also hinted that the single player campaign might be introduced in the sequel of the game.

The EA Studios boss mentioned that the decision to leave out the campaign mode from Star Wars Battlefront was purposeful. He said that the decision had to be made in order to release the game early to meet the Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

It is notable that Battlefront had content from Jakku which was also relevant in The Force Awakens. The game, however was based on the original Star Wars Trilogy.

Although the game was a commercial success, Soderlund said that he wasn’t happy with the average review score of the game. The game scores 72 in the PC and PlayStation 4 versions and 75 on Xbox One version on Metacritic.

He said, “The one thing that we got criticized for was the lack of a single-player campaign. It was conscious decision we made due to time and being able to launch the game side-by-side with the movie that came out to get the strongest possible impact.” “I think the team created a really good game based on the premise that we had. I would say the game has done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional EA game. So from that perspective, it’s a success. Are we happy with the 75 rating? No. Is that something we’re going to cure going forward? Absolutely,” he added.

Despite not having a single-player campaign mode, Battlefront does have solo and offline ‘Missions’. He also detailed how EA is looking into the ‘depth and breadth’ before starting a new project.

“The depth and breadth is something that’s proving to be more and more important,” he said. “In a world where we want $60 up front and we expect people to stay with us over the course of a long time, the depth of what we offer is important.” Soderlund added, “We have to go back and course correct that for another version if we were ever to build one.”

On the other hand, EA CFO Blake Jorgenssen said last week that they were working on a sequel to Battlefront which will include content from the recent movies and have better and bigger worlds.

Keeping in mind, Soderlund’s comments, it is safe to assume that the sequel will also feature a single-player campaign, which is bound to strike the right chords with fans.

Ever since Activision announced that the game will take the series into space, there has been a huge backlash from the Call of Duty community.

The game’s announcement trailer holds the notorious record of being the second most disliked video on Youtube ever. However, initially, the publisher brushed off the negativity surrounding the game, claiming that it has performed really well.

That statement changed during a recently held financial earnings conference call by the company. Activision’s CEO Eric Hirshberg, who had previously defended the game, finally admitted that the game actually under performed a lot and didn’t live upto the company’s expectations.

Hirshberg also agreed that the game’s sci-fi setting didn’t resonate with the entire CoD fanbase:

Infinite Warfare had a ton of great gameplay innovations. But it also had a setting that didn’t appeal to all of our fans.

He also confirmed that the upcoming Call of Duty game developed by Sledgehammer Games, due out in November this year, would take the series back to its roots and offer a boots on the ground experience.

In other news, Battlefield 1 went on to become the most successful Battlefield game ever made, and it was set during world war 1.

What makes things more interesting is the fact that a recent leak suggest that the next Call of Duty, developed by Sledgehammer Games, is going to be called Call of Duty: WWII which basically means World War II.

This can work both ways for the company: fans might be really pleased to have gotten something they’ve been demanding for a long time or they might feel Call of Duty is just trying to ape the success of Battlefield 1, which was set in World War 1.

PLAYERUNKNOWN's Battleground.

The general consensus is quite positive. It’s called Battlegrounds and it’s giving AAA shooters with massive budgets a run for their money. The full title is PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS, referring to Brendan Greene, who created the Battle Royale mod for the Arma 2 mod DayZ. After moving over to Arma 3 upon its release, they were hitting 50,000 active monthly players in Battle Grounds.

Brendan was contacted by someone at Daybreak Game Company (Formerly Sony Online Entertainment, the people who put out games like Everquest, Planetside, H1Z1) to license the last man standing idea to create a new mode for H1Z1.

Fast forward to last week, when Battlegrounds dropped and has been getting a great reception so far. After working on Battle Royale for years as a passion project, it’s all evolved into something completely next-level. From “Hmm, I wonder if I could make a DayZ mod?” to having one of the hottest new titles.

With PLAYERUNKNOWN as the creative director, Battlegrounds is still in its early access stage, so things are only going to keep getting better. It’s priced under $40 for now, and you can grab it on Steam if you want to see what all the fuss is about.

One user created a thread on Sony’s Playstation support forum when the problem first arose after they installed the latest update, and the thread became filled with other people having the same issues. It took weeks for Sony to respond, and when they did, it was just a brief note to Polygon saying: “We are aware and are looking into the situation.”

For many people, it’s not a big deal, because their Wi-Fi is still working fine, and for some of the people with broken Wi-Fi, they can just run an Ethernet cable, but everyone else is SOL and stuck waiting for Sony to address this more thoroughly and they haven’t even been given a time frame yet.

“Go to [Settings] > [Network] > [Set up Internet Connection] to configure the network settings again.”

As another solution to that error code, Sony also suggests disconnecting other devices from your Wi-Fi connection because it could be busy, and the final solution if all else fails is “Try Later.” But they haven’t given any tips to fix the broken Wi-Fi problem in particular, as the normal solutions to error NW-31297-2 don’t seem to be working.

He replied saying the theory is incorrect. ,https://fraghero.com/bethesdas-vp-shares-bad-news-elder-scrolls-vi/,"Representative image only

Bethesda’s Vice President, Pete Hines, is known to be quite active on Twitter and he rung in the new year by making fun of a prediction made by Michael Pachter that involved The Elder Scrolls VI.

The analyst had made the shocking prediction that Bethesda was planning to announce a new Elder Scrolls game during E3 this year and would be releasing the game in 2017 itself, near the end of the year.

Bethesda has earlier carried out a similar strategy for Fallout 4, which is announced during its press conference at E3 2015 and went on to release it near the end of the same year.

However, Pete Hines has put all rumours and predictions to rest for those thinking that it’s planning to use a similar tactic for Elder Scrolls VI.

Hines made the following tweet rebutting Patcher’s prediction completely.

This clearly means Bethesda doesn’t seem to have any plans of releasing The Elder Scrolls VI this year and it’s still quite a while away.

"Without paying, it will take 2.5 years to unlock everything (excluding DLC and game modes). 
(Calculation in the comments)",https://fraghero.com/unlock-everything-honor-pay-732-play-game-crazy-amount-time/,"It’s nice when there’s a game that gives you a lot to unlock, if you really get into it you’ll be occupied for a long time and really get your money’s worth.

But sometimes, things get a little squirrely, like when you can just drop a huge wod of cash instead. Granted, people can decide what to do with their own money, and if that means spending over $700 to unlock everything in For Honor instead of actually playing the game, that’s their prerogative. However, if you opt to play the game instead of pulling out your wallet, you’re not looking at a month or two of grinding, you’re looking at over two years.

So, if you’ve got For Honor and you’re already looking for ways to play it less, here’s the choice: $732 or spend 2.5 years. That’s under a dollar a day to not have to play the game in order to unlock everything. Of course, you can still enjoy the game without having to unlock everything, so you save that $732 and also don’t have to spend 2.5 years at it. The controversial issue is basically that the game’s unlocks aren’t really available during the game’s “lifetime”, even if you go hard at it, it’ll still take you about a year.

A user on reddit named bystander007 ran the numbers, here’s a breakdown:

“The average hero requires around 91500 steel to unlock all base games (no DLC/Update content) unlocks. This includes Emotes, Executions, Effects, Outfits, and Ornaments. From there, you multiply by 12 (for each hero) and get 1,098,000. That is approximately 7.32 of the $100 steel packs.”

Here’s why it’ll take so long to do:

“Assuming 1-2 daily hours of playtime for 5-7 days per week, it would take players 915 days or two and a half years – but by then, Ubisoft could have released a sequel already. “More dedicated For Honor players can do it more quickly, but there’s a limit to grinding Steel since the system was designed to reward first and foremost about two hours every day. They could earn up to 23550 Steel in a week, but even so to unlock everything they’d have to play 326 days – almost a full year.”

Some people argue that you’re not entitled to have everything unlockable in a reasonable fashion without having to pay, and others will argue that yes, you are, you paid for it.

The issue of DLC and unlockables can get complicated, at the end of the day we’re in favor of supporting developers as much as possible when they’re being fair to us, the players. Is it unfair for Ubisoft to expect people to pay hundreds of dollars, or to spend years, in order to get the full experience, or should people not worry so much about being completionists?

Recently, evidence has been surfacing on the internet, implying that the next installment in the Red Dead series may, in fact, be a prequel.

Late last year, we first reported that Red Dead Redemption 2 information was leaked, shortly afterward, Rockstar Games confirmed that the game was currently in development, with the first trailer revealed a few days after their announcement.

Several gamers are speculating that Red Dead Redemption 2 might be a sequel because of the way the first game ended. In the ending of the original Red Dead Redemption the main protagonist, John Marston dies. If the speculation that the next entry is indeed before the events of the first game, we can infer that the next game will focus on Marston and his crew before they disband.

Earlier this month, a dedicated Red Dead fan, revealed that several voice actors from the first game are all following each other on Twitter. Including Marston’s voice actor, Rob Wiethoff, and Steve J. Palmer, who voice Bill Williamson in the original game. A couple of days later, voice actor Roger Clark, who’s voice sounds very similar to the individual who did the voice over in the RDR2 trailer “liked” a speculation video on the upcoming game on YouTube.

Another telling clue was that one cyber sleuth found a private resume of an actor who did motion capture for “Dutch” in Red Dead Redemption 2, a character that dies in the first one.

Currently, Rockstar has not commented on speculation but hopefully, more news regarding the game’s story will be announced in the coming months. Red Dead Redemption 2 is anticipated to launch later this year on PlayStion 4 and Xbox One.",Gamers are Finding Clues Red Dead Redemption 2 is Set in The Past

",https://fraghero.com/the-6-most-shocking-videogame-scenes-of-all-time/,"Videogames allow us to be a part of an interactive experience unlike any other medium. Not only are you immersed in the moment but often you’re in control of the outcome. Needless to say, this puts us through a roller coaster of emotions more often than not.

Although most of it is fun and games (pun intended), there are some rare scenes which actually make us feel real emotions in connection with the storyline.

Today, we look at some of the most shocking videogame moments of all time that not only proved difficult to play but also left a lasting impression on the player. Note: This feature contains major story spoilers.

No Russian – Modern Warfare 2

The fact that we’ve written an entire article about this level from Modern Warfare 2 is reason enough for you to believe that it’s by far the most controversial videogame level of all time and definitely one of the most shocking sequences ever created.

Terrorism is an actual problem that the world has to battle every single day with acts of terror becoming more and more frequent and well executed. In this day and age, having a level that puts you as part of a group of terrorist invading an airport and spraying unsuspecting civilains with bullets is definitely not a decision many developers would dare make.

Especially, if you’re responsible for creating the next installment of one of the best shooter franchises of all time. But, Infinity Ward did just that and in doing so created a memorable yet courageous sequence that remains videogame’s poster child for controversy to date.

Meet Samus Aran – The Main Character of Metroid

Metroid, an action-adventure game by Nintendo was released back in 1986. The game was the first edition of the legendary Metroid series. Video games in the 80’s usually featured male characters who would be given the task of rescuing their females. Metroid was the one of the first games which featured a female character as its protagonist.

However, Nintendo never announced or let the players know that they were playing with a female character. The players got to know about that once Samus revealed herself by removing her helmet after the completion of the game during the end-credits scene. This was a shock for many of the kids back in the 80’s who were accustomed to controlling cars or playing with male characters.

Wifi connectivity issues. ,https://fraghero.com/the-latest-ps4-firmware-update-is-causing-this-serious-problem/,"Last week, Sony released a major update for the PlayStation 4. This new firmware update offers a variety of highly-demanded features, including support for an external hard drive, modifications to PlayStation VR, and custom wallpapers just to name a few. However, many PS4 owners have reported several issues with update 4.50.

According to several PS4 users, on the official PlayStation Forums, update 4.50 is causing some annoying WiFi issues. Gamers who’s wireless internet connection worked fine prior to the update are now reporting connectivity issues with their console, resulting in major lag and issues joining online matches.

To combat these issues. here are a few do it yourself solutions:

Switch your wireless router’s signal support from B/G/N to just B/G. This workaround requires accessing your wireless router’s internal settings by typing the IP address of your wireless router directly into your web browser and entering the username and password.

Some users are reporting success after disabling their router’s wireless password or switching security from WPA2 to something different. Fair warning, though the WiFi issues are not worth compromising your wireless security.

If none of the above work, then connect your PlayStation 4 physically through a network cable.

Currently, Sony has not commented on the update 4.50 WiFi controversy. But hopefully, they are working hard on making a patch to address the issue.",The Latest PS4 Firmware Update Is Causing This Serious Problem

In the last week there were many reports that the game had been facing several issues regarding the budget and the release date was expected to be around 2020.

On the other hand, there have also been rumors regarding the location the the game would be based in. The rumors have started to increase lately and one city is getting the most coverage right now. It also makes sense since Rockstar did explore it in one of its previous versions. There was also an Easter Egg regarding this in GTA 5.

We’re talking about none other than the city of London. It might be the perfect GTA VI location with its diverse culture and great humor. However, one thing that might stand between London and GTA 6 is UK’s real life gun laws.

It is almost unlikely that Rockstar Games would go back to London because they had already made a London based game called GTA London 1969.

So, at this point we can consider the release year of the game to be 2020 and nothing has been finalized on the location yet while these rumors do add to one’s curiosity.",Rumor: GTA VI’s apparent location revealed and it’s not where you’d expect

",https://fraghero.com/8-things-gamers-lie-about-while-playing-videogames/,"Prepare a list of gamers who have never lied, and it might just be a short list. Almost every gamer has told a fib including even me, the great Vikram the merciful, and I’ve been mashing thumb since the age of seven.

Be it beating a boss, finding a secret tunnel, or blaming your poor connection for a loss, lies have been prevalent in gaming since the early 1800’s.

Let us look at some of such lies which are widely used by gamers.

1. Boasts About Having A Higher K/D Ratio

K/D Ratio means the Kills and Deaths Ratio. K/D ratio is a number which is derived after dividing the total number of kills with the total number of deaths. For example if you get 10 kills in a game and die 5 times your K/D ratio is 2.

K/D ratio is actually a status symbol among the gamers, hence they lie about it all the time. There are lot a gamers who never reveal their K/D ratio to others and lies about having a better ratio than they actually have.

2. Blames Lag

This is one of the most common lies that a gamer uses when they lose a multiplayer game. There are a lot of gamers who feel that they can never be beaten unless there is lag. It’s kind of instinctive now for most of us to blame lag despite having a good connection. Maybe you should blame your newb skills, blaming lag salvages some pride despite losing or getting killed.

3. Accusing Others Of Cheating Or Hacking

This lie is prevalent in multiplayer gaming scenarios. Everyone knows that there can always be gamers who have better skills than the others but only a few of them will agree. Anyone who plays better gets called a cheater or hacker or gets accuused of using an exploit to win the match.

If you are a good player, you should have definitely been called a hacker more than a few times.

",https://fraghero.com/8-pointless-things-gamers-do-that-have-no-real-use-whatsoever/,"Don’t we love videogames? They can get quite immersive at times. So immersive in fact that the lines between virtual and real are blurred to the extent that we fail to see the difference between them. This in turn compiles us to carry out real life actions while playing them with the rather absurd idea that it somehow impacts the outcome within the game.

Does it make any bloody sense? Nope. But does almost every gamer end up doing it anyways? Hell yes. This is the beauty of games, you tend to get so invested that you don’t bother making a fool of yourself by doing such things.

Today, we look at 8 such common things that we have all done at some point while playing our favorite games and then looked back only to realize how stupid we are for doing them. Then we go and repeat them all over again. It’s an endless cycle. No really.

Pressing X while at the loading screen

This is perhaps the most common thing we tend to do. Games, especially current-gen ones, often come with huge open worlds or complex algorithms that requires loading screens between sequences. This can be termed as being a necessary evil and they tend to create a disconnect from an otherwise immersive experience.

No one likes to encounter a loading screen which…well…refuses to load quickly. The best way to ensure it does? Repeatedly pressing the X button of course. Many independent researchers have concluded that it actually tends to work as hundreds of gamers have claimed in the studies, that by pressing X continuously at the loading screen, it loaded faster.

Of course, the studies have no proof that not pressing it would have made it load any slower, but try telling this to the gamers.

Shouting at players while playing Football Games

This is just a dumber version of shouting at real life football players while watching a match. We’ve all had that intense FIFA session with our pals when our virtual avatars make a terrible mistake resulting in the opposition getting an upper hand.

The quickest way to fix such a situation is of course shouting on top of our lungs the choicest of abuses aimed towards the guilty player inside our TV screens. The virtual guy who is the result of someone’s code is definitely going to improve his play due to it. And hey, we’re definitely not the ones controlling his in-game actions. Tsk. Tsk.

Did anyone mention logic? Such a pity. We all know it always works and no matter what anyone thinks or says, we’ll continue to do it.

Trying to lean in real life to look through corners

Realism and videogames go hand in hand. With shooters such as Battlefield 4, Crysis 3 and Black Ops 3 blurring the lines between virtual and real, it is only natural for us to carry out some real life movements while playing them.

The most common of these is when we’re trying to look through corners, rather than pressing the button that enables us to lean (if the game allows it), we often end up trying to lean in real life, hoping against hope that it’ll give us a better view in the game that we’re playing.

It’s a pity it doesn’t work and we quickly vow never to repeat such a stupid action again, only to end up doing it again in the next round that had gone a bit too intense for our liking.

Pressing the button harder while playing fighting or racing games

Another extremely commonplace occurrence. I daresay almost all of our readers have done it at some point. If you’re old enough to have been part of the hipster group of gamers playing the original racing hits such as Need for Speed: Most Wanted or even Ridge Racer, you must have pressed the buttons harder in hopes of getting that extra bit of speed added to the mix.

It never worked nor will it ever do in future but we’re still guilty of doing it even to date while playing the most cutting-edge of racing games (Gran Turismo 5, I’m looking at you). It’s fun to do and actually makes us feel like we’re doing better. Which in fact makes it useful I guess? Only it doesn’t.

Tilting your controller while controlling your vehicles

We’ve done this one while playing the choicest of racers to games like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row. Every game which features vehicles that can be driven has compelled us to carry out such a real life reflex action at some point of time.

We’re not to be blamed for doing so either (no matter how stupid we look due to it) since some situations demand such drastic measures. That tough corner or sticky situation isn’t going to fix itself unless we tilt the controller adequately.

The beauty of is that a PS4 game called Driveclub actually paid homage to all the souls that tried doing it millions of times without noticing any kind of difference in-game by actually implementing it in the game.

Closing your eyes while playing Horror Games

This one only applies if you’re one of the brave enough gamers to actually play horror games. You’re a hero for playing them in the first place but being brave enough to play them does not necessarily mean you’re man enough to actually see everything that it throws at you.

We’ve all come across that one horrifying sequence that is just too much to swallow. The best way to detach from what follows is to put up your hands on your face trying to avoid seeing whatever horrors the game has in store for you.

It usually ends up with your character being brutally murdered but hey it at least saved you from the trauma of going through the process yourself. Too bad you once again resume playing the game and the horrors can’t be avoided for long.

Trying to hold your breath in real life while doing underwater sequences

You’ve all done it. Playing Mario 64, in one of the many underwater levels. You jump in and instinctively hold your breathe in real life. Why? No one knows! There’s really no reason at all for it, but there you are, holding your breathe while Mario traverses through the water.

The same applies to while playing countless other games as well. Nothing would make us stop believing that it actually raises our chances of surviving these levels by doing so.

Hitting various buttons while trying to catch a Pokemon

Quick! Hold B on your Gameboy! 1 shake.. 2 shakes.. 3 shakes.. GAH IT BROKE FREE! You and I both know that as a child, you were told by your brother, friend, or somehow conjured up the idea yourself that holding down buttons while trying to catch a Pokémon would help.

Blizzard ravaged 1970's Canadian wilderness. Kona is heralded as the next big survival game. Trailer in the comments ,https://fraghero.com/new-survival-adventure-game-might-best-ever/,"This new game puts you smack dab in the middle of blizzard-ravaged 1970’s Canada, a setting basically untouched in the gaming world. You play as private detective Carl Faubert. Your goal? Investigate strange events going on around Atamipek Lake and figure out what sort of supernatural shenanigans are afoot, all while fighting the elements to survive against the odds.

Kona looks like it might be one of the best games of the year and maybe even one of the best survival adventure games of all time– there really isn’t anything like it out there. The storyline is compelling and quite eerie, but it doesn’t go so far as to define itself as a horror game.

The novel setting of Kona also lends itself to new narratives and types of adventure that can be had- not to mention that Kona’s rendering of the woods of Northern Canada is gorgeous. The soundtrack is also unique, featuring Canadian folk music from band Curé Label.

The developers, Ravenscourt and Parable, are planning on releasing Kona later this year to Xbox One, PS4, and PC. It may not (currently) be one of the most pre-ordered games of 2017, but it will no doubt be a contender for Game of the Year.

Symmetra. Lovely reply to fan letter in the comments ,https://fraghero.com/blizzard-confims-overwatch-character-autistic/,"Blizzard has done a lot to be very inclusive in Overwatch and they have put together a very diverse cast of characters. Sometimes, people complain about it or say that it feels kind of shoehorned in, but they’ve also earned a lot of praise for these decisions and made a lot of people feel more represented in gaming, or in this game at least.

The aspects of social awareness don’t have an impact on the gameplay itself and there’s no story mode, so it should be the type of thing you either don’t really care about, or that you think is great. It’s hard to understand why people are getting truly upset over this Overwatch lore. From plus-size characters, to LGBT characters, and now an autistic character, Blizzard isn’t afraid to tackle themes that you generally don’t find in AAA video games.

Imagine you’re an autistic kid, you have a tough day at school, maybe people give you a hard time and you don’t always fit in with your peers, you just want to come home and take your mind off things with your favorite games, and then you find out that there’s a character that is like you. Awesome!

All the legendaries will be in the game by the end of 2017... apparently. ,https://fraghero.com/niantic-finally-reveals-when-legendary-pokemon-are-coming-to-pokemon-go/,"The time has finally come, Pokémon Go fans. Legendary Pokémon are almost here.

Niantic, the makers of the cultural phenomenon Pokémon Go, have just announced that Mew, Mewtwo, Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres will all make their way into the game by the end of 2017. Their release may seem far away, but Niantic plans to make these legendaries worth the wait.

Niantic made a similar decision with their release of Ditto- they decided to keep Ditto out of the game for a while so when they finally put it out, they could make it special. I assume something similar will happen with the legendaries.

They will either release in special events around the world or each legendary will have their own unique mechanic, perhaps one similar to the tasks you have to complete to catch all the Regi’s in Pokémon Sapphire/Ruby/Emerald.

I think it would be great if Niantic made catching legendaries difficult. Having a challenge would make catching incredibly rewarding and would separate these incredibly rare Pokémon from the rest.

It's a fan theory that the small town of Rorikstead is sacrificing young fertile woman to the daedra for fertile lands and profitability. It makes sense as there are clues that lead to it but it's not confirmed by Bethesda. ,https://fraghero.com/skyrim-player-discovers-longest-kept-secret-hidden-plain-sight/,"There’s a dark, hidden story hiding behind a seemingly innocent little town in Skyrim…

It all goes back to Lokir, the other guy who was captured at the start of the game…

We find out that Lokir dislikes both the Stormcloaks and the Imperials, which is a big clue that kind of flies under the radar if you aren’t paying attention. Why did he decide to flee from Rorikstead, a seemingly innocent town? Something’s just not right about that place…

Here are some facts about the town of Rorikstead:

There’s a wizard in this town trying to secretly teach magic to a little girl. Upon inspecting the wizard’s house, we discover he worships Daedra.

There’s a song about Ragnar the Red which dates back a very long time, and references the town.

“Rorik” means “Red King” or “Bloody Warrior”.

In The Elder Scrolls Online, it’s revealed that this small farming town dates all the way back to the first era, yet other villages in Skyrim claim it’s a new town that has just recently sprung up.

Another book, a shipping manifesto, reveals that the town was present in the 2nd era. The conclusion from all of this? Maybe the town has fallen and risen again over time.

Rorikstead has surprisingly fertile soils and bountiful harvests considering it’s size and location.

Most homes have soul gems inside of them.

Many women die during childbirth, despite the fact that the town is home to a healing wizard.

Rorik says he fought in the great war, and had his life saved by a healer.

So, keeping all of that in mind, and a few other points that are brought up in the video, what’s the theory?

The town is actually a secret cult of Daedric worshipers, and it’s unclear how many townsfolk are in it on.

There’s a dialog with the wizard Jouane Manette where he vehemently denies there being any kind of secret to this town, which obviously raises red flags.

The fertile mothers who are dying are actually being sacrificed for fertile land. One woman is still alive because she’s too old to be fertile, along with two twin sisters who are alive because they’re too young.

This could explain how the town rises and falls. If they stop doing sacrifices, it would anger the Daedrics. If they keep sacrificing, they aren’t able to grow their population or give birth to future generations of citizens.

Is the town mage teaching magic to the little girl so that she can someday take over the duties of sacrificing fertile woman?

ESO on Youtube, who came up with this theory, says it ties together all the strange loose ends and items in the town.

The developers Hello Games and it’s founder Sean Murray largely avoided discussing in public what exactly went wrong with the game, and were radio silent for months after it release. This led to a lot of fan outrage which eventually mellowed down.

Fast forward a few months, and Sean was finally willing to disclose a few new details during GDC 2017 about what exactly went wrong. Murray disclosed that his team made a very poor prediction about the concurrent players who’ll play the game on launch day.

It predicted the maximum number to be 14,000 while the actual number went on to become 500000 concurrent users. 250,000 of those were playing on various diff PC configurations.

Murray further revealed that the company’s networking team, which comprised of only one staff member, was overwhelmed by the response and struggled to keep things together. This inexperience led to several issues during the early days of the game.

Murray stated – “It was far beyond what I’d experienced before, in terms of people playing a game.”

Murray also disclosed that the studio he ran (Hello Games) comprised of only nine employees over the last five years and revealed that the actual world-building data of No Man’s Sky was only 300MB at launch. The rest of the 2GB (which was the game’s size at launch) consisted of pre-baked UI assets and audio files.

He also said that the studio was running out of money while making the game which proved to be a challenge while “trying to finish something you care about really creatively.”

Although he’s still not given any clear answers for the debacle that was No Man’s Sky, from a gamer’s perspective (it was a huge commercial success), he’s definitely provided some insight about went wrong.

In addition to that, you’ll have to buy a new license for the game, since your old one will be burned when you’re busted.

Results are inconclusive. The switch gets better resolution but occasionally lower frame rates. The video in the article states more testing is necessary though.

It's an issue that manifests in both versions of the game, for different reasons. While DF notes a marginal Switch advantage -- in tablet mode, the frame rate issues disappear -- the video also admits that more testing is needed.

The studio confirmed that Destiny 2 will be a total rest and no Destiny 1 characters would carry over. This means you won’t be able to carry over any of your weapons or in-game items (which you potentially spent hours collecting). However, you’ll be able to retain your character’s appearance.

Sequels represent the start of a new adventure for every player, with new worlds to explore, new stories to tell, new powers to acquire, new loot to earn, and much more,” This led us to a decision that would enable us to serve both the game and the player’s best interests: Destiny 1 power, possessions, and Eververse-related items and currency will not carry forward. They will, however, remain accessible to you in Destiny 1.

This goes against the studio’s initial promise of Destiny ‘being a ten year game” but some fans might appreciate this move since Destiny 1 has been severely criticized for being broken. However, others might still feel cheated as a result.

Bungie made it clear that your character’s appearance and few other traits would be carried forward if you’ve achieved Level 20.

We know that, just like us, you have grown fond of the Guardians you’ve created, so we do plan to preserve your character personalization. We are going to recognize the dedication and passion you’ve shown for this world. Specifically, the class, race, gender, face, hair, and marking selections for all characters that have achieved Level 20 and completed the Black Garden story mission will carry forward. We also plan to award those veteran accounts with honors that reflect your Destiny 1 accomplishments.

"$5000, 12 consoles and 15 games. Fuck thieves man :-/ ",https://www.gamnesia.com/news/thieves-stole-a-playstation-4-from-a-childrens-cancer-ward-but-the-kids-got,"

Many children, including those spending time waiting in the hospital, use video games as a way to pass the time. Tragically, a thief in New Zealand recently took it upon themselves to steal a PlayStation 4 from the oncology ward of Wellington Hospital. The donated console was used by many of the patients as a distraction during their stays for various treatments. One patient, nine-year-old Angus Little, regularly played Minecraft on this console during his weekly chemotherapy visits for an inoperable brain tumor. When asked his feeling on the theft, Little commented,“I’m angry, and pretty annoyed because it was a good distraction for me, and other kids too.”

All is not lost, though! Due to considerable donations, the hospital manged to raise more than $5,000 thanks in part to Little’s Facebook page. Alongside this money, twelve consoles and fifteen games were donated to Wellington Hospital. Little’s school, the Rata St. School in Naenae, also helped to raise money in the form of a lunchtime event. The money raised, which originally was meant to help the hospital buy another PlayStation, has now been given to Little’s family.

There is no excuse for someone to do something this cruel to a group of children, but it’s great to see how others have reacted to it. What are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments below!

That’s because, the current record held by an Australian named Okan Kaya, holds the record for continuously playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 for five-and-a-half days at a stretch. FIVE freaking days, man.

This Australian guy absolutely destroyed the previous record, blew it to pieces. The old record stood at 120 hours and seven minutes. His new record stands at 135 hours and 50 minutes. Eat shit, old record guy.

His world record setting gameplay began on a Tuesday. He was only allowed to take a ten minute break every hour. He kept his spirits up by having energy drinks, and light meals frequently.

Here’s what he had to say:

My hands were cramping up and I went through a lot of bandages. I even tried to ‘pad up’ my controller.’

What might have worked to his favor was the fact that Guinness allowed the breaks to be stored. This meant he was able to cash in several of his breaks at once, enabling him to sleep for hours at a stretch.

"No real reason given from bioware... but the article theorises its ""to keep the feminists happy"" ",https://fraghero.com/mass-effects-female-characters-intentionally-ugly-reason/,"Bioware really screwed up this time. A large portion of the gaming community is up in arms about the character design and modeling for the female characters in Mass Effect: Andromeda.

The developers of Mass Effect: Andromeda are currently under fire for intentionally making the female characters less attractive than in past games. You might say, “well, maybe the new characters are just more accurate portrayals of the real-life models Bioware chose- it is possible, right?” Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Check out this tweet from @luzariuslive:

Steven Brewis’s character looks a lot like him, even down to the stubble. Then, you look at Sara Ryder- and nothing makes any sense. Bioware’s representation of Jayde Rossi looks absolutely nothing like her. It’s not even remotely close. Here’s another example from Twitter:

Not. Even. Close. Bioware became notorious for this after doing pretty much the exact same thing to the vast majority of the female characters in Dragon Age Inquisition, and it doesn’t look like they’ve changed their ways at all.

Personally, I think this entire thing is a little ridiculous. Female character models in games like Fallout 4 and the Witcher 3 have nothing wrong with them, and they (for the most part) aren’t overly sexualized. Their female characters are accurate representations of the models they are based off of- as are the males. It’s a shame Bioware thinks that they need to do this to keep feminists happy. Intentionally toning down the beauty of models like Jayde Rossi just so people won’t riot is ridiculous. There’s nothing wrong with an accurate character model.

And you certainly don’t see anyone getting mad about any of the ridiculously jacked male character models in games, now do you?",Mass Effect’s Female Characters Are Intentionally Ugly For This Reason

Prey is going to let you turn into a roll of toilet paper.

And yeah, I know, my pun was terrible. I don’t regret it.

Upcoming Bethesda title Prey puts you in the shoes of Morgan Yu, a man trapped on a space station who is tasked with saving humanity from an alien race. One of the alien varieties you will fight is the Mimic, a weird, spider-like creature that has the ability to take on the form of any inanimate object it sees. As the story progresses, Yu gains the power of the Mimic- he can turn into pretty much any object in the game, including toilet paper.

The ability looks like it’s going to be very versatile. Demos show players using the Mimic ability to reach areas they wouldn’t otherwise be able to. Yu can move around when he’s mimicking another object, which lets him roll through small gaps as a coffee mug or, yes, a roll of toilet paper. The mimic game mechanic is novel and looks like it’s going to help make Prey one of the best games of the year.",Prey Will Let Players Turn Into This Disgusting Item
Paid for DLC and a Season pass. ,https://fraghero.com/nintendo-just-confirmed-this-hated-feature-for-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/,"It is a sad, sad day for Zelda fans.

Nintendo has crossed over to the dark side; there will be not only paid DLC for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but also a season pass. A season pass. FOR A NINTENDO GAME. Unbelievable.

However, as lame as it is that there is going to be paid DLC for Breath of the Wild, there is an upside to Nintendo taking the season pass approach. Because it’s been confirmed, theres a chance that Nintendo will continue to put out new content after the first two already announced DLC packs are released.

It does mean that we’ll have to pay more money, but we’ll also get even more top quality Nintendo content.

Get this though- the first DLC pack? It adds a hard mode and a Cave of Trials to the game. I have 2 huge problems with this. First: YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY AT A HIGHER DIFFICULTY. WHY? Second: the Cave of Trials was in Wind Waker, but it was included with the game- there was no good reason (outside of greed) for Nintendo to make either of those features DLC.

The good news is that the second pack actually looks quite good; it will add a completely new storyline to the game in addition to another massive dungeon.

Oh, and Link will be able to wear a Nintendo Switch t-shirt in game. That too.",Nintendo just confirmed this hated feature for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
Medical syringe. Kinda like the defibrillator in previous BF games.... so not really THAT unexpected after all. Video in the comments ,https://fraghero.com/unexpected-way-can-kill-enemies-battlefield-1/,"When it comes to unexpected methods of slaughter in Battlefield 1, there are things like crashing a zeppelin into someone or lobbing a grenade while parachuting out of a flaming biplane. However, there’s one way to kill that won’t only surprise your opponent, but also make them unbelievably salty.

The method is outlined in this video:

The secret lies in the Medic class. The medic’s syringe doesn’t just have the power to revive fallen teammates from the verge of passing into the void, it also delivers an instant, mostly humane (I think) death to any enemy player it comes into contact with. Doesn’t really matter where you stab them either: regardless of whether or not you stab them in the foot or the eye, the Battlefield 1 Medic’s injection is always lethal.

Even though most other classes are more feared than the humble medic, there is something so satisfying about a syringe kill. Also, I don’t think any type of death is more frustrating than being killed by a dude with a syringe when you have a gun.

"To reach sales targets. They will say a brand new game is out of stock (when it isn't) to sell Pre-Owned copies of the game. One person is quoted that they saw a shop opening new copies so that they could sell them as pre-owned. The company GameStop are apparently prioritising selling and buying pre-owned games and consoles, getting customers to sign up to rewards programs and ""highly lucrative pre-orders"" as that is where they make the most profit and putting pressure on staff to do just that with specific targets. ",https://fraghero.com/gamestop-employees-are-reportedly-lying-to-customers-for-this-reason/,"GameStop is one of the last bastions of brick and mortar retail hope in a an increasingly digital landscape. The American retail chain operates 7,117 stores throughout the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.

This strip mall staple is often the subject of internet hate, because many consumers believe the publicly traded company implements unfair pricing practices. The retailer is frequently roasted with hilarious memes.



They operate a buy and trade program that allows customers to purchase games, then sell them back when they’re finished. Many customers believe the buy back prices are unfairly low and the pre-owned prices artificially high.

Recently, many gaming consumers have been outraged to learn that GameStop implements a company wide quota policy called “The Circle of Life.” as reported by Kotaku. The goal of this corporate directive is to get people to sign up for rewards programs; sell more pre-owned games and consoles; and primarily to increase highly lucrative pre-orders.

This profit driven directive has created a perverse incentive system for GameStop employees. Each employee wants to hit their quotas, which might incentivize them to mislead customers because they can risk termination by not hitting quotas.

GameStop employees really don’t want customers to come in and only buy a brand new game, because that’s not counted to their quota. They are being guided to push buyers towards buying used, pre-ordering, signing up for a rewards card, or trading in some of their old games.

As reported, Employees might mislead customers by claiming they don’t have copies of a new game or system in stock to try and persuade the customer into purchasing pre-owned or pre-ordering.

Sometimes the prices of pre-owned games can even be higher than new games due to demand. In that case, there have even been reported incidences of GameStop employees flat out lying to customers.

They felt the 'Chems' resembled real life drug abuse too closely. The game is released over there now so the issue was resolved but Med-X straight up used to be called morphine. ,https://fraghero.com/fallout-series-banned-australia-reason/,"The Fallout series we all know and love was banned in Australia because the Australian government thought one very specific aspect of Fallout 3 was far too similar to real life and would be a bad influence.

Why? Chems. Chems are consumables that change the status of your character. Taking Mentats, for example, increase your character’s intelligence and Buffout increases strength. Back in 2008 Fallout 3 was refused classification in Australia by the Office of Film & Literature Classification. The Australian government decided that Chems too closely resembled actual drugs. If you’re not familiar with the drug gameplay, here controversial YouTuber Willy Mammoth experiments with chems in Fallout 4 and gives a pretty good rundown:



To be fair, they do look quite similar- Chems are modeled in game after syringes, pipes, and even pills. Med-X was even worse, the Chem was originally called morphine. Straight up. No creative renaming of the drug. The Australian government didn’t take kindly to this and refused to rate the game, effectively banning it from sale. Even after Bethesda changed the name of morphine to Med-X, the Australian government still wasn’t happy. They eventually figured things out, because all the Fallout games are now available for purchase in Australia.

Here was the Australian government’s explanation, taken from the fallout Wikia:

“The game contains the option to take a variety of “chems” using a device which is connected to the character’s arm. Upon selection of the device a menu selection screen is displayed. Upon this screen is a list of “chems” that the player can take, by means of selection. These “chems” have positive effects and some negative effects (lowering of Intelligence, or the character may become addicted to the “chem”). The positive effects include increase in Strength, stamina, resistance to damage, Agility and hit points. Corresponding with the list of various “chems” are small visual representation of the drugs, these include syringes, tablets, pill bottles, a crack-type pipe and blister packs. In the Board’s view these realistic visual representations of drugs and their delivery method bring the “science-fiction” drugs in line with “real-world” drugs.” One of the reasons for the ban was of the opiate painkiller, morphine being one of the chems that would have been available to use by players. As a result of the ban Bethesda decided to have morphine renamed to Med-X. Evidence of this last minute change is the fact Med-X’s editor ID is “Morphine” and Med-X addiction’s editor ID is “WithdrawalMorphine”.

Personally, I think the ban was quite extreme. Even though I understand the reason why Fallout was banned, I think the reaction was quite extreme. The games are already M-rated and anyone playing them should know better than to take a copious amount of drugs like the characters of Fallout can and do. In addition, it’s not like the Chems only give positive effects; taking too many Chems too often will give your character addiction and withdrawal status problems (unless of course you have a perk that lets you take as many as you want without any negative side effects, but that’s beside the point).",Fallout Series Banned in Australia for This Reason
He has found and hacked every terminal but hasn't found the secret yet. Todd Howard (director of Fallout 4) has stated there are secrets in the game people haven't found yet including something to do with the terminals. This post asks for community help to analyse images of the terminals to see if anyone can spot the Easter egg. ,https://fraghero.com/this-guy-found-every-terminal-in-fallout-4-while-trying-to-uncover-games-final-secret/,"One brave soul, the youtuber Lavonicus, took it upon himself to find every terminal in Fallout 4. Why would someone undertake such a mad task, you may ask?

Well recently the director for Fallout 4, Todd Howard, stated that there were some things left unfound by players in the game, and one of these things was to be found inside a terminal.

Known previously for exploring all of Fallout 4’s underwater segments, Lavonicus was no stranger to this type of challenge, and immediately set to work.

Over 25 hours later, and Lavonicus has completed his task. Not only that, but he’s also uploaded a mammoth 1,364 image gallery full of pictures he took while on his quest, which can be found through his steam account.

The information found in the terminals cover all sorts of things, from diary entries, to item logs, to random item information – even plans to murder people. I’ve included a few examples of what can be found in the album below.

He’s done a video and has begun his quest of uncovering the secret but there’s a long road ahead and he might not be able to do in alone.

Despite his efforts, Lavonicus still has no idea what the easter egg might be, and calls on other gamers to assist in his next great task: Rummaging through every photo he took until something is found.

It appears he has literally taken a picture of every page of information found within every terminal in the game, so the easter egg could very well now be hidden in plain sight.

Hopefully, if enough people get in contact to help, we can all discover the hidden secret of the terminals in Fallout 4 that much quicker. And who knows, maybe what we find might shed some light on how to obtain other secrets hidden within the game.

A video of Lavonicus discussing his findings can be seen here, including links to the pictures in the description.

"For playing too well. EA have a system that detects above average players and if they meeting a certain criteria that is deemed ""highly improbable without hacking"" they get hit with the ban. ",https://fraghero.com/ea-banning-skilled-battlefield-1-players-worst-possible-reason/,"EA thought they had a flawless system in place to catch Battlefield 1 players who are cheating and using hacks, but there’s only one problem…

They forgot to take into account the fact that some people are actually really good at the game.

The anti-cheating measures in Battlefield 1 have been getting tripped again and again by honest, non-cheating players, who just happen to be great at the game.

Ever since Battlefield 3, there’s been a system in place called “FairFight” which uses algorithms to compare your real-time stats to that of an “average” player, and if you deviate too far from what EA deems “average”, you’ll start to trip the alarm, and get yourself an automatic ban. There’s no human looking at this and saying “Damn, that was a nice shot, but looks legit to me…”

If you play too well, SEE YA!

FairFight also looks at gameplay events that are very unlikely. In EA’s words, “not possible (or that are exceedingly improbable) to achieve without the use of hacks.” But there’s still a flaw there, because statistically speaking, exceedingly improbable is going to happen PRETTY OFTEN when you’ve got millions of hours being logged.

One player, named SpartanHoplite, was banned for going 202-8 in a match using a bomber.

After you’ve got hit with the banhammer, there’s really not much that you can do. Some of these are time-based, so you may be put on time out for a week.

Player’s such as Willy Mammoth who was accused of cheating by many players in the Battlefield community after releasing his unbelievable sniping compilation is exactly the type of player who might get in trouble:

There is a computer algorithm that is stopping people from playing a game they purchased, without any human intervention, because they are too skilled at the game. Let that sink in.

Even players who have logged thousands of hours under the FairFight system, progressively improved from game to game, are not immune. It doesn’t seem to take that into account. Some of the people getting banned are frequent streamers, so there’s evidence that they’ve been playing legit, but evidence doesn’t really matter when FairFight decides to bring down the gavel on you.

This is a broken system, and it’s finally getting publicized. We’ll keep you updated as EA releases a statement and with any updates.

",https://fraghero.com/disturbing-videogame-level-ever-made/2/,"Any mature person can tell the difference between a videogame and reality, but sometimes the lines get blurred and things can feel a little too real for comfort. That has been the case with a particular scene from a game called Spec Ops: The Line, which came out in 2012 and was relatively well received.

We’re seen plenty of violent and gore-filled games in the past, but they never seen to stick with us because there’s always a kind of cartoonishness to them. Even the more realistic ones. But with Spec Ops: The Line, there’s just something haunting about this scene that will disturb you to your core.

Players have reported having to take days off from gaming after experiencing this level:

It begins with your squad coming across an enemy encampment, but being way too outnumbered to go in there on foot. After some debate, they decide to use white phosphorous on the camp.

As you approach, they hear people screaming, and yelling, and one guy asks them “Why?”.. You respond “You did this to yourself”, at which point he says “We were trying to help…” and a startling realization sweeps over you…

You had bad intel.

The camp was filled with innocent civilians. Families, kids, moms, dads…

Having to slowly walk through the carnage and face your mistake isn’t something we’re used to seeing. The consequences of war are put front and center, rather than a glorification. Your character becomes a war criminal right before your eyes.

The mural of mount chilliad describes the story of GTA 5. Explanation and image in the comments. ,https://fraghero.com/gta-vs-biggest-mystery-has-finally-been-solved-after-three-years/,"Image: gta5cheats.com

If you are an avid GTA 5 follower, you would definitely be aware of the mystery centred around Mt. Chilliad. It has been three years since GTA 5 released and there are still unsolved mysteries and easter eggs involving Mt. Chilliad.

However, it seem like the Mt. Chilliad mural has finally been solved by an extremely dedicated and crazy fan. He has thoroughly analyzed the mural and taken the entire plotline of the game into consideration while solving the mystery.

Prior to the Mt. Chilliad mystery, the players had dug deep to uncover some other mysteries such as the bigfoot and the beast mysteries.

Now, the Mt. Chilliad mural mystery has also been solved by the same guy who played a big part in uncovering the bigfoot and beast mysteries. He goes by handle “Sir_Galehaut” on Reddit and is now considered as the mystery hunter in GTA 5.

Continued

Sir Galehaut has done extensive research to come to the conclusion. He has analysed that the mural is a plot summary of the storyline of GTA 5. He has even written up another analysis where he discusses that the storyline of GTA 5 follows the structure of a film rather than that of a typical video game.

Sir Galehaut spent a lot of time finding the meaning of the symbols seen on the murals. When you look casually at the mural, you can see a mountain which can be Mt. Chilliad and an UFO at its peak.

The mural also works as an analogy for the entire storyline of the game, which even includes all the three endings. We can consider the foot of the mountain as the start of the story and the peak as its ending.

The large symbols on the bottom are the three protagonists Trevor, Michael and Franklin, with the first two on both the sides and Franklin in the middle. This is because Trevor and Michael are connected while Franklin isn’t as he made his entry later.

The tunnels which can be seen on the mural are actually the plot threads which leads to some significant events in the story of the game. Above Michael’s symbol on the left, there is a small box which represents his act of demolishing the house of Martin Madrazo.

It gets even more interesting as more details are revealed that directly connects to the game’s main plot line.

Continued

On the other hand, there is also box between Trevor and Franklin’s symbols, which represents the moment when Trevor finds out that Michael is alive.

While we go further up the mountain, a roughly crossed shaped tunnel intersection can be found in the middle. This leads to the two boxes above and the UFO at the top. The tunnel intersection is the representation of the choice of the player at the end of the game. In the option C, both Trevor and Michael survive and the tunnel leads to the UFO.

This means that the game can be 100% completed with the death of either.

Another player pretending to be a self aware lonely NPC. Video link in comments ,https://fraghero.com/youtuber-records-journey-creepy-abandoned-mmo/,"Recently, while exploring through an old, abandoned MMO, youtuber “vinesauce” came across something a little unexpected. And also, quite unnerving.

The MMO in question, Active Worlds, was created in 1995. It’s a long since forgotten game that no one plays anymore. However, upon playing, vinesauce discovered that in fact he was not alone. Another character, called Hitomi Fujiko, was also in the server.

Hitomi initially appeared like an NPC character to vinesauce, due to his constant repetition of dialogue. However, this might not be the case, as the conversation between vinesauce and Hitomi began to take some rather strange turns.

This included Hitomi describing the loneliness of the world around him populated only by himself, and even pleading with vinesauce to tell him if he existed or not.

Now, this isn’t the first example of creepy events regarding videogames. There are many examples, particularly the Pokemon game in which Pokemon actually die, and the infamous Majora’s Mask save file haunted by the ghost of a boy named Ben.

This particular incident also has a video but we’re still having our doubts.

The video can be watched below and you can come to your own conclusions.

Naturally, this means people are very skeptical as to whether the events vinesauce shows really happened, or if they were just scripted.

Vinesauce claims that none of this video was planned or scripted, and when gamers researched further after watching the video, they discovered a website under the character Hitomi’s name, which appears to contain some hidden messages.

What could this all possibly mean? Is Hitomi a real person with real emotional problems, trapped in a game where he questions his existence? Or, is he just another creepypasta-esque gaming myth?

The video showing these vinesauce’s experience in the game can be seen here.

It bounces into the air. ,https://fraghero.com/gta-v-player-fires-rocket-pool-result-bizarre/,"All games have their weird flaws, and this physics bug in GTA V is no exception. As seen in the GIF below, RPGs behave strangely after the player shoots them into water. The character shoots the water with the rocket, but instead of just detonating or staying underwater like a torpedo, the rocket kind of bounces off the surface then careens into the air, exploding after a few seconds.

Weird, right?

GTA V, like GTA IV, runs on the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE). RAGE is a vast improvement over the engine Rockstar used for GTA III – Vice City Stories games. However, as with all physics engines, it does have bugs (as seen above). Rockstar actually updated RAGE with improved water and underwater physics for GTA V, believe it or not. Even though the probability of weird stuff like this happening is lower with the current version of RAGE than it was before, unexplainable video game phenomena can still happen.

Bigfoot.

The massive open world game offered players an unprecedented level of freedom and new discoveries are being made to date.

One of the game’s oldest mysteries was the rumor that there was the notorious mythical creature Bigfoot present in the game. Bigfoot is an Ape-human hybrid creature that apparently roamed the plains of Los Santos.

Later on, it was discovered that it was indeed in the game in the form of a hallucination that Michael experiences however sightings without the use of intoxicant remained unreported.

That’s changed after a Youtuber called It’sTinyTroll claimed to have discovered the beast in one of the game’s locations during nightime.

What’s more he’s recorded the entire sequence of events for you to watch.

As you can see, the guy travels across the Rayton Canyon at night and finally encounters the creature. He even ends up killing him and going close to the beast to inspect.

He grows a golden goatee. According to the picture from a Japanese exclusive arcade game Super Dragon Ball Heroes. ,http://epicstream.com/news/If-Nappa-Becomes-Super-Saiyan-Heres-What-Happens-to-His-Hair,"Nappa, the bald-headed ex-sidekick of Vegeta and one of the first villains in the Dragon Ball franchise, never became a Super Saiyan in Akira Toriyama's popular anime series, but fans have been wondering what would actually happen to his appearance if that ever happens. The form is characterized by gravity-defying blonde hair and insane amount of power, but since Nappa is bald, how would such transformation even change his look?

When Bandai released the video game Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi for the Playstation 2 back in 2015, we saw a short dialogue where we saw Nappa asked his partner Vegeta, ""Hey, uh…Think if I went Super Saiyan, my goatee would grow?""

Twitter user MrTrikey discovered what Nappa would look like if he transformed Super Saiyan 3 in Super Dragon Ball Heroes, a newly-released arcade game exclusive to Japan and is the seventh Dragon Ball Z: Data Carddass title. Nappa's hair would transform into something extraordinary, but it's not what a lot of fans expected.

Visiting every single one of the 291 optional locations on the map. That's it. Took him 9 months... ,https://fraghero.com/fallout-4-player-spent-750-hours-to-explore-every-location-in-the-game-and-find-its-secrets/,"Players have an option to explore a lot of things in Fallout 4. The game itself shows various locations to the players to explore, whereas there are a lot of other places which players can explore on their own.

One player, who is known by his online name “The LAWD” has managed to see all the 291 optional locations in the game. It took nine months and about 750 hours to achieve the feat. He even documented his experience on YouTube.

In an interview with Vice‘s Patrick Klepek, the man behind this feat, Thomas (name changed as he didn’t want to be named publicly) said,

“I always enjoyed just walking around the map and running into things and going ‘Oh, that’s not on the map.” He added, “That always sparked my interest.”

He also mentioned that every location has a story, but it depends on the player how he comes up with it.

“You just have to make up your own mind on what happened,” he said.

He also shared some crazy details about how he begun this insane task, challenges he faced, and the secrets he found while doing so.

Continued

Initially he started making the videos for himself and archived them in YouTube. His videos were watched by a very less amount of people until one of his friends suggested him to submit his YouTube channel on Reddit. The idea worked out and he now has more that 4,000 subscribers.

“It’s very motivating to have those dedicated people,” he said. “One of them even referred to me as a daily routine, because I release a video almost every day. […] I went in the space of month from having 20 subscribers, half of which were family, to about 4,000 people. [laughs] A lot of them cared more about where I was and what I was doing more so than my family.”

Thomas also mentioned that Fallout: New Vegas was his first open world or Role Playing Game experience.

“My grandma just said ‘Do you want a game?’ and took me down to the game store,” he said. He added, “Fallout: New Vegas was just sitting there on the shelf. […] Have you seen the cover of Fallout: New Vegas yourself? It’s pretty cool. None of the other games looked that cool, so I went ‘Oh, I’ll pick that one.'”

He fell in so much love with Fallout: New Vegas that he missed schools and played the game for more than 400 hours.

“Had to be done,” he laughed.

That 400 hours with Fallout: New Vegas was just the start. He spent more than 1000 hours with Skyrim and explored every dungeon, bought every possible item and did every possible thing in the game.

“For some reason, these kinds of RPGs, open world games, I just have to complete it,” he said. “That’s why I’m not allowed near World of Warcraft, just in case. [laughs]”

At this moment Thomas has started a video series for Skyrim that’s similar to the Fallout 4. In the near future he plans to explore the optional locations in Fallout 4 DLCs, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Skyrim.

Thomas said it’s going to take him more than two years to achieve the goals if he does a video a day.",This Fallout 4 player spent 750 hours playing the game to complete this insane challenge
Playable female soldiers. ,https://fraghero.com/modern-warfare-remastered-just-added-incredible-feature-original-never/,"Activision have finally done something that people have been waiting for for a long time, and that’s adding playable female soldiers to the game.

Plenty of women play CoD: MW and totally own you on a daily basis, but you’d have on idea because every character is a man in the game. Granted, some women will definitely want to keep playing as the male avatars, because putting up a huge banner saying “I’M A WOMAN” in an online FPS can lead to even more harassment than everyone is already subject to in the game. Yes it’s just a game, yes it’s not real, but why not have the option to play as a character that at least matches your gender, if you’d like to?

In any case, it’s about time that this option existed in Modern Warfare, and it’s hard to fault Activison for going back in time to correct the omission. If they were adding front-line female combatants into a World War 2 shooter, for example, that might be kind of strange, but this is Modern Warfare. Female characters aren’t the only addition to the remastered version, however, Activision has also controversially added micro-transactions.

Here are some reactions from around the web about this latest addition:

“CoD is about 360 noscoping and teabagging… I don’t think it’s that important whether female models exist or not. So, I guess, my thoughts are “meh”.” – GreatBaldung “Cue the “Modern Warfare is promoting violence towards women” articles.” – TouchMyPokemon “Assassin’s Creed multiplayer had female characters from the get-go, back in 2010.” – Kovitlac “Why couldn’t they just give you the ability to play as a woman at the start of the game? I mean it doesn’t change the game to get that skin early on so what’s the point of unlocking it randomly?”

This isn’t the first time that a Call of Duty game has featured female soldiers, however. While series’ like Halo and Gears of War have had playable women for quite a while, it took Call of Duty longer to catch on, first bringing in the option for Ghosts.

"Nowhere does it state what these two games are. Only that these two games are big, and will developed alongside TES6 and that they will probably come out before TES6. ",https://fraghero.com/bethesdas-two-unannounced-games-are-massive-just-like-fallout-4-and-skyrim/,"Bethesda has confirmed to be working on two games that are different from their normal routine of Fallout and Skyrim. Todd Howard said earlier this year that they’re “different than anything we [Bethesda] have ever done, but they’re still going to feel like a Bethesda Game Studios game.”

During E3 this year, Bethesda’s main voice to the people, the VP of public relations, Pete Hines, commented further on what Todd said. He went on to say that these are two big titles in the works alongside The Elder Scrolls 6, and he clarified that they are not DLC, in case anyone was under that assumption.

Hines said, “I need folks to understand that we’re talking about big games like a Skyrim and a Fallout 4 and a Fallout 3 and those don’t just happen.”

Completely unlike Bethesda’s typical procedure of going silent for years and years about upcoming games, it seems the company is changing tracks now, opting for being more open.

Todd Howard also issued a statement regarding the development of Elder Scroll VI.

Todd Howard even confirmed himself that Elder Scrolls 6 was already in the works, but he was sure to mention that we shouldn’t expect it before the other two mystery projects. This was later reinforced by Pete Hines as well.

Given that Howard mentioned previously that they were “working on three new games,” it’s safe to assume that one is Elder Scrolls 6, and two are the mystery games we’ve been talking about. Just wanted to clarify that, as not to mislead anyone into thinking there’s another game.

Considering the time and effort that typically goes into a Bethesda game, you’ll have to be held over by Fallout 4‘s newly announced DLC, as well as a 2017 release of Fallout 4 on VR, and of course, Skyrim: Special Edition.",Bethesda is developing two new games much bigger than Skyrim
Lichdom Battlemage. It just hasn't ported over well from PC to Console ,https://fraghero.com/this-is-the-worst-ps4xbox-one-game-this-generation-has-seen/,"Gamers often have the task of trying to decide what platform to play a game on: PC or console. Sometimes it really does not make a huge difference in regards to features, quality, or even the community. However, when it comes to Lichdom: Battlemage, the answer is clear to keep it PC.

This game was released on Xbox One and Playstation 4 on April 19 2016, nearly two years after its initial release on PC.

There have been many successful games making the move from PC to console and vice versa, but this one was nothing short of a disaster.

After viewing DigitalFoundry’s YouTube video demonstrating this FUBAR of a console debut, I decided to watch some streamers on Twitch to see it for myself; sadly, they were not wrong. It’s rough.

Continued

The frame rate of this game barely gets to 15fps, and that’s intermittent. There are ridiculous loading times. The Xbox One version displays significantly darker than the PS4 and PC versions. I couldn’t watch more than 10 minutes of an Xbox One streamer before pouring myself a glass of wine to calm my nerves from irritability.

It was almost unbearable to watch. The PS4 streamer had a little cleaner quality but you could still tell that the frame rate was lethargic. I enjoyed watching the PC streamer because there were no issues with textures loading in slowly, frame rate dips, or excessive lag.

This is CryEngine 3’s first game running in full 1080p resolution for the Xbox One. Although this is progression for them, it does raise a flag in regards to playable quality. With nearly two years in between PC and console releases, there should have been more testing and tweaking before releasing it on Xbox One and PS4.

Maximum Games might be the real culprits, though, since they conducted the port. The company did release an announcement about wanting the improve the game to make it more enjoyable for its players, touching on poor frame rates and achievements not unlocking properly.

It’s disappointing because this game looks really fun to play. As a huge FPS fan that has a love for mage-type characters, I would be inclined to spend the $49.99 on it if I didn’t already know that the poor quality would make me want to break my controller in half.",This is the worst PS4/Xbox One videogame to have ever released
Fastest marriage (3 minutes 37 seconds). ,https://fraghero.com/skyrim-player-has-officially-made-the-weirdest-videogame-record-ever/,"There is a saying that you shouldn’t rush into marriages. However, there is a contest in Skyrim which needs the players to speed-run all the way for marrying as fast as they can.

I have seen a lot of instances of speed-running in the past but this is the funniest/weirdest of all. There is an entire category of speed-running, where the players need to get married as quickly as possible right after the start of the game.

The chart is now led by Twitch streamer 5exual_Tyrannosaurus, who managed to marry Marcurio of Riften in just 3:37. That was really fast and Marcurio is definitely a lucky spouse.

Apart from this incredible achievement, 5exual_Tyrannosaurus has also achieved another incredible feat in the game, which is perhaps even tougher to imagine.

He completed Skyrim’s story in just 33:06 and claimed the trophy just a couple of days ago.

When I was wondering how 5exual_Tyrannosaurus managed to achieve these incredible feats at such a less amount of time, I came across a statement of speedrunner DrTChops.

He mentioned, “There is a glitch where if you start a sprint, quicksave, then end the sprint and quickload at the same time you keep the speed of the sprint.”

If you closely notice both the videos above, you’ll be able to find out that there is a small pause just at the start of the video. Well, I have got my answers now.

Apart from the above glitch, there are some more speed run glitches which are at work. Here’s a video by Fivexual, which explains how to make dialogue skips and load warping.

Glitches or not, it’s great to see these people make these absurd records while we leisurely play the game at our own pace.",A Skyrim player has officially made the most bizarre videogame record ever
"GTA Online. They are focussing on making it better. Which is no revelation to me, how about you guys? ",https://fraghero.com/rumor-rockstars-dropped-gta-v-single-player-dlc-plans-for-this-outrageous-reason/,"Over the years, Rockstar has been very dedicated about bringing in more and more regular content to Grand Theft Auto Online, the standalone edition to GTA V.

On the other hand, the single player segment hasn’t witnessed a single DLC release since the game launched. Rockstar had gone on record that it would be releasing singleplayer content for the game. That was back in 2013.

To make matters even worse, a new rumor suggests that Grand Theft Auto V’s story DLC has been discarded entirely in a move to bring more content to another popular element of the game.

And yes, we did say completely which means there won’t be any Single player DLC for the game, ever. And the reason isn’t fair as well.

Rockstar has cancelled all its plans to make any kind of Single player DLC for GTA V in order to focus completely on making its standalone online component called GTA Online better.

The rumor adds that there will be new updates coming to GTA Online which has already been confirmed to operate beyond 2020. Just like the GTA Online’s Executives and Other Criminals update, the game will also get new maps.

These maps will be the updated versions of San Fiero, Las Venturas, Vice City and Liberty City.

SOFTSECRETS, the source of the rumor has also claimed that Rockstar has been working on these updates since a long time, but were paused in between due to the limitations of the PS3 and Xbox 360.

SOFTSECRETS however hasn’t revealed anything about the source of the original information. But people believe that the rumor might carry some weight because it was posted back in August and they predicted the Biker DLC accurately.

Moreover, Rockstar pretty much confirmed that it had cancelled development of story DLC when Director of Design at Rockstar North Imran Sarwar spoke to IGN in September 2015.

Right now our focus is on GTA Online which has exceeded our expectations,” Sarwar said. “We currently have all key members of the team that launched Grand Theft Auto 5 focused on supporting GTA Online in every capacity.

If this rumor indeed proves to be accurate, expect a lot more GTA Online content in the coming weeks and months and some of them being the size of expansion packs.

On the flipside, you can consider the single player aspect of the game goodbye as there won’t be any new DLC packs to accomodate new content for single-player enthusiasts.",Rumor: Rockstar has dropped GTA V single player DLC plans for this ridiculous reason

There’s not a person in sight near this lighthouse except for a single house nearby.

That house is the resident of a deranged women who murmurs really strange things if you go and try to speak with her. There’s been many rumors about the lighthouse with different players reporting different occurrences when being there.

These range from people claiming to see ghost ships sailing nearby the lighthouse to seeing a ghost of a lady. Others have claimed to have seen a spirit of a old man who was apparently murdered by the lady living in the house.

A youtuber called It’s Tiny Troll has decided that merely statements won’t be enough to uncover the mystery about this lighthouse, and he decided to spend an entire night at the location and record his findings.

What he found is honestly very disturbing.

To start off, he noticed that the lights of the nearby house where the mentally challenged lady resided switched on and off by themselves. When he went to inspect closer he couldn’t find anything else.

However, he also spotted what looked like a man near the lighthouse during one of the power outages. It’s not clear who the person was or if he wasn’t a person at all but a ghost.

Micro transactions. ,https://fraghero.com/activision-adds-one-hated-features-modern-warfare-remastered/,"Define “remastered”.

Activision has another hit on their hands with Infinite Warfare, where they managed to bring some former fans back on board with the inclusion of Modern Warfare: Remastered.

However, they’ve taken certain creative liberties this time around, and added some things that weren’t in the original game.

Some of these features were appreciated by the fanbase and some were even considered as solid new additions, however, the recent mega update that it released for the game, has bought along a particular feature that fans aren’t happy about.

Fans have been vocal about their displeasure at Activision’s decision to add this dreaded featured, and has gone to the extent of saying that it has no place in the game since the original didn’t include it.

MICROTRANSACTIONS!

MW: Remastered now featured an idiot tax in the form of microtransactions, where you can buy supply drops containing cosmetic items like new character skins and weapon camo. At a certain point, we can’t even blame publishers for this, because it’s obviously a viable revenue source for them. It’s our fault that this happened. Every single one of us that has ever pulled out the credit card for a microtransaction is to blame.

But at least this time, it could be worse…

Any of the cosmetic items that you can purchase with real money can also be acquired using the in-game currency that you can earn by playing the game, the good old fashioned way. This could be a lot worse, for example, if it went beyond items that were purely cosmetic and started having an impact on game play, and if the upgrades weren’t available without paying money. Thankfully, we’re not at that point yet, but hopefully they aren’t reading this article and getting any ideas.

Microtransactions weren’t the only additions in the December update, it also included the 6 multiplayer maps that were missing from the initial release, which launched with only 10 out of 16. They’re also added in Gun Game and Hardpoint modes.

As of now, Modern Warfare: Remastered is still only available as a bonus for purchasing the Legacy, Legacy Pro, or Digital Deluxe versions of Infinite Warfare.",Activision adds one of the most hated features to Modern Warfare: Remastered
"The dead body of a gangster who looks like Cole Phelps, the main character from LA Noire. ",https://fraghero.com/gta-v-player-discovers-secret-mine-game-finds-scary-thing-inside/2/,"Grand Theft Auto V is full of secrets and Rockstar Games is known to put down small easter eggs that aren’t really pleasing but can be connected to some of its earlier games if you can put the pieces together.

The next-gen version of GTA V which released for PS4 and Xbox One contains one such secret. Several players have uncovered this rather disturbing secret in the game which involves you finding a mine.

The mine isn’t accessible from the get go and you’ll need a couple of grenades to blow up the entrance. Make you are far from it or the debris can end up killing you. Once inside the mine, it’s very dark and hence make sure you take a flashlight with you.

What awaits inside is something that noone could’ve seen coming and also if you’ve played an earlier Rockstar Games developer title, it might actually make sense to you.

The mine has a dead body inside and the guy is fully dressed in what looks like a Mafia gang member outfit. However, that may not be who he is. If you’ve played L.A Noire, another game made by Rockstar, you’ll know Cole Phelps, the main character of the game.

Cole Phelps was a detective who wore a similar outfit and died at the end of the game inside a mine after drowning in it. Could Rockstar have intentionally put this body inside the mine as a easter egg for the game?

The outfit and the hat also matches with the one Cole wore in the game. Check out the video.","GTA V player finds secret mine, discovers something he never expected inside"

It also announced a brand new Quake game during the press conference.

Despite all this, one thing that the fans missed during the press conference was the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6.

Most of the fans expected the game to be announced during the event owing to the fact that Skyrim protagonist Dragonborn’s image was featured in Bethesda’s E3 promo images.

However, even though the game was not announced during the event, Bethesda boss Todd Howard confirmed that the game is in works in his own special way.

Speaking to Geoff Keighley during a “Youtube Live at E3” interview, Howard let the cat out of the bag:

It’s good in these moments to tell our fans, ‘Yes, of course we are [making The Elder Scrolls 6]. It’s something we love.’ But it is–you know, I have to be careful what I say–it’s a very long way off.” He added, “I could sit here and explain the game to you, and you would say, ‘That sounds like you don’t even have the technology–how long is that going to take?”

Howard also said they are working on two more projects which will be revealed before The Elder Scrolls 6, which means the latter won’t be coming anytime soon.

Vice President of PR and Marketing at Bethesda, Pete Hines, tweeted that he jokes with Todd Howard The Elder Scrolls 6 will release on 22/22/22. He also added that “our robot overlords will change our calendar system by the time it comes out.”

It covers the bite mark on her arm. ,https://fraghero.com/finally-know-ellie-got-tattoo-last-us-2/,"Naughty Dog pleasantly surprised the gaming community by announcing The Last of Us 2 during Sony’s PlayStation Experience event earlier this month.

Sequel to one of the most critically acclaimed videgames ever made, Naughty Dog has a gigantic task at hand to live upto fan expectations.

The reveal trailer delivered and how, with people showering it with praises, from the feel, to the direction, the trailer seemed to nail down everything. Fans also couldn’t help but notice one major addition to the game: Ellie’s new tattoo.

The trailer heavily focused on Ellie’s hand which now had an elaborate tattoo. Even though the game’s set in a post-apocalyptic world, the tattoo’s quite decent.

However, it’s not just a fancy body art for Ellie. The tattoo actually serves a greater purpose.

As you know, Ellie was beaten by the infected as a teenager along with her best friend. Although her best friend turned into a monster but Ellie wasn’t affected. She was immune to the virus, or atleast it didn’t affect her in the same way it did to others.

However, the bite left a mark on her and in a world where the infected are dreaded mutants, it’s not good to carry such a mark. Almost everyone who notices it and isn’t infected, would shoot you instantly, without even asking any questions.

Therefore, the tattoo made for a great cover up. The tattoo is actually hiding her bite mark if you pay close attention, and therefore Ellie actually has a reason for getting a tattoo done other than it being just a piece of art.",We finally know why Ellie got a tattoo in The Last of Us 2

Needless to say, the trailer was really well executed and had people’s excitement levels reach an all time high. The Last of Us was one of the most critically acclaimed games made last generation, and fans were really looking forward to experiencing a second installment.

However, one thing that made a lot of die-hard fans think, was how Joel was shown in the reveal trailer.

What’s more, it also gave birth to an insane theory about him and how he’s going to be featured in the game.

According to the theory, Joel is dead in The Last of Us 2, having been killed by the fireflies and Ellie is out seeking revenge due to it. It’s not all hogwash as the theory gives some compelling evidence that can be noticed in the trailer. We’ve summarized them below.

Joel doesn’t look older in the trailer or shows any sign of ageing. He actually looks younger. Ellie is severely bruised in the trailer but there is no visible injury marks on Joel. Joel is extremely calm entering a house full of dead bodies and doesn’t seem concerned about Ellie’s well being.

The theory claims that Joel is nothing but a fragment of Ellie’s imagination in The Last of Us 2, who’ll speak to her throughout the game while she seeks out revenge. Although this theory sounds insane, but it might actually come true.

Since the last couple of weeks more and more details have been emerging about Bioware’s highly anticipated space RPG Mass Effect: Andromeda. Recently, it has been revealed that one of the game’s race has a really bad name.

In the Mass Effect trilogy, the different races had played important roles – the Turians were really clever, the Elcor were emotionally vocal, and the Humans were really terrifying.

However, the upcoming Mass Effect game features a race, named ‘Kett’, which is actually translated into something really absurd if you go by the actual meaning of it.

The word ‘Kett’ is actually a widely used slang in the UK that means ‘shit’. Basically, it’s quite a shitty name to choose for a race.

We bet they wouldn’t find it funny if they knew some humans making a game chose to name their race with such a disgusting name. Well, we kid, but still, not the best name, is it?",This Mass Effect: Andromeda alien race has the worst possible name ever
According to players the patch downgraded the game. Frame rates and textures looked less impressive than before the patch. ,https://fraghero.com/new-battlefield-1-update-has-players-outraged-for-doing-this-terrible-change-to-ps4-pro-version/,"Image: www.battlefield.com

An extensive title update came to Battlefield 1 yesterday. The players, however aren’t happy with the update and complained that the patch downgrades the PS4 Pro-enhanced version of the game.

The new patch, 1.04 went live on yesterday afternoon and has been under-performing on Sony’s new upgraded console PlayStation 4 Pro.

One of the fans even inquired with DICE engineer Julian Manolov about the enhancements brought in the patch. Manolov, however replied that they were currently under an NDA with Sony and Microsoft which prevents them from sharing any details about the nature of enhancements.



Several users, on the other hand posted on the social media and forums about the game’s downgraded performances after the patch. Some have provided near conclusive evidence too. We’ve compiled the most noteworthy ones below.

NeoGAF user Arthur-Hucksake said, “Jaggy shimmer is now present and a softer image all round. The frames don’t feel as smooth, either.”

Another user named Hurley added: “Just had a few games then on the pro and it does seem like the fps and image quality has taken a bit of a hit. Fps isn’t too bad but it doesn’t feel as smooth as pre-patch.” Jakartalado also went on to comment: “It looks bland, and soft. Textures look blurry.”

One user provided further evidence how the latest patch might have downgraded the PS4 Pro version

BLAUCopter stated: “Was playing all afternoon pre patch and not only does it look softer post patch it runs worse too. Just go play Argonne Forest and run around. There’s definitely a performance hit.”

According to some other users, the developers might have just overwritten the Pro mode flag when they were implementing the temporal anti-aliasing (TAA), which is even detailed in the patch notes. This means that the game is now launching in the base ‘PS4 mode’ instead of the ‘PS4 Pro mode’.

In the meantime, some users are still having fun with the game, this sniper is so good many people claimed he was cheating on social media:

"Nothing. This article is a work of fiction for their ""weekly satire"" posts. ",https://fraghero.com/you-wouldnt-believe-what-rockstar-announced-for-gta-vi/3/,"Since the popular release of GTA V in September 2013, fans of Rockstar Games have been kept in the dark about the details of the next installment of the series.

Many fans have speculated that GTA V would be the last installment due to the ambiguously named “GTA Online” – a name which implies that future installments, at least of a multiplayer variety, are not to be expected.

However, new information from a multitude of sources has been leaked about the next installment in Rockstar Games’ headlining series, including specifics about the game’s setting, plot, features and functionality. As with any pre-release information, this is subject to interpretation and change.

Though no release date has been confirmed, GTA 6 has been confirmed to release sometime in the future. The exact date will likely be two years ahead of the initial estimated release date set by Rockstar, to give them time to “polish” the final copy and deliver an experience fans are sure to enjoy, despite their discontent while waiting twenty-four months more than they should have.

More details have also leaked, read on to know how Rockstar Games plans to make GTA VI the best game the universe has ever seen. (No, really)

GTA 6 will feature a main character – or characters – that players will be forced to control if they wish to play the game. These lead characters will be voiced by an actor, or actors, who will have exponentially more witty dialogue and banter than any of the side characters or miscellaneous pedestrians because they’re just naturally more intelligent, funny, and bulletproof.

The graphics are rumored to be an improvement on those of GTA V, and the physics engine and AI functionality will also be improved to prevent drivers who accidentally run over player characters from reversing and running them over six more times.

Though unconfirmed, there are also reports that large vehicles capable of towing will also no longer take off like the Apollo 13 rocket when attached to a trailer and touched by anything more forceful than a hummingbird.

Much to the disappointment of many players, the game will not be released on PS1 or the Nintendo 64. This has led to uproar among fans who insist their older consoles are “just as good” as next-gen platforms and they shouldn’t lose out on content just because they don’t have access to their parents’ money or the motivation to get a job and buy a newer system.

Though a multiplayer aspect has been rumored, players will require an online connection in order to access it. The stability of the online mode has been put up for debate, however, as almost all online features will also require a connection to Rockstar’s servers which are known to go down faster and more frequently than a cheerleader on prom night.

Some of the game’s shops will have humorous names such as “All Of My Stock is Legal” or “Totally Legitimate Medicinal Marijuana Dispensary.” This has already incited anger among Liberal media and social justice activists for being offensive and an unfair representation of multiple minorities as well as the entirety of the country.

The game will feature a radio with multiple stations, many of which play various kinds of music. Some will also feature talk radio shows, which will undoubtedly annoy every side character, prostitute and ally who enters your vehicle to the point of suicide.

Despite fan conspiracy theories, the game is confirmed to be set on the planet Earth and will not feature laser guns, hybrid jetpacks, alien invasions, or any other galactic planetary entity as a playable area.

Finally, the game will feature mature content, such as receiving fully-clothed sexual acts from sentient plastic dolls, senselessly murdering obese Midwestern tourists for yelling obscenities at you, and partial nudity which will undoubtedly be repeatedly photographed and uploaded to Rockstar’s Social Club by twelve-year-old children obsessing over an animated nipple, or worse, a seventy-year-old altruist’s kibbles and bits.

In addition to these features, Rockstar is said to have multiple downloadable content bundles in the works, which will be free to download but contain items so ludicrously expensive in game currency that microtransactions will be necessary to own anything more than your grandmother’s Buick and an airsoft pistol.

"Tokyo, Chicago & London. ",https://fraghero.com/3-cities-reportedly-considered-gta-6/,"With the existence of GTA 6 promoting more mystery and rumours than any other game out there at the moment, there is one thing that remains at the core of gamers and fans minds when thinking about a new installment. Where will it be set? Even though GTA 5 is still doing well online. It’s forward that Rockstar will be looking.

There’s been a few inklings so far. To name one, could Tokyo by the next blueprint for Rockstar’s series? Maybe. Here’s a few cities that may be the next location for the epic that GTA 6 will surely be.

We look at three possible locations where the game might be going in its sixth installment.

Tokyo:

As mentioned above, Tokyo could definitely be in with a shot at the next prime GTA location. With it’s intoxicating mix of tight streets and neon night-sky, it would showcase the visuals of the game and its graphical capabilities. A good indicator of this is by the different mods that have been released so far for the older GTA 5.

It would also make sense in a story-sense as Tokyo has a criminal underworld led by factions of the Yakuza. But is this too similar to the Hong Kong of Sleeping Dogs? Even though that was set in China, it does seem aesthetically alike. It would still be an interesting shift from West to East, however.

Chicago:

John Dillinger. Al Capone. Frankie Yale. The Windy City is known for its mirrored giant Bean sculpture as much as its violent past. Chicago used to be a town of blood and bullets and this would make a fitting context for a GTA game.

Especially in an updated fashion. It would also make sense being set in the U.S itself as GTA has also been a great parody of America as a country.

London:

It wouldn’t be new to the GTA series, but it would make more a welcome return. It would also make sense to go back in time like Vice City did. If GTA returns to London, it would most likely be that of a different era.

London would also be a perfect premise to stir up a lot more controversies that are common with the U.K and EU.",3 cities GTA VI might take place in that you never thought was possible

We’re giving this girl a live audition to be our Fraghero Twitch Streamer

Watch live video from Schmitkit on www.twitch.tv

We have come across a rather bizarre rumor (Via, Gamology) that GTA VI could be an Xbox-exclusive game.

The rumor mentions that the next installment of Grand Theft Auto could be a Project Scorpio exclusive game. The game, which is expected to feature VR elements haven’t been confirmed by Rockstar yet. In the last couple of months, several sources suggested that GTA VI has been facing numerous delays.

This rumor that GTA VI will be a Project Scorpio exclusive is highly unlikely as Microsoft will have to pay millions for this highly popular game to be exclusive to its console only. On the other hand, the pool of players with a PlayStation console is larger than that of Xbox, which could easily make Rockstar think against the idea.

Microsoft is currently focused more in developing first party games like Forza, Scalebound, etc. rather than the third party exclusive titles. So, we can almost be certain that the rumor is false.",Rumor: GTA VI will be a console exclusive for this major brand
"The Game is unsupported on unlocked, rooted, or jail broken devices. ",https://fraghero.com/lot-of-pokemon-go-players-demanding-refunds-after-latest-update-due-to-this-reason/,"Image: portalhoy.com

A warning that the game would no longer be supported in unlocked, rooted or jail-broken devices was already given by Niantic before the latest Pokemon Go update. However, some of the players didn’t seem impressed with this decision.

A message, which reads, “This device, OS, or software is not compatible with Pokémon Go,” are shown in the jailbroken phones.

The players who are facing this issue are now asking for their money back. A Reddit post, made by a user in this regard was highly upvoted. The user mentioned about his experience with the Google customer service while he tried to get the refund for his Pokemon Go in-app purchases.

GnothiSeauton, the creator of the original post said, “I wouldn’t have had a problem with [the update booting jailbroken/rooted/unlocked phones] if they blocked rooted users from launch.” “However, doing it 2 months into the [game] show after rooted users have invested time and money into the game, is completely unscrupulous,” he added.

There is only a little hope for the players who spent money on Pokemon Go to get back their money by using this type of protest.

Niantic has taken this strict step to decrease cheating in the game, which is obviously understandable. However, some of the players think that rooting the phone is no crime as many people roots their Android devices to make them more customizable. On the other hand, there are also people who buy unlocked phone to avoid some extra charges.

Some workarounds for the Android users facing this issue has come up on various gaming websites and forums. One of such popular method is to install another program in the phone which can give you back the access to the game. You can read more about the method here.

Pokemon Go is back on track with the release of the Buddy update, after the drastic downfall it had seen over the course of the last month.

"$120. $70 for the game, $50 for all the DLC ",https://fraghero.com/gamer-figures-out-how-much-the-full-battlefield-1-game-costs-and-its-outrageous/,"Image: www.battlefield.com

Over the past few years, video gaming has become an expensive hobby. The game companies are now releasing incomplete titles which thoroughly lacks content and then releases paid DLCs.

This new strategy from the companies dig holes in the pockets of the gamers. There’s an option of buying a season pass for the game, which gives access to the expansions, but they too are very expensive.

DICE, the creator of the much anticipated title Battlefield 1, has also used the strategy for the game. To get the full experience of Battlefield 1 you’ll have to shell out a total amount of $120, which is huge.

The price of the base game is $70, but if you want to have all the expansions that’ll come next year you’ll have to pay another $50. Apart from that, the game will have a lot of micro transactions, where you can spend more money.

On the other hand, if you want to get a collector’s edition of the game, get ready to spend an amount as huge as $220. The collector’s edition will have a Collector’s Edition Statue which is 14 inch tall, a steel book, a deck of playing cards, a messenger pigeon tube, a cloth poster, exclusive DLC content, an exclusive patch and a copy of Deluxe Edition of the game.

What is ironic here is that Patrick Back, senior producer of DICE, in an interview with Xbox World 360 had said:

“We don’t ever want to charge for our maps and insisted to EA that this attitude was crucial when it came to keeping our community happy and playing together.”

Six years down the line, DICE is completely contradicting with their own statement and joined hands with EA in minting more and more money.

Apart from Battlefield 1, there are several other games which uses the same formula and exploits the players for more money. If this goes on, the main essence of gaming will soon be lost in the wilderness.

It's certainly not illegal yet. ,http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/04/is-pokemon-go-even-legal?page=2,"Pokemon Go has taken over the world, raking in tons of money for both The Pokemon Company and local businesses. But its location-based play has raised many questions about the safety and legality of a game that asks large groups to perform specific actions in public spaces.

What happens when a Gym is placed on top of someone’s front yard? When a lure is dropped in the center of a quiet neighborhood? When someone unwittingly injures themselves on private property? One lawsuit has already been filed against Niantic after a New Jersey man accused Pokemon Go of encouraging strangers to trespass outside his home — will more follow?

“The biggest concern is that you’re getting a ton of people out in public that would not otherwise [have] been out there,” Josh King, Chief Legal Officer of Avvo Legal Services told IGN. “[They’re] interacting with each other, and interacting with a physical environment, and so all of the laws that apply in the real world still apply, even though you’ve got this augmented reality situation going on.”

“ King “would not be surprised” if someone eventually contested it in court.

With a specialty in media law, King often works on cases that correlate in some way to the first amendment. He notes that the amendment does more to protect the players than businesses.

“It’s important to remember that everyone’s got a first amendment right to associate intangible objects or concepts with tangible things, and that’s what’s really happening when you assign a PokeStop, a [Pokemon randomly appears], or you have a gym,” he explains.

“Whatever the case may be, ultimately you’re associating intangible objects or ideas with tangible things.”

Loading

This means that it’s completely legal for game developers to layer fictional animals or items on top of someone’s real business.

“ The most likely grievance to be filed would be a nuisance suit.

“I’m hopeful that a lot of this will lead to greater and more beneficial social interaction between players,” he says. “But, you’re certainly going to have cases — at least on the fringes — of people who will abuse the system, or there are going to be confrontations and situations that happen.

“And ultimately, they just need to be aware of their surroundings and mindful of the choices they make.”

Loading

So, what does happen when a Gym is placed on someone’s front lawn and their otherwise quiet neighborhood is suddenly overrun with anxious would-be trainers in the middle of the day? Pokemon Go tends to cause people to congregate, which can be a big issue in smaller areas not used to sustaining so many people all at once.

“Game players will have to be careful of that,” he says, encouraging people to practice discretion when entering into a private or residential area.

According to him, the most likely grievance to be filed would be a nuisance suit, which would address the noise or large presence of non-residents in the area disturbing the peace.

He compares a nuisance claim to that of a person complaining about a particularly loud or rowdy neighbor.

Basically, it can be classified as “something happening off your property that impacts your enjoyment of your property.” Whether it’s teens smoking or a bad DJ at a graduation party, any sort of noise level or guest number has the potential to be the base of a nuisance suit.

Something of this caliber could potentially be used to go after the developers of Pokemon Go, he says, then adds that the recently-added feature to opt out of being a designated stop or gym helps offset that possibility.

It’s not just private residences that have been roped into the game. Many businesses have seen Pokemon Go as an incredible opportunity to draw in customers and have begun dropping lures and offering discounts for the various players who might pass through.

Having an influx of people is fundamentally a good thing, but with more people comes a higher risk of injury or claims to be levied on the owners of a business. So, what can they do to protect themselves from the risk of litigation? As King sees it, the laws currently on the books should be more than enough to suffice for now.

Loading

“ ""People need to be able to balance [playing and being aware of their surroundings].""

But what about the players themselves? There have been multiple instances of predators planting lures and using them as a way to draw people in, only to rob or assault them once they show up. In case this happens, what can the player do?

According to King, it’s not necessarily a difficult thing to avoid. In fact, as we talk to him, he continues to return to one major suggestion: be aware of your surroundings at all times.

Loading

“Ultimately, people need to be able to balance [playing and being aware of their surroundings],” he said. “They have to be mindful of their surroundings, careful about where they’re going, and that’s true of how you would interact with someone else or chasing a Pokemon.”

“ “I would not be surprised to see some changes with administrative law.""

We often don’t consider how things may need to change in the face of new tech until long after it arrives. Although we have a decent grip on what virtual reality is here in 2016, we’re still very much learning about augmented reality, and how its ability to immediately add context and meaning to real life can lead us into some very interesting territory. How will it affect us, and how will it impact the laws, if at all?

“I would not be surprised to see some changes with administrative law,” he says, pointing specifically to intellectual property and contributory negligence as being some of the biggest concerns.

Loading

As for Pokemon Go? It’s mostly fun and games, King says. Sure, there are some concerns that arise alongside of it, but the benefits of hunting adorable made-up creatures in the real world far outweigh the potential negatives.

“ Be conscious and courteous of your surroundings.

“It’s not necessarily a bad thing; it’s good for people to be out in public getting exercise and talking to other people, getting social, and [the handful] of other helpful things we’ve seen out of this game.”

Step 1: At first, you’ll need to use the items in normal ways. Simply use the Lucky Egg to gain double XP for the next 30 minutes, or use the Incense to attract Pokemon towards your location. You can either use both these items together or use one at a time.

Step 2: After the Step 1 is completed, exit the Pokemon Go app and move over to the ‘Settings’ option of your Android or iOS device. Go to the ‘date and time’ setting in the ‘Settings’ option.

Step 3: Toggle off the option which allows to set the date and time of the device automatically.

Step 4: Once the automatic setting is turned off, roll back the time in the device by around 25 minutes. Make sure you don’t set back the time by more than 30 minutes. Doing this will increase the amount of time your Lucky Egg or Incense has before running out.

Step 5: After completing Step 4, head back to the Pokemon Go app and you’ll find that the time left on Lucky Egg or Incense has been increased by the number of minutes you rolled back in the ‘date and time’ settings.

This trick is very effective and will help you in getting unlimited access to both Lucky Eggs and Incense. Players that have difficulty collecting gym defender bonuses and that don’t want to spend real money on the game will definitely find this trick useful.

Their sales projections are less than the average battlefield sales figures. ,https://fraghero.com/ea-admits-battlefield-1-might-fall-short-previous-games-one-department/,"In a strange twist of events, it seems EA executives don’t see Battlefield 1 as the CoD killer everyone was hoping for. This was pretty much revealed in a post-earnings call, where company CFO Blake Jorgensen goes over some sales figures they’re predicting with the upcoming World War 1 game when it hits.

“We’ve told people that typically a Battlefield title does about 15 million in a year,” Jorgensen said. “Our guidance is slightly under that. And we hope that that excitement builds and it will clearly go through that number. But for right now, it’s slightly under that number.”

He also details a little info on Titanfall 2‘s predicted sales figures, in which he claims it will outsell it’s predecessor. This isn’t too surprising, however, considering Titanfall was an Xbox One exclusive, and the sequel is coming to all three platforms (XB1, PS4, PC). He says it’ll probably sell close to 10 million.

“We think it’ll do more than that, but it’s probably closer to 10 million than it is to 15 million as built into our guidance, so closer to 9 million to 10 million on [Titanfall 2] and just under 15 million on Battlefield 1.”

Interestingly, the two shooters will be released with a week of each other, with Battlefield 1 coming on October 21st and Titanfall 2 October 28th.

He went on record to say that the company might shut them down in the near future.

“People are only hurting themselves because it takes some fun out of the game,” he said. “People are hacking around trying to take data out of our system and that’s against our terms of service.”

That future has now arrived as the most popular tracking app, Pokevision, as well as several others have stopped working. This happened Saturday night and Forbes got in touch with one of the founders of Pokevision, Yangcheng Liu, who confirmed the site was intentionally taken down and might remain that way ‘indefinitely’. Liu refused to disclose whether Niantic or The Pokemon Company had sent them a legal notice.

Pokemon Go is a game where the players are required to travel across the real world in order to find Pokemon. Many people found these apps to be useful since it made the job of ‘catching them all’ easier, however Niantic’s terms of service did not allow this and the company itself feels that it takes the fun out of the game.

However, Niantic currently has no functional Pokemon tracking feature within the game after it decided to remove the location tracker system aka “the three step bug” entirely in an update it released yesterday. This prompted the emergence of these sites and they gained popularity quickly. Pokevision had 27 million people visit its website in only 5 days.

The decision to remove the system from the game wasn’t received well by the community, with many criticizing the company for doing so. To make matters worse, it also decided to block access to its server to third-party tracking apps that led to the demise of most of the websites.

There is some good news for you trainers out there who still want to gain an unfair advantage. Even though Niantic shut down access to their servers, there are some apps that use artificial intelligence and crowdsourcing to help you find rare Pokemon, Pokestops, and Gyms. Pokemon Go Maps is probably the best one out right now, developed by a former google engineer. Since Pokemon Go Maps is built without using any third party APIs it does not violate any Pokemon Go Terms of Service, and won’t jeopardize your account. Here’s where you can get it:",Pokevision and other Pokemon trackers shut down due to this reason
"Popular sites like Pokévision and Poké Radar might be taken down in the future. These sites violate Pokémon GO‘s terms of service since they take data from the game’s servers.

After a month of Pokémon GO being out, Niantic has finally come forth and addressed the issue with third-party means of helping players “catch ’em all.” They may be handy for players searching for Pokémon in their cities (especially since the “three step glitch” is still in full effect), but apparently these sites are breaking the rules in order to help Pokémon GO players.

John Hanke, CEO of Niantic, spoke with Forbes and mentioned that popular sites like Pokévision and Poké Radar might be taken down in the future. He also mentions that those sites violate Pokémon GO‘s terms of service since they take data from the game’s servers.

“We have priorities right now but they might find in the future that those things may not work. People are only hurting themselves because it takes some fun out of the game. People are hacking around trying to take data out of our system and that’s against our terms of service.”

Hopefully the priorities Hanke mentioned are to fix the infamous “three step glitch” and stabilizing the game’s servers, since those two things seem to be the biggest complaints players have.

Fans of the game are sure to be a little upset once Niantic cracks down on sites to aid in their Pokémon hunting, but one of the creators of Pokévision, Y.L., said he would be okay with taking down the site if he was asked to. He spoke to Tech Insider about the issue.

“If Niantic told us to shut PokéVision down, we would comply, absolutely. It is their game, and we respect that.”

Y.L. also mentioned that they were not trying to encourage cheating in the game when creating the site. Their goal was to make Pokémon GO more fun, enhancing the overall experience of the game.

“We’re here to complement the game, not make it easier.”

Team Instinct. ,https://fraghero.com/this-is-the-most-hated-team-in-pokemon-go/,"During Niantic’s Pokémon GO panel at SDCC, the three team leaders of the game were finally revealed. While the members of Team Valor and Team Mystic are pleasantly pleased with Candela and Blanche leading their teams, the members of Team Instinct have been a little indifferent about their team’s leader, Spark.

Even though he may not appear to be the strongest team leader, he definitely favors the Internet when it comes to memes. The hilarious creations that have graced the Pokémon GO community depict Spark as a goofy, fast food loving attention seeker, desperate for approval.

Despite the negativity that surrounds Team Instinct, Spark does appear to have an endearing side to him, sprinkled with some innocence. Take a look at some of the best Spark memes we’ve come across so far.

CANDELA: bet u can’t eat 15 crayons

SPARK: BET I CAN

BLANCHE: (sips coffee, checks to make sure 911 is still on speed dial, reads the paper) — ü (@klargtaako) July 25, 2016

i finally remembered who spark reminded me ofhttps://t.co/2YMVN12V6A — ya girl shan ❄️ (@_volvata) July 24, 2016

Team Instinct boy seems like the type of dude who ran outta styling gel like seven years ago and started using toothpaste instead — Bloody Honey (@BloodyBHoney) July 24, 2016

Despite the humor that surrounds Team Instinct, the team does seem to have an unfair disadvantage in comparison to Team Valor and Team Mystic. For starters, the Legendary bird that represents Team Instinct, Zapdos, appears to have the lowest damage per second (DPS) out of the three birds in Pokémon GO. Articuno, Legendary bird for Team Mystic, leads the trio with 14.8 DPS, followed by Moltres and Zapdos fighting at 9.52 and 8.33 DPS, respectively.

Secondly, Team Instinct has steadily been at the bottom of nearly every poll and survey regarding which team players have been choosing. The less players a team has in a city, the harder it is to maintain control of gyms.

Third, when you gather enough candy to evolve an Eevee, receiving a Jolteon as opposed to a Vaporeon or Flareon can be a little disappointing. Vaporeons are significantly stronger since they receive the most CP per power up out of the three Eeveelutions (+40 for Vaporeon, +39 for Flareon, and +31 for Jolteon). Their attacks provide more DPS than the other two, especially since their attacks are much quicker.

Team Instinct may have more of a challenge ahead of them in Pokémon GO, but that shouldn’t necessarily deter anyone from joining the team. They do have some badass electric type Pokémon supporting them, they carry around a sense of determination, and they don’t necessarily consider everything to be a dick measuring contest, which provides a sense of humility.",This is the most hated team in Pokemon Go

Speaking at ACGHK 2016 (via PSU) Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida confirmed that all PlayStation VR titles will be compatible with standard PS4 models.

“All the PSVR (and future) titles will be playable on (normal) PS4,” said Yoshida. “We believe that everyone can enjoy the entertainment content on PSVR. Not just gamers, but a lot more people enjoy PSVR.”

This is reassuring news to those worried that their launch console from 2013 may not be capable of operating Sony’s upcoming VR headset.

Hatching eggs. That's it. That's the secret method. ,https://fraghero.com/gamer-discovers-secret-method-to-catch-region-exclusive-pokemon-from-anywhere-in-the-world/,"In the immensely successful Pokémon Go, players all over the world are catching and battling all sorts of Pokémon, found in all sorts of places. Different locations yield different Pokémon, and in order to catch ’em all, you’ll need to visit a lot of different locations.

Or maybe not.

One player has been able to capture all 145 of the currently available Pokémon, including all of the region exclusives from Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan – where you can find, respectively, Mr. Mime, Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Farfetch’d.

How, you ask? It’s simple, but it’ll likely require a large amount of walking around, hatching eggs, and hoping for the best. One Trainer from California claims to have caught all 145 currently available Pokémon, including all region exclusives, by hatching eggs – 10km eggs, to be precise.

Essentially, this gave him the ability to capture all the region exclusive Pokémon without the need to find them in another country.

Speaking with Eurogamer, the player said the following: “My name is John Smith and I caught all my Pokémon in California.” He further elaborated, telling Eurogamer’s Tom Phillips that he’d done most of the searching in his hometown, Santa Rosa, and around San Francisco.

Smith uploaded a video on his YouTube channel, running us through his impressive Pokédex, and all 145 of his catches. He really did catch ’em all – for now at least.

Now, he is taking on the challenge of catching the rest of the virtual monsters found only in other parts of the world by going off on an international trip. The best part of it all? His trip is going to be free.

According to his iPhone Health App, he has traveled an average of 8 miles per day by walking since the game was released on July 6th. He said that during his hunting trips, he can be found roaming for the monsters until 2 a.m. to 5 a.m.

Aside from the exercise, he also claims that the game has helped him perform better at work. Working for a platform innovation company, Johnson felt he was able to apply what he learned in his gaming experience with Pokémon Go.

Incense spawn one Pokemon every five minutes. If the player can move 200 meters in between spawns the rate increases to one spawn per minute. So you will have to jog at about 12kph to get the most out of an incense. ,https://fraghero.com/this-hidden-trick-allows-you-to-use-incense-in-pokemon-go-more-effectively/,"In Pokemon Go, incense is used to tempt Pokemon to the location of the trainer from their general location. Players are generally seen using incense whenever they are at home, work or any other place where they are unable to take a stroll in search of Pokemon.

However, a Redditor called __isitin__ has discovered that the coding of Pokemon Go doesn’t help the players much who uses incense without any movement. Generally, incense spawns a Pokemon every five minutes when the players are not making any movement.

This spawning rate, however, can be increased to one per minute if the players manages to move 200 meters in between every spawn.

At that rate, the players will need to cover one kilometer in five minutes to get the maximum out of the Incense. The players will actually need to jog at a speed of 12 kilometer per hour to meet this target.

Although on paper they should be able to collect 30 Pokemon while travelling at this speed using incense, the server and the faulty tracking system of the game will reduce it to 10-15, which is also a good number.

So, it is advisable for players not to use the incense while sitting down or not making any movement. Incense is a rare item and the players will receive it for free only while leveling up, and therefore it makes more sense to use it along with the tips mentioned above to get far better results with your Pokemon catching escapades.",This hidden trick allows you to use incense in Pokemon Go more effectively

All Pokemon are harder to catch. ,https://fraghero.com/players-discover-major-change-in-pokemon-go-after-hitting-level-20/,"Pokémon GO players have been leveling up steadily since the game’s release, and it appears that there is currently a level cap of 40 in the popular mobile game. Each level provides a handful of rewards based on which level you have achieved, but it appears that’s not the only thing higher players are receiving.

Despite the advantage of acquiring higher level Pokémon in the wild and through evolution, there is something quite annoying that players over level 20 are having to encounter on a frequent basis. It looks like the game is making everything more difficult to catch, including those pesky low level Pidgeys and Rattatas.

It seems that these pocket monsters are starting to master the art of breaking out of Poké Balls; I guess they didn’t get the memo that the game is not necessarily a catch and release sport.

Redditor Riggnaros reached level 30 before most of the other players in the game, and he has been discussing this issue, among others, such as scaling the amount of XP earned and Pokémon diversity:

I dont know how their formula works, obviously, but I can promise you that once you hit mid 20s, you will start to notice even the most common of Pokemon have an abnormally high chance to evade capture. In no scenario should a 10cp Pidgey/Ratatta/Weedle be able to avoid capture from a lvl 29 Pokemon trainer, much less avoid it 5-8 times in the same battle (no exaggeration). From level 29-30 I went through over 1000 Pokeballs. Literally. I cannot stress how ridiculous this would be for someone playing w/o spending coins on Pokeballs (ie playing the game f2p – which is the majority). If they are expecting players to sit around and camp Pokestops for HOURS just to have enough ammo to grind their half a million xp (the requirement from 30-31, 500k), they need to rethink their approach.

As a frequent player of Pokémon GO, I’m about to hit level 20 and I can already see a huge difference in the ability to hang onto my catches. Even with the use of Razz Berries and Great Balls, Venonats and Weedles still break free constantly, even with near perfect ball tosses coupled with impeccable timing.

I’ve wasted tons of Poké Balls, Razz Berries, and patience trying to obtain the small amount of XP and Stardust for successful catches, and I’m starting to wonder if it’s worth throwing over 5 or 6 Poké Balls for each “easy” catch.",Players discover major change in Pokemon Go after hitting level 20

1 Pokemon in a gym for 21 hours gets you 500 stardust and 10 pokécoins. ,https://fraghero.com/heres-how-you-can-get-free-pokecoins-in-pokemon-go/,"Although Pokemon Go is a free app, there are options of spending real world money like most free to play mobile games. You can spend real life money to buy the game’s currency, PokeCoins, which can be spent on buying several items like Egg Incubators, Incense, Lucky Eggs and PokeBalls.

Using PokeCoins in Pokemon Go could really accelerate your progress in the game, but it comes at a price, unless you are smart and use this method.

However, there is a simple way to save your hard earned money and get PokeCoins for free. All you need is to be above level 5 and have one of your Pokemon assigned to a gym.

First, you’ll need to raise the prestige level at a friendly gym if there currently isn’t room to add your Pokemon to it.

Secondly, you’ll need to defeat an enemy gym if it isn’t currently owned by your team.

When you totally defeat an enemy gym, you can leave one of your Pokemon in that gym to defend it. While your Pokemon defends a gym controlled by your team, you earn free daily PokeCoins for however many gyms your Pokemon are defending. You will keep earning PokeCoins without spending any money until the gym is under your team’s control.

In order to claim the rewarded PokeCoins, go to the top right corner of your ‘shop’ screen where you’ll find a shield. The number that appears on the shield is the number of gym you have Pokemon defending. Just tap on it and claim your PokeCoins. You will receive 10 PokeCoins for each gym you are defending at the time.

Remember, this process can only be done once every 20 hours or so. It is also wise to keep as many Pokemon defending the gyms as possible to earn more coins, so gather up some teammates and raise the gym’s level to make it even stronger.

You can't yet. ,http://comicbook.com/2016/07/17/how-to-get-legendary-pokemon-in-pokemon-go/,"Last week, ComicBook.com gave Pokemon Go players their first glimpse of the Legendary Bird trio and Mewtwo, via a datamine that revealed their Pokedex pictures. Yesterday, a Redditor posted code data from Pokemon Go on the subreddit /r/pokemongodev that revealed some new information about the Legendary Pokemon Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres and Mewtwo.

So how do you catch Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Go? Here's what we know. Based on the information, the four will not appear in the wild. All of their data is missing a ""Base Capture Rate"", which indicates that they can't be caught in the wild. That's a pretty good indicator that all four Pokemon (plus Mew) are being reserved for special events or prizes of some kind.

So if you can't catch Mewtwo and the other Legendary Pokemon in the wild, how do you get them? Well, the popular theory is that they're being saved for ""raids"", a timed event in which players team up to take down a particularly strong Pokemon. We saw a glimpse of that in the first trailer for Pokemon Go, but Niantic has been tight-lipped on the subject since.

Some players are also speculating that the Legendaries could be reserved as some sort of reward for holding a gym or being a top ranked player on your team. Of course, Pokemon Go doesn't currently have a ranking system or way to track how long you've held a gym, so those theories seem more like fanciful speculation than hard fact.

What we do know is that Niantic Labs is hosting a Pokemon Go panel at SDCC next week. With a worldwide rollout underway, it's certainly possible we'll get more details on how and when the Legendary Pokemon will be revealed.",How to Get Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Go

"Like most plug and play systems, you can't add more games.",http://www.techinsider.io/heres-the-biggest-limitation-of-the-nes-classic-edition-2016-7,"When the news broke earlier this week that Nintendo would be releasing a new, smaller version of its first major game console, the internet was abuzz with nostalgic excitement. The NES Classic Edition will come with 30 of the console's greatest games and it fits right in the palm of your hand for $60 this November.

One question that came up after the announcement was whether or not Nintendo will ever release additional classic games for the system. According to an exchange with Kotaku, the answer is a definitive no.

Sorry folks, but that cartridge slot doesn't open. Nintendo

The cartridge slot on the front of the unit doesn't actually open; it's just there for aesthetic appeal. An original Nintendo cartridge would be far too big to fit in there anyway, of course. But still, some thought it might be able to connect to the internet and download additional games, or receive new games via some other kind of physical media.

""The console is a standalone device, so it cannot connect to the internet or any external storage devices,"" Nintendo told Kotaku. ""The game lineup was chosen to provide a diverse mix of popular and recognizable NES games that appeal to a wide variety of players. Everyone should be able to find multiple games to enjoy.""

The NES Classic Edition doesn't support downloadable or physical add-ons because it isn't meant for video game enthusiasts. Nintendo is tapping into a market of older fans who might see the console, fondly remember games like ""Super Mario Bros."" and ""The Legend of Zelda"" and decide to pick it up to relive their childhoods or play the games with their kids.

It's meant to be a hassle-free nostalgia trip, meaning hardcore gamers who expect features like downloadable content should probably steer clear unless they want it as a collector's item. Other classic game companies like Atari have released similar devices in the past for the casual crowd, and judging by the internet's reaction to the NES Classic Edition, Nintendo's is going to be in pretty high demand this holiday season.",Here's the biggest limitation of Nintendo's new $60 console
Nearby Pokemon indicator. Nobody is sure what distance each paw print represents. ,https://fraghero.com/pokemon-go-has-a-feature-that-nobody-knows-how-to-use/,"So, for those who have been living somewhere under a rock in the middle of the Carribean sea, Pokemon Go came out last week and lots of people are playing it. It’s been a huge hit, and people all over the world are currently enjoying catching Pokemon out in the real world.

The game isn’t overly complex, but then again, neither are its functions explained in great detail. One function in particular has been niggling at players, causing quite a great deal of annoyance. Problem is, it’s one of the games most used features to boot.

The “Nearby” function is theoretically supposed to show you the variety of Pokemon in the area that you’re in, and your distance from each of them. Unless previously caught, only the silhouette of the Pokemon is shown (usually easily guessable however). The distance is represented by pawprints – the greater the number, the further away the Pokemon is.

Now, you would think this feature would typically be one of, if the not the most, used while playing the game. The main point of being a Pokemon trainer is to “catch ‘em all”, after all. However, the feature developer Niantic have currently supplied players with is pretty……well, shit.

There’s no accurate distance to be figured out of from the pawprints. Some people claim that a single pawprint indicates around 50 metres. Then again, the go-to Pokemon factoid site Serebii says that one pawprint actually indicates 20 metres . In that case, two pawprints is 40 metres, and three represent 60 metres? No. According to Serebii, two pawprints are 100 metres, and three means 1000 metres, or 1 kilometre.

Right. Totally logical.

Even being on right on top of a Pokemon (no pawprints) induces a frantic, random search that involves far more work than it should do. If my phone tells me a Pikachu is so close to me I could smell it Poke-fart, I shouldn’t have to spend 20 minutes climbing on top of bins and scrambling under cars for it to grace me with its presence.

Some people think they have a formula nailed down. Redditor TheColourlessPill came up with a formula (shown in the photo below, kindly done by Redditor DJ Toaster) that they think helps narrow down catching those wily Poke-buggers. It’s quite convoluted, and does require at least University level Geography skills, but for now, it might be the best way we have to track down the more elusive targets on our list.

Now, the game has just released, and with its wild popularity, Niantic probably have their hands full just keeping the servers working (especially with people constantly fluking the GPS system to appear in place they’re not ). They’ve undoubtedly received a lot of feedback that will be getting sifted through now right now in order to improve the game and make it more enjoyable for everyone playing.

My own suggestion would be to add a simple, accurate distance to those pawprints. A directional indicator would be handy – maybe an item on the store could be introduced to show the direction of Pokemon from your location, in tandem with the “Nearby” indicator. Niantic may not want to do that, as it could reduce the challenge of the game significantly.

At the very minimum however, if we could just figure out how far away we are from something, we can much more easily search for it. This would help reduce the marathon inducing hunting parties down to merely being annoyed while finding a Pokemon hiding nearby.

That’s my suggestion, for what it’s worth. As to what Niantic decide to actually do, we’ll probably find out soon enough. They plan to introduce a bi-weekly update schedule, so give it another couple weeks, and we’ll see what kind of tweaks and fixes they’ll have in store.",Pokémon Go Has A Feature That Nobody Knows How To Use
Poke stops and empty gyms. ,https://fraghero.com/we-went-to-area-51-to-play-pokemon-go-and-you-wont-believe-what-we-found/,"With the launch of Pokemon Go, the world was curious to know if any Pokemon were to be found at the infamous Extraterrestrial Highway Area 51, and if so, would there be any Pokestops or Gyms?

Area 51 is one of the most secret and heavily guarded military bases on the planet and home to much alien folklore. The curiosity reached a boiling point, and people demanded answers. Will we find Free Pokemon Cheats and Coins?

Situated in the southern portion of Nevada, the base has long been considered one of the most mysterious U.S. Armed Forces establishments, with rumors suggesting it’s used to store alien lifeforms and build high-tech weaponry to fend off alien attacks. This all depends on the size of your tin foil hat, of course.

The Extraterrestrial Highway is State Route 375 (SR 375) located in south-central Nevada in the United States.

The area did indeed feature Pokemon team hunting grounds and also several gyms and Pokestops. We even found a Pokemon right at the back gate of the military base and several rare Pokemon features in the immediate surrounding area.

We were shocked to find empty gyms. There were two completely empty gyms right outside the back gate of the base in the very small town of Rachel, NV. This town has been featured in movies such as Paul, Independence Day, and many others.

At the time of this writing, Fraghero controls 8 pokemon gyms along the extraterrestrial highway leading up to Area 51 itself. We caught several types of Area 51 Pokemon

Warning: Don’t try to do this, we were extremely careful and didn’t break any rules, not to mention our reporter is an ex-military veteran. We won’t be responsible if you end up being detained or worse.

Here’s what we found along the Extraterrestrial Highway, and all the way to the Back Gate of Area 51:

At the corner before you turn on to the highway there is an Alien Jerky Shop with multiple Pokestops

The sign marking the start of the highway. There is also a gym and a Pokestop located here!

We found this guy at this abandoned gas station:

Just chilling in the middle of nowhere:

You will see all kinds of weird stuff on the highway, and almost each one has a Pokestop:

Once you get close to the main gate of the base, they block all mobile signal, but there was a bit of signal at the back gate, which we’ll cover below.

The road to the main gate of Area 51:

We out here



Located right by the Main gate road:

After the main base gate road, if you drive a few more miles down the road you get to the town of Rachel, NV. This town is home to the world famous Little A’Le’Inn, which has been featured in many movies (Paul, Independence Day, etc.)

Located there were 3 gyms, and 5 Pokestops. To our shock and surprise, the gyms were completely empty.

Little A’Le’Inn you stole our hearts. We stole your gyms.

More empty gyms!

Located around the town are several Pokestops and Pokemon:

Located right by the town of Rachel is back gate road. This road leads to the back gate of Area 51. We were able to have mobile signal for the entire drive all the way up to the actual gate.

Here’s a photo of the south gate: (We would post our own, but it’s illegal to photograph this area):

Here’s a screenshot of our Pokemon Go app at the Back Gate of Area 51: (There’s Pokemon!)

And again at night:

On the drive home, we found a Pikachu nearby, at almost every power plant/station (Pikachus store energy in their red cheeks):

We also found Charmanders at large truck stops/gas stations in the “Diesel” section.

Area 51 definitely has a lot to offer for Pokemon Go Tricks players, but it would be stupid to venture out there without doing some extensive research prior to making a trip. However, someone needed to go there and get answers for the millions of Pokemon players out there with this Pokemon Guide, and Fraghero was happy to volunteer for the arduous task.

Women are not worse at games than men. When tested they are just as fast at levelling up. ,http://www.iflscience.com/technology/debunking-one-of-the-biggest-stereotypes-about-women-in-the-gaming-community/,"When girl gamers do well, men will often find ways to discredit the success. 'Gamer' via www.shutterstock.com

Although women now make up almost half of all video game players, the gaming community remains, in some ways, hostile toward women.

For example, the GamerGate controversy, which began in 2014 and involved a harassment campaign against prominent female gamers, journalists and designers, reflected a longstanding undercurrent of misogyny and sexism in the community. In some cases, those who challenged the sexism found themselves threatened with rape or death.

There’s also the long-held stereotype that men are simply better gamers than women. Women gamers are often perceived as incompetent players who aren’t genuinely interested in the games but rather sign up to get attention. If a female gamer does play well, she’s often derided as a hacker – someone who cheats to gain an advantage – because “there is no way a girl can be that good.”

In a recent study, we set out to examine whether men really make better gamers than women and, if so, what drove the gender performance gap. Specifically, we wanted to compare how quickly men and women leveled up in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, which are online worlds where thousands of players develop characters, make friends, join groups, complete quests and slay dragons together.

If men are actually better gamers than women, they should advance to higher levels within the same amount of play time. But if they don’t progress any faster, this finding would help refute one of the most pervasive stereotypes that continue to exist in the gaming community.

Getting to the next level

Our research used anonymous server data from over 10,000 men and women in two MMOs, “EverQuest II” in the United States and “Chevaliers' Romance III” in China. We knew each player’s actual gender through their account registration information.",Debunking One Of The Biggest Stereotypes About Women In The Gaming Community
Ana - a healing sniper. ,https://fraghero.com/new-overwatch-hero-announced-and-its-not-who-you-expected/,"Overwatch fans will be excited to hear that a new hero has just been announced to join the roster and help in the fight for saving the world. For a while now, fans have theorised that the new hero will be called Sombra, but any information further than that has laid out of their grasp.

Well, this new hero isn’t Sombra. Sorry to those who thought it would be. However, don’t be disheartened, as you’re in for a lot of fun. This new hero’s name? Ana. Ana, the kickass heal-sniper.

Ana’s inclusion adds a truly unique set of skills for players to get their hands on. Now, you can hang back away from the heat of the action, but still lend support to those in its midst. You can heal, you can put your enemies to sleep, and also lend traditional fire support as you would as a normal sniper.

Check out the gameplay trailer below for peek at what kind of awesomeness you can expect.

Much like other heroes, Ana comes with a distinct back story to flesh out her character, and it’s a goodie. Turns out she is Pharah’s mother, and was part of a group very similar (if not just an earlier incarnation of) the Overwatch team.

Ana taught Pharah all she knows, which explains why she grew up to be such a badass. She states in her origin video that she didn’t want the same life for Pharah as she’d had, although I’d imagine growing up around a group of heroes would kind of set you on that path regardless.

Ana’s inclusion in the game is a big one, both gameplay and story wise. Looking to the future, it’ll be interesting to see how Ana affects the game’s balance, and just who, or what, else Blizzard has up their sleeve. Maybe Sombra will make an appearance in a future release? Maybe Sombra was just a complete ruse? Only time will tell.",New Overwatch Hero Announced And It’s Not Who You Expected
It looks like it gives full access to your entire google account (more info in comments). ,http://www.thefederalistpapers.org/us/people-are-deleting-pokemon-go-asap-after-finding-out-disturbing-fact,"A new Pokemon phone game was released and has taken over social media in the last few days, a sequel of sorts to a video game that was popular in the 1990s.

The new game is called Pokemon Go. The basic concept of the game is walking around capturing Pokemon.

However, the app’s users are unknowingly compromising all their personal information (including pictures) in their Google account. This includes information from prior to the time the app was downloaded.

According to Popular Science:

While Pokémon GO users (there are millions and millions of them already) are collecting all 150 of the game’s fictional species of creatures, Niantic and Nintendo are gaining access to and collecting a lot of your personal information. It’s not just the ability to track your location, or the fact that the app is linked with your Google account that’s worrisome; most users accepted a level of invasive monitoring willingly, given the game is about GPS-based hunting. But the app gives away way more than that to the company. Way more. Anyone who signed up for Pokémon GO with a Google account (the other option, a Pokémon.com account, is unavailable right now) has perhaps unknowingly given Nintendo and developer Niantic (formerly owned by Google, but still part of Google’s investment portfolio) full account access. That means they can see/edit/collect just about anything related to your Google account. Emails, photos, documents, all of your past location and search history: it can see all of this stuff, from even before you started using the app. It can also send emails as you—kind of the number one, red flag, alarm bell hacker opportunity in the digital world, aside from banking.

Apparently users have decided that their privacy isn’t worth the pleasure of chasing Pokemon around their neighborhood. Good choice, America.

Darwin Police Station has warned the players of Pokemon GO to not trespass.

The much awaited mobile phone game, which released this week has received a warm response from the fans. Pokemon GO uses the camera and the GPS of the smartphone to track down real world Pokemon, but the players must make sure that they keep away from visiting some places while catching them.

The media team of the Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services Organization has already already made a made a Facebook post regarding this. The post advises the Pokemon GO players to not enter the Darwin Police Station while collecting Pokeballs.

The post reads, “For those budding Pokemon Trainers out there using Pokemon Go – whilst the Darwin Police Station may feature as a Pokestop, please be advised that you don’t actually have to step inside in order to gain the pokeballs,” the post reads. “It’s also a good idea to look up, away from your phone and both ways before crossing the street.

Battery consumption. ,https://fraghero.com/pokemon-go-players-have-already-found-a-major-issue-with-the-game/,"Image: The Pokemon Company

The much anticipated mobile game Pokémon GO has already released in Australia and New Zealand. The game is definitely a good one to play, but one thing that has troubled the players is its battery consumption.

The game has been accused of draining a whole lot of phone battery. The main reason of the game’s enormous battery consumption, according to CyberShack, is its use of GPS and the rear facing camera.

Developer Niantic, however, stated in the game’s official page that the battery issue is known to them. They wrote:

Heavy battery use Some devices may experience battery drain while playing Pokémon GOfor prolonged periods of time. We are working on a solution.

Some tips to conserve the battery life while using the game is by adjusting screen brightness, reducing in-game actions, and turning off the sound. This has also been mentioned in the Pokémon Go Database. A battery saver option is also available in the game’s settings, but players say that it doesn’t make a noticeable difference.

Here are some tweets from players about the battery life of the game:

Exit save.

For most people, we always save before we exit the game. The use for this feature becomes immediately apparant when you consider Survival Mode however.

You see, before this update, Survival Mode players had to physically walk (no fast travel) to a location that had a bed in order to save. It was extremely inconvenient from a practical sense.

Now with update 1.6, Fallout 4 will create an auto-save upon exiting to the main menu. The save is then deleted once reloading it, in order to prevent people from abusing it in Survival Mode.

It makes it so you still can’t revert back to it if you die, meaning when you reload, you best be on your way to a bed in order to create a perma-save. The change comes as a perfect compromise.

Catch the pigeon. ,https://fraghero.com/battlefield-1-might-have-a-hilarious-new-game-mode-that-sounds-crazy/,"Image: www.battlefield.com

Battlefield 1 has been one of the most hyped games this year and there has been a lot of rumors and leaks about it since its reveal. Recently, a lot of details about the game including maps, modes, weapons and more were leaked. The list of the details were compiled by Reddit user Lobix300.

Just after two days of the massive leak, another rumor involving Battlefield 1 has been been doing rounds. Although, it sounds a bit weird, we are forced to believe that the game might have a ‘capture the pigeon’ mode.

You might definitely be wondering why this rumor is trustworthy or what has capturing pigeons to do with Battlefield 1. We have to partially trust this rumor because it was leaked by YouTube user AlmightyDaq who also posted a video back in March revealing a lot of details about the next Battlefield game which were proved to be true.

AlmightyDaq even explained about the ‘Pigeon game mode’, “There’s also a pigeon game mode. That is to say it’s similar to Capture the Flag in a way. [The] Pigeon functions like a flag that must be held for a certain amount of time before [it] flies away towards the base carrying a message, thus scoring your team a point,” he explains. “It’s pretty ridiculous sounding, but take my word for it.”

Even though it sounds crazy, it is definitely not impossible. However, we’ll have to wait for some time to get this rumor confirmed. Would you love to secure a pigeon in Battlefield 1 for the longest time and score points? We sure would!

The new Play Anywhere feature of Xbox One will be live starting September 13. The release date of the feature, which was announced during last month’s E3 conference, was confirmed by Microsoft to Polygon.

The Play Anywhere feature will allow players to get a PC version of a game for free if they buy its digital copy on Xbox One, and vice versa. The feature also lets the players save their game and achievements across both devices.

However, the upcoming feature will need the Windows 10 Anniversary update which will roll out on August 2. It’s another summer update, which will come out soon, and will also be required for Xbox One users.

ReCore will be the first game to support the Play Anywhere feature, which will release on September 13 alongside the feature itself. Some of the other upcoming games which will support these features are Gears of War 4, Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 3, Scalebound, State of Decay 2, and Halo Wars 2.

Sony, on the other hand said that they had no plans right now to introduce similar kind of features to unite PlayStation 4 and PC.

Andrew House, President of PlayStation said, “I always hesitate to be drawn into discussions of someone else’s strategy. I’m more than happy to talk about our own strategy.

There is bad news for Skyrim players who played the game on Xbox 360 or PS3, as opposed to current gen consoles. The game which is expected to release very soon has really made role playing game fans have something to look forward to this year.

The version promises improved visuals and full 4K support. What’s more Bethesda has also announced that the game will support mods on both the Xbox One and PS4 versions.

Although Xbox One users would be able to make mods using third-party assets, PS4 users won’t be able to use any third-party assets to create mods. This means you nude mods, etc on PS4.

However, this isn’t the bad news we’re talking about. Pete Hines, Bethesda’s Vice President confirmed something a bit more harrowing during one of his usual Twitter QnA sessions recently that might not go down too well with fans.

The upcoming remastered version of the bestselling Bethesda RPG which is titled as The Elder Scrolls Skyrim: Special Edition, will not support the older save files in present gen consoles.

Pete Hines, Vice President of Bethesda, confirmed while answering to fan’s question on Twitter that cross platform transfer of saved files will not be possible for the remastered version of the game.

One of the fans also inquired whether the saved files can be transferred from PC to Xbox One via the official Bethesda website, to which Hines replied with a straight ‘No’.



Although this news might be disappointing for players who have spent hundreds of hours playing Skyrim, we have to understand the fact that the current gen consoles (Xbox One and PlayStation 4) and the previous gen consoles (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3) have entirely different data structures which makes it impossible to transfer saved files.

They are working on GTA Online. It makes them more money. ,https://fraghero.com/this-is-the-reason-why-gta-v-hasnt-had-a-single-player-dlc-yet/,"Grand Theft Auto V has been out for a good few years now but Rockstar is yet to release any single-player DLC for it. This has many gamers thinking as to why there hasn’t been any DLC content released for the game although it was such a massive commercial and critical success.

We finally might have an answer to this question thanks to the recently concluded earnings conference call by Take-Two Interactive for Q3 2015.

According to Take-Two their net revenue for Q3 was $486.8 million as compared to $954 million in last year’s third quarter. The dip in earnings is mostly due to no notable releases from its stables during this time period while last year had quite a few of them.

However, that’s still a large amount of money and most of it is due to one title: Grand Theft Auto V. You might be wondering how that’s possible but it’s obvious.

This is due to Grand Theft Auto Online which is the standalone online component of the game. The online product seems to be raking in serious moolah for Take-Two and it’s no surprise that there’s been no single-player DLC pack release for GTA V.

Rockstar is busy adding more features to the online experience and releasing DLC for GTA Online regularly and has had no time to focus on GTA V’s single-player aspects.

Rockstar is fully committed to improving the experience for gamers and has been known to release several additions to improve the product.

This has prevented them from focusing on the single-player game and considering how successful GTA Online has proven to be, it is likely there won’t ever be a single-player DLC pack for GTA V.

Take-Two’s promised even more content for GTA Online in days to come which will further boost revenue. When there is money being made, who cares about keeping up old promises such as releasing an expansion pack for the single-player aspect of GTA V?

Take-Two clearly doesn’t but don’t write them off completely. We might have an announcement during E3 this year that might prove us wrong (we hope).",The real reason GTA V hasn’t got any single player DLC ever

Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg has spoken about the company’s reaction to the initial fan response to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, in an interview with Mashable.

The official reveal trailer of the game has garnered over more than 3 million dislikes on YouTube since it was uploaded on May 2nd.

In the interview with Mashable at E3, Eric Hirshberg confirmed that the company hasn’t changed anything in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare after the initial fan response, which was overwhelmingly negative, especially on YouTube.

He said, “We’re doing the same thing after the response as before, which is focusing on making a great game.” “At the end of the day, when we do that we tend to make fans happy and win people over and continue to have the franchise flourish,” he added.

Hirshberg also mentioned the fact that even Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 received negative responses initially but went on to become the best selling Call of Duty game ever. Black Ops 2 was also disregarded by fans before release because of the futuristic setting of the game.

“Our previous most-disliked trailer was the reveal trailer for Black Ops 2,” Hirshberg said. “[That was] the first time we brought the franchise into the future. And that turned out to be one of our most successful games ever.”

Hirshberg said, “The franchise has never been stronger than it is right now in terms of the number of people we have online playing. Black Ops 3 is doing great. We’ve managed to keep it relevant and fresh longer than many people thought we could.”

The CEO also stressed on the fact that the dislikes on YouTube didn’t affect the pre-order numbers of the game. Interestingly, he pointed out that the negative reactions were mostly restricted to YouTube, and the trailer for the game was mostly well received on other social media platforms, including Facebook.

He said, “We didn’t see that reaction on other platforms and in other metrics.We didn’t see it in our pre-order momentum, we didn’t see it even in the same exact [trailer posting] on other platforms, like Facebook.” “It was unique.”

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare managed to impress with its E3 presentation, where it showed off some amazing single-player gameplay footage. However, there’s been a total blackout as far as the game’s multiplayer is concerned, but the company’s expected to showcase it during its upcoming Call of Duty XP event in September.",Activision CEO sends out clear message when asked if Infinite Warfare changed after negative fan response

Many fans have speculated that GTA V would be the last installment due to the ambiguously named “GTA Online” – a name which implies that future installments, at least of a multiplayer variety, are not to be expected.

However, new information from a multitude of sources has been leaked about the next installment in Rockstar Games’ headlining series, including specifics about the game’s setting, plot, features and functionality. As with any pre-release information, this is subject to interpretation and change.

Though no release date has been confirmed, GTA 6 has been confirmed to release sometime in the future. The exact date will likely be two years ahead of the initial estimated release date set by Rockstar, to give them time to “polish” the final copy and deliver an experience fans are sure to enjoy, despite their discontent while waiting twenty-four months more than they should have.

More details have also leaked, read on to know how Rockstar Games plans to make GTA VI the best game the universe has ever seen. (No, really)

GTA 6 will feature a main character – or characters – that players will be forced to control if they wish to play the game. These lead characters will be voiced by an actor, or actors, who will have exponentially more witty dialogue and banter than any of the side characters or miscellaneous pedestrians because they’re just naturally more intelligent, funny, and bulletproof.

The graphics are rumored to be an improvement on those of GTA V, and the physics engine and AI functionality will also be improved to prevent drivers who accidentally run over player characters from reversing and running them over six more times.

Though unconfirmed, there are also reports that large vehicles capable of towing will also no longer take off like the Apollo 13 rocket when attached to a trailer and touched by anything more forceful than a hummingbird.

Much to the disappointment of many players, the game will not be released on PS1 or the Nintendo 64. This has led to uproar among fans who insist their older consoles are “just as good” as next-gen platforms and they shouldn’t lose out on content just because they don’t have access to their parents’ money or the motivation to get a job and buy a newer system.

Though a multiplayer aspect has been rumored, players will require an online connection in order to access it. The stability of the online mode has been put up for debate, however, as almost all online features will also require a connection to Rockstar’s servers which are known to go down faster and more frequently than a cheerleader on prom night.

Some of the game’s shops will have humorous names such as “All Of My Stock is Legal” or “Totally Legitimate Medicinal Marijuana Dispensary.” This has already incited anger among Liberal media and social justice activists for being offensive and an unfair representation of multiple minorities as well as the entirety of the country.

The game will feature a radio with multiple stations, many of which play various kinds of music. Some will also feature talk radio shows, which will undoubtedly annoy every side character, prostitute and ally who enters your vehicle to the point of suicide.

Despite fan conspiracy theories, the game is confirmed to be set on the planet Earth and will not feature laser guns, hybrid jetpacks, alien invasions, or any other galactic planetary entity as a playable area.

Finally, the game will feature mature content, such as receiving fully-clothed sexual acts from sentient plastic dolls, senselessly murdering obese Midwestern tourists for yelling obscenities at you, and partial nudity which will undoubtedly be repeatedly photographed and uploaded to Rockstar’s Social Club by twelve-year-old children obsessing over an animated nipple, or worse, a seventy-year-old altruist’s kibbles and bits.

In addition to these features, Rockstar is said to have multiple downloadable content bundles in the works, which will be free to download but contain items so ludicrously expensive in game currency that microtransactions will be necessary to own anything more than your grandmother’s Buick and an airsoft pistol.

You’ll be glad to know then that the company plans to release a free Ubisoft game each month, for the next seven months.

The offer is seemingly part of their 30th anniversary celebrations – good guy Ubisoft. In an official statement, they said the following:

"Allow you to stream Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo III, StarCraft II, and Overwatch via Facebook live. ",https://www.inverse.com/article/16592-facebook-will-soon-let-you-livestream-overwatch?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=inverse-ent&utm_campaign,"If you play video games – and even if you don’t – your Facebook feed has begun to drizzle with posts about the first-person shooter Overwatch. Those drizzles are about to turn into a flood.

This morning, Blizzard Entertainment announced that it will implement Facebook Live API, allowing players to log in to Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo III, StarCraft II, and the newest sensation Overwatch and live-stream sessions onto their timelines later this month via PC. No definite start date was announced, though.

The new features will allow friends to subscribe to other player’s timelines, notifying them when a new stream has begun. Presumably, as with Facebook’s current live streaming video functionality, friends and subscribers can comment and share while tuned in to the stream.

“Blizzard games are best when played with friends, so it’s important to us to provide our players with features and services that make it easy and fun to share their experiences with each other,” said Blizzard executive vice president of corporate operations Gio Hunt. “We’re working closely with Facebook on this integration for Overwatch, as well as our other games, and we look forward to sharing further details on our plans as development progresses.”

This new development was almost inevitable, given the popularity of Facebook video and game streaming on platforms like Twitch. Blizzard started streaming on Facebook this year with “Heroes of the Dorm,” the collegiate Heroes of the Storm tournament that aired on ESPN 2 last year. At the launch of Overwatch last week, which Elon Musk is a fan for whatever that’s worth, Blizzard live-streamed the event for its 3 million fans.

The unity between Facebook and Blizzard wasn’t overnight. To prep for Overwatch’s launch, Facebook and Blizzard worked on a “comprehensive mix” of marketing solutions using Facebook’s targeting capabilities. This helped expose Overwatch to 1.65 billion people, which explains why everyone is obsessed about it and you’re a loser if you’re not playing it.

France and Russia. ,https://fraghero.com/battlefield-1-multiplayer-factions-wont-include-these-two-major-countries-at-launch/,"Battlefield’s Twitter account confirmed the multiplayer factions of Battlefield 1 yesterday.

They replied with the names of the following countries when fans asked which nations will be included in the multiplayer version of the game. It looks like you can play as the following: British, German, Austro-Hungarian, Italian, Ottoman, and American.

It was confirmed that France and Russia, who played major roles in World War 1, will not feature in the game, at least in the launch build of the game. This has left the fans wondering why these two nations were omitted at launch.

This comes as quite a surprising decision on DICE’s part, considering both France and Russia played an important role in World War 1 and lost more than a million soldiers each who served on the frontlines.

However, it was revealed later that the French will be included in the multiplayer through a DLC pack. Julien Wera of DICE, in an interview with Lemonde, said that they acknowledged the importance of France’s contribution to World War 1, and hence decided to include French troops as a dedicated DLC post launch. Wera didn’t mention whether the DLC will be a paid or a free one.

Earlier to this, people were also critical of EA’s decision to not include female soldiers in the multiplayer version of the game.",Battlefield 1 multiplayer factions won’t include these two major countries at launch
Jump. ,http://time.com/4365659/zelda-breath-of-the-wild/,"After three decades of acrobatically restrained Zelda games, Nintendo is about to upend a sacred franchise tenet: Link, the series’ elf-eared, avocado-trousered protagonist, can finally jump. Not the little leap he’ll perform automatically in older installments when you run him off a ledge, but a button-specific, bona fide vault.

There’s a justifiable game-changing reason for this, and it involves serious hang-time in what Nintendo’s dubbed The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. That’s the official name for the next-in-series fantasy roamer, due simultaneously on the company’s Wii U and forthcoming new game platform (still known solely as “NX”) next March. I’ll explain the game’s title in a moment.

But first let’s talk about climbing. Serious climbing. Rock climbing. Tree climbing. Whatever-you-can-touch-climbing. Approach any perpendicular surface, tap the jump button, and up Link goes. Ruins. Vertiginous towers. Cliff walls. Tree trunks. Escarpments you’d slide down in any other game or need a grappling hook to summit. Altaïr, Spiderman and this guy have nothing on the newfangled version of Nintendo’s iconic sword-spinner. It’s all part of the creative team’s attempt to craft an open-ended world for players to tramp through any way they like in another first for the series.

Or maybe a second, if we’re counting Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka’s 1986 Nintendo Entertainment System free-wandering original. As in that game, you can venture into Breath of the Wild‘s more than 100 dungeons (called “shrines”) in whatever order you like. Just don’t expect the enemies lying in wait to be homogenous pushovers. That’s part of how Nintendo’s regulating progression through the game this time: With great freedom comes the likelihood that you’ll wander into a growling goblin’s nest.

Nintendo

On the other hand, Nintendo says it hopes you’ll do just that, which is where the subtitle “Breath of the Wild” comes in. At a pre-E3 event, the game’s producer Eiji Aonuma explained that instead of coming up with a title based on a central story item (ocarinas, swords, caps, hourglasses) or character (Link, Majora, the eponymous twilight princess), the team wanted it to emblematize the world itself. So “wild” in the sense that Nintendo wants experimentation and surprise by way of the open, unexplored world design to be “the soul of the experience.”

That carries through the game’s visual style, inspired by a form of water color art called gouache, said Nintendo. It’s further informed by an approach to painting known as en plein air, or “open air,” where the artist attempts to replicate the moment of an experience (to give that a bit of context, impressionists like Monet and Renoir were proponents of the approach). In practice, it’s something like a hybridization of the look in the last few games, as if The Wind Waker‘s cel-shading were merged with Twilight Princess‘s quasi-realistic style.

The world, which I was able to dash and scramble around for roughly 30 minutes, feels as grand as teased in earlier sneak peeks, and the team says wherever you can see you can go “and beyond.” In the demo, we were allowed to explore a partly forested area Nintendo said represented just 1% of the total explorable world. Zoom the map out, and that world becomes a sprawl of regions grouped into valleys, jungles, mountains and—Treehouse’s Bill Trinen teased this last—possibly even the ocean. All told, Nintendo says Breath of the Wild is 12 times the size of Twilight Princess (itself no slouch in the epic fantasy world Olympics).

Jumping and free-roaming are just the start of the game’s rethinking of cherished Zelda tropes. Instead of cutting grass to conjure life-replenishing hearts, you hunt for or harvest ingredients consumable raw for minor performance boosts. Combine these in a cooking pan, by contrast, and you can craft edibles with perks in what looks to be an elaborate recipe chasing mini-game.

The weather plays a role now, too. Sudden downpours can douse fires, and brandishing a metallic object during a lightning storm may have the sort of jolting repercussions you’d imagine. There’s even a temperature gauge you’ll need to keep tabs on, donning warmer clothes to survive colder environments and vice versa.

Nintendo

Link’s arsenal of axes, clubs and long blades are more transient and break easily, and part of maintaining your arsenal involves stealing new ones from enemies. Enemies no longer roam at random, but occupy colonies and encampments, and they’re meant to have a sense of situational purposefulness, says Nintendo. Wait until nighttime (1 minute of realtime = 1 hour of game time) and they’ll sleep, making them easier to sneak up on, and sneaking’s also a thing: Move quickly and an audio meter bounces erratically to indicate your conspicuousness; crouch, and the meter flattens to let you know you’ve become sonically invisible.

A new and apparently intricate physics framework empowers distinctive tactics. Chop down a hillside tree (yes, Link can chop down trees) and it’ll topple, then roll downhill, clearing whatever’s in its path (or, if near a crevasse, become a bridge you can clamber across). The same for boulders, which you can shove down inclines to flatten foes. The series’ spherical bombs now come in multiple flavors, including one you can ply the environment to roll or push around like a pinball. Hop on Link’s shield and he’ll surf, Legolas-like, down mountainsides. And there’s a paraglider with which Link can soar high above areas, taking in the view to spy hidden items or suss alternate approach paths.

What’s to stop players from immediately ranging across half the map with impunity? Climb or fly without pause and a circular stamina meter gradually dwindles until Link plummets. I take that to mean there’ll be plenty of climbing and flying puzzles, where you’ll have to plot approach paths by locating and folding respite points into lengthy climbs or glides. (That, or come up with recipes for stamina-bolstering victuals.)

As promised, you can use the Wolf Link amiibo to import that character as a companion who’ll stay with Link until defeated (at which point you have to wait 24 hours of real world time to re-import him). Level up Wolf Link’s health playing Twilight Princess, and he’ll have the same number of hearts playing at Link’s side in Breath of the Wild; import him cold, and he’ll be stuck with just three (a clear prod to Wii U fans who’ve yet to buy that game bundle). Nintendo’s also making two new amiibo, one of Link holding a bow (Archer Link) and another of him on horseback (Rider Link), but the team wasn’t ready to say how they’ll function in the game.

Nintendo

It’s not clear what Link’s up to or who he’s ultimately squaring off with in the Zelda-verse this time, but Aonuma confirmed this version of Link has been snoozing for 100 years (he wakes and rises from a tomb-like bed at the game’s start). And when someone asked where this Zelda slots in the lore, Aonuma pointed to the t-shirt he came wearing, inscribed with a variation on the Sheikah eye symbol that’s appeared in Zelda games since Ocarina of Time. Make of that what you will, said Aonuma with a sly smile.

Towards the end of my demo, in the belly of a rune-scrawled shrine, I got my hands on one of the game’s most intriguing new items: A magnet that lets you seize and then wing large objects around. All I managed to do before the demo ended was to yank a panel off the floor (unearthing a passage) and levitate a large block (to clear my route, but it also looked like I might be able to lob it at enemies). But my sense was that it’ll be a central part of this philosophical shift to a “single puzzle, multiple solutions” motif.

Important questions remain, the most obvious being how players are going to be able to have the same experience on the Wii U and NX versions—a point confirmed by Aonuma during the presentation—if the NX is truly something “unique and different.” We’ll know soon enough, when the company unveils the Wii U’s successor later this year.

It's still a long way off. They're jokingly saying that it will be published on 22/22/22. ,https://fraghero.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-confirmed-by-bethesda-but-its-a-long-way-off/,"There were a lot of big announcements and reveals in Bethesda’s E3 2016 press conference.

It also announced a brand new Quake game during the press conference.

Despite all this, one thing that the fans missed during the press conference was the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6.

Most of the fans expected the game to be announced during the event owing to the fact that Skyrim protagonist Dragonborn’s image was featured in Bethesda’s E3 promo images.

However, even though the game was not announced during the event, Bethesda boss Todd Howard confirmed that the game is in works in his own special way.

Speaking to Geoff Keighley during a “Youtube Live at E3” interview, Howard let the cat out of the bag:

It’s good in these moments to tell our fans, ‘Yes, of course we are [making The Elder Scrolls 6]. It’s something we love.’ But it is–you know, I have to be careful what I say–it’s a very long way off.” He added, “I could sit here and explain the game to you, and you would say, ‘That sounds like you don’t even have the technology–how long is that going to take?”

Howard also said they are working on two more projects which will be revealed before The Elder Scrolls 6, which means the latter won’t be coming anytime soon.

Vice President of PR and Marketing at Bethesda, Pete Hines, tweeted that he jokes with Todd Howard The Elder Scrolls 6 will release on 22/22/22. He also added that “our robot overlords will change our calendar system by the time it comes out.”

Although this is not a good news for the fans of the franchise, they’ll still have some other Elder Scrolls content to indulge in. Bethesda announced that there is going to be a big update in The Elder Scrolls Online and The Elder Scrolls: Legends will be releasing in PC and mobile.

Their core audience are males according to a former coder's Twitter. ,https://fraghero.com/battlefield-1-wont-have-female-soldiers-in-multiplayer-because-of-this-outrageous-reason/,"With Battlefield 1 producing groundbreaking features and currently living up to its hype, there is still one thing that each Battlefield game has been lacking: female soldiers in multiplayer. And it doesn’t look like EA’s next installment will entertain that idea, either.

With popular shooters such as Call of Duty and Overwatch including female characters in their multiplayer formats, it’s become quite the norm to play as a woman with guns blazing. However, the Battlefield franchise has never provided this feature, and Battlefield 1 will be no different. (Note that this is regards to online multiplayer only, because there is a playable female character in the story mode.)

What’s really entertaining is the reason behind this decision. Originally, females were going to be integrated as playable multiplayer characters, but then the idea was scrapped due to boys not finding it believable. Former DICE coder, Amanda Coget, took to Twitter in order to discuss how the conversation went down.

Even though female soldiers in WWI was not a common thing, it happened. And even though Battlefield is more realistic with its play style in comparison to other shooters, it’s still a video game.

There is a ton of room for interpretation when it comes to developing battles and fighting because despite how realistic a game is, it’s still pretty fictional. (I mean come on, respawning multiple times in a match is realistic, but playing as a female soldier isn’t?)

I’ve never classified myself as a feminist by any means, but this is ridiculous. It’s not upsetting that Battlefield 1 won’t have female soldiers (in multiplayer), but it’s highly offensive that they are catering to boys that wouldn’t find the idea believable. The concept is understandable, but the reasoning is not.

This isn’t the first time the game attempted to accommodate to the less informed consumer. EA originally ditched the idea of a World War I setting because they were concerned that kids didn’t know that it actually happened.

UPDATE 6/15/16: I just want to clear the air regarding the reasoning behind this article. It is not to start a debate about social equality, women’s rights, or anything of that nature. I don’t care if I have to play a game as a man, woman, alien, worm, or even a piece of chewed up bubble gum; I just like to play video games, regardless of the characters available. This article was written to simply state that it appeared that Battlefield 1 initially wanted to include women in their multiplayer for the first time, but ditched the idea later in order to appease their supposed target audience, which happens to be younger boys.",Battlefield 1 Won’t Have Female Soldiers in Multiplayer Because Of This Outrageous Reason
Perma-ban ,https://fraghero.com/bad-news-for-the-division-cheaters-as-ubisoft-finally-announces-harsh-punishment-for-offenders/,"The team that made The Division have had enough and decided that it’s one strike and you’re out. From an announcement made on the official Division website , the team stated that even first time offenders would be perma-banned if caught cheating in the game.

The announcement starts by acknowledging the effect cheating has had on the gamer base:

“Cheating has been a source of frustration for our community as some individuals have been gaining an unfair advantage in the game by using third-party software at the expense of our loyal players”

The rest of the announcement delves a little further into how exactly this cheating has been occurring, information coming from a podcast they released earlier on the matter. They state:

“While some of the game decisions are made client-side, there are constant server checks in place. This ensures that even in the situation where a player would be able to modify his client data, the servers can detect it.”

It’s from the client-server disparities that allow the cheaters to cheat. As good as the server checks are, things can still slip past. When The Division was initially released, lots of things could circumvent the server checks and gamers were free to abuse these as they saw fit.

Now though, the checks are much more in-depth and secure, and it’s becoming harder and harder for players to cheat in the game without getting noticed. With this new, iron-fist approach to even first time offenders, cheating could very soon become a thing of the past entirely.

This is all well and good. However, due to the extreme amount of negative responses The Division has accumulated since release, there may not be much of a player base to cheat soon anyways. The game is haemorrhaging players on PC, according to data provided by Steam itself. The peak number of gamers playing at one time in June so far is a little over 16,000. Compare that back closer to when the game launched in March, and a peak of 114,000 players can be seen.

That is a phenomenal loss of players in that space of time. Three months and 100,000 players lave the game? Ouch. If that kind of trend continues, no one will be playing The Division at all come the end of the year.

So, it’s a good thing that The Division is becoming more regulated and less cheatable, but it might be too little too late to save it from its possibly inevitable doom. It’s very possible that the game might see a resurgence in popularity, but usually once a game has lost steam, there’s little else you can do but stoke the fire and pray for the best.

Time will tell what lies in store for the future of The Division, and what kind of legacy its tumultuous release will leave on the industry.",Bad news for The Division cheaters as Ubisoft finally announce harsh punishment for offenders

Micro Transactions and map packs. ,https://fraghero.com/ea-just-confirmed-two-of-the-most-hated-features-for-battlefield-1/,"Battlefield 1’s official trailer has been getting rave reviews both from the gaming community and industry experts in general. Not only have the reveal trailer become the most viewed trailer on Youtube, but it also crushed its competitor Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare’s trailer, both in terms of reception and amount of views.

However, one should not forget that the Battlefield franchise is being published by EA, who isn’t really a fan-favorite either. And now, the company has sneakily confirmed that both micro-transactions and map packs would be part of Battlefield 1.

This information was revealed by EA’s CEO Andrew Wilson during a investor call last week. Although Wilson used some rather generous marketing speak to confirm the same, it doesn’t help taking away from the fact that most gamers despise this model.

Also read: Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare trailer is now the second most hated video on Youtube

Wilson first said how EA plans to make big bucks by cleverly utilizing ‘extra monetization opportunities’ without making the game feel like a ‘pay-to-win’ model:

As relates to Battlefield 1 and extra monetization opportunity,” CEO Andrew Wilson says, “taking a step back, any time we think about extra monetization inside an experience, we really think about it on two vectors: One, are we able to provide value to the gamer, in terms of extending and enhancing their experience? And two, are we able to do that in a world where we give them choice? We never want to be in a place where there’s a belief that we are providing a pay to win mechanic inside of one of our games.

He then went on to say how the company is looking poised to utilize both macro transactions and micro transactions in Battlefield 1 to offer a more ‘enhanced’ experience to players. Basically, fancy words for map packs (macro) and in-game items unlocked by paying real cash (micro).

Given that in Battlefield 1, you will see both macro monetization opportunities from us like maps and large scale content, as well as micro monetization opportunities, smaller increments of gameplay, and then over time, what you will see from us is elements of gameplay that allow gamers to engage and drive, and extend and enhance their experience, much the way people do with FIFA Ultimate Team or Madden Ultimate Team today. We feel very confident in our ability to deliver that in a way that is deemed valuable by our player, and drives increased engagement over time with them.

It’s a given that there’s big money to be made via in-game transactions these days and EA’s own sports games make a fortune by implementing them. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 has taken it to the extremes via its paid supply drops model. Heck, GTA Online’s made over $500 million via micro transactions alone.

Therefore, this shouldn’t surprise anyone but still it makes one wonder how serious the developers are about shipping a full game at launch these days compared to releasing it in bits and pieces to boost revenue.",These Two Hated Features are part of Battlefield 1

It was also discussed earlier that the Batman game will feature some familiar characters like Vicki Vale, Jim Gordon, Alfred Pennyworth and Renee Montoya.

All Points Bulletin has made its console debut yesterday after being quietly launched on Xbox One. The new game, APB: Reloaded is inspired by GTA and will continue to be a free-to-play MMOTPS as its predecessor.

APB, developed by Grand Theft Auto creator David Jones and Realtime Worlds, made its first entry on PC in 2010 as a subscription based MMO. The original idea was to make the game GTA’s MMO version, but it failed to materialize due to some issues.

The game was then forced to be sold off and released as APB: Reloaded in 2011. However, the latest console version of the game is developed by Reloaded Games and published by Ravenscourt.

APB: Reloaded on Xbox One will remain the same as the PC version. The free to play game will offer the players various vehicles, weapons, customization options and open-world combat for a maximum of 100 players. The players will also get a chance to be either a criminal or a law enforcer in the game.

The game supports micro transactions and is free to download. However, the players will need an Xbox Gold subscription to play the game. The players will have an option to buy the currency used in the game named G1C, which will come in packages ranging from $5 for 400 G1C to $200 for 20,800 G1C.

The developers have also said that the players who play the game before the first patch is released will receive a free Founders Pack, which consists of a vehicle, Fireworks Flare Launcher, etc. To add to this they have also promised free weapon skins and an exclusive in-game title for the players who play more than 10 hours within this period.

Although the release date has not been fixed yet, a PlayStation 4 version of the game is in the works. The blog post of the developers mentions that APB: Reloaded will come to PlayStation 4 after the first patch for Xbox One releases. Initially, both the console versions were scheduled to release in mid 2015.

The blog also mentioned the problems faced by the users of the PC version of the game. They stated:

“As many of you guys are aware, we have been in development limbo (or development hell) for a very long time. The console versions were originally supposed to ship a long time ago and we were contractually obligated to release the new engine on the console version before shipping these changes on PC. Since the new engine performs really well on PC, it has been a bit frustrating to be stuck in this mode for this long.”

They went on to add that the PC version will gain from the fact that the console versions are finally releasing.The full blog post about APB: Reloaded can be read here.","This popular GTA-styled MMO quietly launched on Xbox One, has a $200 DLC pack"
"A new melee system, for hand to hand combat. ",https://fraghero.com/battlefield-1-producer-has-teased-a-brutal-new-feature-for-the-game/,"Battlefield 1 got a ton of new information outlined during a interview, one of the game’s multiplayer producers named Andreas Morell, did. The interview teased a lot of cool upcoming reveals including an updated hand-to-hand combat system.

Earlier this week, it was confirmed that Battlefield 1 would be getting its first proper gameplay reveal during E3, where the game’s 64-player multiplayer mode will be shown to the public and press for the first time.

The producer teased some really interesting stuff when speaking to OXM (Official Xbox Magazine), the most interesting of which was a new melee system that the team is adding to the game, especially in the multiplayer portion.

Although he didn’t go into details but he was quick to state that since Battlefield 1 takes place during world war 1, the game is from an era which didn’t have modern day weapons or combat, and hand-to-hand combat among soldiers was almost medieval. This brutal style of melee combat would be portrayed in the game, according to him.

When you look at the kind of all-out war, you have air, land, sea and a big part of the fighting on the actual ground was almost the – if you put yourself in the position of the soldiers back then when they got their state-of- the-art machine guns, but then they can turn the corner and then there is a guy with a big trench mace, it’s almost medieval and it’s that clash of those two worlds that we felt like this is really something that we need to have in the game and it really adds something to it. It’s a brutal side to – brutal and personal side to kind of the combat in Battlefield 1.

He also confirmed that the levolution mechanic that Battlefield 4 introduced and Hardline also utilized, would be making a return with Battlefield 1. The system would also be enhanced and the team was hard at work creating a more ‘dynamic destruction’ experience with the new game. Battleships were also confirmed for the game but he didn’t really confirm whether or not Zeppelins would also be a part of the game.

Expect a lot more to be seen during E3 that’s scheduled for later this month but it seems EA is preparing to drop a whole lot of new information about the game soon and we’re really excited to see it get revealed.",Battlefield 1 producer has teased a brutal new feature for the game
Cheating. ,https://fraghero.com/heres-why-blizzard-is-already-banning-thousands-of-overwatch-players/,"It seems Blizzard isn’t one to go back on its words. Last month it promised that it’ll ban any cheaters or hackers in Overwatch, and there will be no second chances provided.

Fast forward to now, only a few days after the game’s official launch, and it’s already coming good on its promise by banning thousands of Overwatch players.

Anyone using Overwatch cheat programs are being banned by Blizzard, and the company unleashed a massive ban wave yesterday that forced the program’s creators to actually shut down the servers until they figure out how to bypass Blizzard’s security.

That’s not all, however. A PC Gamer report mentions that Blizzard is banning cheaters not only once, but several times. This means if you’ve cheated, buying a new copy might not be enough. Several users are reporting that Blizzard banned them again after they bought a new copy. A few even tried buying a 3rd copy and yet they got banned within 24 hours of playing the game.

Blizzard’s even taken a more brutal stance in China. The company, along with its partner NetEase, has ensured it bans anyone stupid enough to try cheating in the game. It unleashed a massive 1572 person ban wave earlier today. The company went a step ahead as far as savagery is concerned and revealed all the names it had banned due to cheating.

The moral of this story is clear as day, and it’s that you should not even think about cheating while playing Overwatch. No matter how smart you think you are, it’ll only end in one result, and that’s getting banned not once, but possibly forever. And no, using a VPN might not be enough since many users have reported that Blizzard managed to ban them even though they used a VPN.

The only solution: play fair and do not cheat. Simple?",Here’s Why Blizzard Is Already Banning Thousands Of Overwatch Players
"Not really. Currently it's just (an artists) concept art, importing Liberty City locations to the new engine. ",https://fraghero.com/leaked-screenshot-shows-liberty-city-gta-v-campaign-dlc-way/,"Hold off your horses, but an artist working with Rockstar has revealed a screenshot of an area featured in GTA IV’s Liberty City remade inside GTA V’s gameworld which uses the RAGE engine. The image was found on a portfolio website.

The image was found by two GTA Forums users Spider Vice and BlackScout. The artist, Adrian Page, who’s currently employed by Rockstar Games, had uploaded a bunch of in-engine concept arts to his resume. Interestingly, one of them is the recreated version of Liberty City’s Middle Park location, using the RAGE engine in GTA V’s gameworld.

Adding fuel to the possibility of a single player DLC pack featuring Liberty City in GTA V is that fact that ex-Rockstar North president, Leslie Benzies had confirmed that there was the chance of “one big world containing all our cities [that] let the player fly between them and revisit their favorite areas”.

This was way back in 2012 and there has not been a single campaign DLC pack launched for the game ever. Could Rockstar be secretly working on one without revealing any details?

Take this with a grain of salt due to multiple factors, for starters, this doesn’t confirm that Liberty City is coming to GTA V simply because it can be merely a concept art by the artist with no actual involvement from Rockstar.

This could also be porting work done to test how it looks when made using the RAGE engine. It can also be content that is no longer in development, or just a passion project for the particular artist to make his resume look more interesting.

Keeping the cynicism aside, the possibility of this actually meaning something can’t be ruled out either. Rockstar Games just announced its biggest GTA Online DLC pack ever and the fact that it might be preparing to announce a campaign DLC for GTA V soon isn’t really clutching at straws either. If there are any more updates regarding this, we’ll be the first to let you know.","Leaked: Screenshot Shows Liberty City in GTA V, Campaign DLC On The Way?"
Over 92 hours. ,https://fraghero.com/this-overwatch-player-has-already-reached-level-100-heres-how-many-hours-hes-played/,"Overwatch has been out for merely over a week now and the game’s doing really well. Activision Blizzard has pulled off a stunner and the community playing the game grows with every passing day.

The game has also managed to win over the critics and the gaming community has been extremely vocal about how good the game is. Some gamers are playing the game for hours on end and one of them has already managed to reach the coveted level 100 rank in the game.

Twitch streamer FenderellaKN has accomplished this in about 7 days and he made a stream celebrating this achievement earlier this week. The streamer and Overwatch addict has clocked over 92 hours in the game so far and the average streaming session lasts for around 15 hours. Crazy.

He also mentioned that he plays the game for about 13 hours a day on an average. He prefers playing as Pharah, the offensive tactical hero the most, and he has a 51 percent win rate. The guy’s played a total of 727 games (might have increased now) the last time we checked.

Interestingly, Overwatch doesn’t have a level cap however your level is reset to 1 after reaching 100. This means 101 level would show up as 1 but you get a cool new border every time you reach the level 100 rank and also a star under your profile pic. (image above).

During a reddit AMA, the streamer assured that he didn’t game share with anyone else and has reached the prestigious rank all by himself. His streams are a testament to this claim and it’s definitely not an easy feat, considering the game’s just out for little more than a week right now.","This Overwatch Player has Already Reached Level 100, Here’s How Many Hours He’s Played"

"Weather conditions and time of day, both will be pre-selected before the match. ",https://www.cnet.com/news/ps4s-gran-turismo-sport-lacks-these-two-major-features-of-past-games/,"As suspected, upcoming PlayStation 4 racing game Gran Turismo Sport will not offer dynamic time or weather. Series creator Kazunori Yamauchi explained to GT Planet that these options, which were key features in Polyphony's PlayStation 3 Gran Turismo games, were dropped in an effort to improve the game's overall presentation.

Weather conditions and time of day will instead be pre-match options.

""We opted to not have the transitions in the race this time in order to raise the frame rate and the quality of the image during the race,"" he said. ""So the user will be able to set that before they enter the race. So you'll still be able to have night races, morning, races at dawn, dusk and so on.""

During the Gran Turismo Sport announcement event this month, Yamauchi suggested that the game would not feature dynamic weather. This appears to be the first time he's confirming that the game won't have dynamic weather or time.

Players may be happy to learn, however, that Gran Turismo Sport will have a damage system, even though it was not present in a recent demonstration of the game. Yamauchi has also identified 1080p and 60 frames per second as Polyphony's targets for the game

Gran Turismo Sport marks the Gran Turismo series' debut on PS4. Originally announced late last year, we finally learned some hard details earlier this month. It'll include more than 130 cars and support for online and offline play, though its scope is more limited than the standard numbered releases.

Sombra. More details in comments. ,https://fraghero.com/overwatch-has-a-secret-character-and-shes-going-to-be-revealed-soon/,"A new character might be on its way for joining the Overwatch roster soon. Cyber detectives and some Overwatch fans are hopeful about this and are keeping a keen eye on the hints provided by Blizzard on their videos. They are also gathering all the information about the new character available on the web and piecing them together.

A story about this was covered in detail by NeoGaf, where they compiled a couple of sources which indicates that the new support character named Sombra can come to Overwatch soon.

To start with, they pointed out to a French theater ad which suggested that Sombra will be unveiled for Overwatch soon. Soon after, the theater where the ad was shown later claimed that the tease in the ad was a typo. However NeoGaf user, Nirolak, who compiled the article believes that the theater is lying as Blizzard had already confirmed about working on two new heroes.

Pointing at the second clue Nirolak wrote, “Way back in November, people noticed that there’s a table in Dorado with files for Soldier 76/Jack Morrison and Sombra. Given Soldier 76 is Jack Morrison, this only leaves the mysterious Sombra file, which would fit with a Soldier 76 vs. Sombra animated short.”

Sombra has also made several appearances in various stages. She wears a metal grey helmet which is highlighted by blue, along with a gray over hood and a blue under hood. The grey and blue combination in her outfit is the main reason she is thought to have ties with Soldier 76 and Reaper.

Nirolak also mentioned about Reaper’s dialogue in the game where he says, “Where is Sombra when you need her?”, which can be another massive hint.

Apart from these, there has also been information that Sombra was seen in the character select screen along with a sniper scope, which is another strong signal that the character might be on its way to Overwatch soon.

There are also speculations that Sombra could well be a villain, who would join the other villains on the game later. Overwatch is already short of villains and this can be a logical speculation, but anything cannot be confirmed until we hear it from Blizzard.

At this point we can certainly say that there’s something or someone called Sombra, which is directly or indirectly related to Overwatch, but it’ll be interesting to find out what Blizzard thinks on this.

Among them all, however, there are two mysterious figures that very little has been known about, until now that is.

25 years after Street Fighter 2 hit arcades, Capcom has finally revealed the identities of the first two characters you'd see when playing the game.

In a post on the Street Fighter subreddit, Capcom confirmed the two gentlemen duking it out in front of a cheering crowd are Max and Scott. For those who need a refresher, take a look at them in the video below.

Capcom has also published official bios for both characters, though it's in Japanese. Since Street Fighter 5 is set after Street Fighter 2, the characters have been redesigned somewhat.

Why is Capcom talking about these two fighters? Could they be added as DLC characters? Probably not. What's more likely is that it's just a bit of fleshing the universe out for fans. At most, they may be included in the upcoming story mode expansion.

A dead snake. ,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/electrician-tries-to-fix-broken-ps4-makes-startlin/1100-6440257/?ftag=GSS-05-10aaa0a,"A electrician in Brazil was attempting to fix a busted PlayStation 4, when he discovered a dead snake inside, fused with internal circuits in multiple places.

According to the ViralHog video, the electrician's bug report stated, ""It turned on and then off, and it released a strong smell."" So the man opened up the console, thinking it might be an electrical failure. What he found was the the remains of the small snake.

As you can see in the video, the snake had fused with the circuit board, resulting in the electrical problem--and a nasty smell, apparently.

Check out the full video above (via CNET). There is no word on how the snake got into the console or what species it is.

The tick rate. ,https://fraghero.com/gamer-unhappy-about-overwatch-feature-thats-worse-than-most-fps-games/,"Overwatch has had a great launch and the servers are performing relatively well. However, there’s a little bit of discomfort within members of the game’s community regarding the tick rate.

In case you are wondering what tick rate is, it is the rate at which the server of the game updates every second. The tick rate of a game plays an important role in the responsiveness of the game. The higher the tick rate is, the more responsive the game becomes.

The players of Overwatch are currently facing several issues regarding responsiveness. There have been instances where the players have taken damage, although they were behind cover such as walls or obstacles. Also, some important commands don’t work in a timely manner.

Overwatch‘s current tick rate is 20.8hz which is very low compared to other games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive or Battefield 4 which have tick rates around 60hz. However, the game has an option which allows the tick rate to be raised up to 62.5hz in custom games with high bandwidth options in the settings, but this will not lessen the lag if you are playing with a player with low bandwidth settings.

The video below by YouTuber Battle(non)sense nicely details Overwatch‘s netcode. The video was also acknowledged by the developers of the game, Blizzard:

Overwatch’s lead engineer Tim Ford said, “Your latency is a factor, processing time, interpolation delay – these are all factors. If you are playing a custom tournament against people across the pond (US to UK/Europe) that 60hz update rate’s probably not going to help much because it’s going to be dominated by a latency.” He added: “It’ll still help – it’ll help a lot. It’ll shave off about 20ms on average from the interpolation delay and about 20ms on from the processing time, so that 40ms zone, assuming everyone has a good solid connection, should be good.”

It is certain that Blizzard has kept the tick rate on the lower side to ensure a smooth launch and not to overload the servers. There is a possibility that they will increase the overall tick rate of the game in the time to come.

In their response to GameSpot’s question of whether they will increase the tick rate on the games apart from the custom ones, Blizzard replied,",Gamers Unhappy About Overwatch Feature That’s Worse Than Most FPS Games

",https://fraghero.com/8-games-dying-actually-means-something/,"In an era filled with unlimited respawns and checkpoints scattered around, it really doesn’t make a huge difference if someone dies in a video game. There are usually very limited consequences so more often than not, it allows players to approach a more careless style of game play.

If you are like me and grew up playing arcade games, you usually understood that once you died and ran out of lives, you had to give up the game to the next person in line. Nowadays with millions of people owning their own consoles and computers to play on, they can afford to die repeatedly in the safety of their own home without the added pressure to stay alive in order to keep playing.

A lot of retro games also came to an end for players if they ran through all of their lives without finishing the game successfully. Caution and strategy are important in a lot of games, but even more so when you were not blessed with infinite chances.

However, there are still a few games around that take death seriously. Ranging from penalties to your adventure to the inability to play a character after death, the consequences of dying are not taken lightly in these games. Some deaths even contribute to buffs for the enemy, so dying over and over again can absolutely hinder your progress in a game.

Pysonix has allowed the cross-platform play between the Xbox One and PC versions of Rocket League. The feature was unlocked after an update yesterday at 6 PM ET/3 PM PT.

This is a much awaited feature for the successful vehicle soccer based game, which was promised some time ago. This makes Rocket League the first game to enable cross-platform play between Xbox One and PC. On the other hand, the cross-platform play has already been allowed in Rocket League since its release in PlayStation 4 and PC versions.

Jeremy Dunham, Vice President of Psyonix said, “We’re really excited to bring Xbox One and PC players closer together. Cross-network play has been something that Xbox One gamers have been asking us for since the day we launched, and thanks to Microsoft’s new cross-network policies, we’re proud to give it to them.”

Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that they are interested in allowing Xbox One to support cross network play with Sony’s PlayStation 4. However, Sony didn’t seem too interested in the proposal presented by its counterparts.

While speaking to Eurogamer before, Sony Worldwide Studios’ Shuhei Yoshida said, “Because PC is an open platform it’s much more straightforward. Connecting two different closed networks is much more complicated so we have to work with developers and publishers to understand what it is they are trying to accomplish.” “We also have to look at the technical aspect – and the technical aspect could be the easiest. We also have to look at policy issues and business issues as well.”

Created a queue for purchasing digital copies of the game. ,https://fraghero.com/overwatch-demand-is-so-high-blizzard-is-using-this-desperate-measure-to-keep-up/,"Overwatch is finally out worldwide and the demand for the game has reached an all-time high. Gamers worldwide are lining up to purchase copies of the game. It’s no surprise that Blizzard is having a hard time meeting the demand for physical copies, and they’re trying their best to catch up.

However, you won’t believe that the company is also having issues keeping up with the demand for the digital version of the game. So much so that it’s making gamers queue up to get a chance to purchase a digital copy of the game.

Wait times range from 3 minutes to 10 minutes and the queues are longer than the ones in brick and mortar stores. This just shows how popular Overwatch is and it is looking poised to break a few records.

There might be several reasons why Blizzard might be doing this. For one, its servers might be genuinely getting clobbered at the moment due to too many people trying to purchase the game at once, but there’s also the possibility that this is just a safety measure to safeguard itself against possible DDOS attacks which might severely hinder its ability to meet demands.

Whatever be the reasons, it’s obvious Blizzard must have considered all other options before taking this measure. It might after eventually force potential buyers from delaying their transaction, and in some rare cases, give up on the idea of buying the game altogether.

The game has been in the news for all the right reasons, be it the extremely well-made animated shorts focusing on the story of its characters, or the highly praised beta for the game.

A YouTuber called eNinja and his friends, instead of waiting for the launch of the game, decided to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive as Overwatch characters. I am not really sure whether it is productive or not, but the result is definitely entertaining.

The group’s Counter Strike squad consisted of Overwatch characters Tracer, Widowmaker, McCree, Bastion and Roadhog. They did match the avatars and the names of the characters in the game.

Apart from matching the names and avatars, the team also role-played the whole game as the Overwatch characters. They almost made Counter Strike look like Overwatch with their style of play and the messages.

Everyone used the catch phrases of their respective characters. A player almost looked like a turret when McCree started to moving around firing shots from an R8 revolver while Bastion stayed glued to one spot scanning the opponents and killing anyone who comes to his range.

This is the biggest out of the three DLC packs released so far and Bethesda has claimed that it’s their largest DLC pack landmass wise.

The developers have released a plethora of DLCs for its games and since it’s a traditionally RPG-based game development company, many of its DLC packs have been massive. Claiming that Far Harbor is huge has definitely got the community talking.

Fraghero has now created a time lapse video of one our editors walking across the entire map of Far Harbor at the slowest pace possible. Make no mistake, the map’s huge and it took us almost 30 minutes to go from one end to another, but is it truly the biggest yet?

It is certainly the biggest when it comes to Fallout games, no other DLC released for any Fallout game comes close, but when compared to another Bethesda developed DLC for Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, it isn’t quite the biggest. Shivering Isles took almost 50% more time when compared to this DLC pack, with the final time coming to around 45 mins mark.

To be fair, it’s still quite a large map and Bethesda’s really delivered a meaty DLC pack in the form of Far Harbor. People are still discovering new things in the DLC and the overall feedback has been positive.

For comparison here are the times it took to walk across the other Fallout games and Oblivion’s Shivering Isles DLC.

Other games are played for a month or two, and are then retired onto bookshelves and external hard drives. Then you have Grand Theft Auto, with devoted fans that keep the game alive years after its initial release.

Since the record breaking Grand Theft Auto V was released nearly three years ago, profits from the game have steadily climbed. The implementation of online DLC has been a cash cow for Rockstar Games as well. The game has done so well that it broke eight Guinness World Records right after its release:

best-selling video game in 24 hours

best-selling action-adventure video game in 24 hours

highest grossing video game in 24 hours

fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion

fastest video game to gross $1 billion

highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours

Even though the game has been in circulation for almost three years, it is still in high demand. On Wednesday, Take-Two discussed the game during their latest earnings briefing:

“Grand Theft Auto V has shipped 65 million copies to retailers since it release back in 2013. To put that into perspective, that’s more than the last 3 Call of Duty games combined and roughly the same as the entire Halo franchise.”

This is epic. We all know GTA to be a ridiculously popular game series, but when you compare these figures to other big hitters such as Halo and Call of Duty, it’s even more impressive.

GTA Online will also be getting some “massive, feature-rich” content within the next few months as well, but nothing specific has been spilled yet. Fans have also been aching for more single player content updates, but it is to be determined when, or if, that will happen.",You Won’t Believe How Many Copies Grand Theft Auto V Has Shipped Since Release
No.  Thanks Xander for this post!,http://uproxx.com/gammasquad/xbox-one-ps-4-5-upgrade/,"Console wars. Console wars never change. The hardware arms race to superiority will forever dominate as the main motivation for any company not named Nintendo, or so it once seemed. Reports from around the game industry have dubbed a new iteration of the Playstation 4 the Playstation 4.5, or possibly Playstation 4K thanks to its upgraded GPU which will be used for 4K visuals and the fancy Playstation VR headset. The fact that the Playstation 4, which is still a relatively beefy system three years post-launch, needs an upgrade reeks of the days of gaming past, when kids had to walk uphill both ways to find an N64 ram pack so they could finally play co-op Perfect Dark.

Needless to say, pundits, hardcore gamers and industry leaders aren’t impressed. Yes, technology is moving faster than ever, but had even a whiff of this been known back when Sony was the altruistic heroes of the Xbox DRM meltdown before the launch of the next-gen systems, most gamers may have saved up their cash for a gaming PC.

Speaking after Microsoft’s Build 2016 keynote address, Xbox head Phil Spencer told Gamespot he doesn’t believe in the piece by piece upgrading of systems, and you won’t be seeing that with the Xbox One.

“I’m not a big fan of Xbox One and a half. If we’re going to move forward, I want to move forward in big numbers. For us, our box is doing well. It performs, it’s reliable, the servers are doing well. If we’re going to go forward with anything, like I said, I want it to be a really substantial change for people–an upgrade.”

Of course, this could be the first step in a PC-ified home-gaming experience. One in which gamers will intermittently upgrade their systems and won’t have to shell out $500 every 5-7 years, thus rendering their previous console obsolete. If that’s the case, it will be hard to take the first steps, but Sony could be trailblazing, and that’s never easy to do with the gaming crowd.

It was released early to meet the Star Wars: The Force Awakens movie. ,https://fraghero.com/ea-finally-reveals-why-star-wars-battlefront-didnt-have-a-single-player-campaign/,"Image: starwars.ea.com

Executive Vice President of EA Studios, Patrick Soderlund discussed why Star Wars Battlefront didn’t have single player campaign while speaking during EA’s Investor Day event. Soderlund also hinted that the single player campaign might be introduced in the sequel of the game.

The EA Studios boss mentioned that the decision to leave out the campaign mode from Star Wars Battlefront was purposeful. He said that the decision had to be made in order to release the game early to meet the Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

It is notable that Battlefront had content from Jakku which was also relevant in The Force Awakens. The game, however was based on the original Star Wars Trilogy.

Although the game was a commercial success, Soderlund said that he wasn’t happy with the average review score of the game. The game scores 72 in the PC and PlayStation 4 versions and 75 on Xbox One version on Metacritic.

He said, “The one thing that we got criticized for was the lack of a single-player campaign. It was conscious decision we made due to time and being able to launch the game side-by-side with the movie that came out to get the strongest possible impact.” “I think the team created a really good game based on the premise that we had. I would say the game has done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional EA game. So from that perspective, it’s a success. Are we happy with the 75 rating? No. Is that something we’re going to cure going forward? Absolutely,” he added.

Despite not having a single-player campaign mode, Battlefront does have solo and offline ‘Missions’. He also detailed how EA is looking into the ‘depth and breadth’ before starting a new project.

“The depth and breadth is something that’s proving to be more and more important,” he said. “In a world where we want $60 up front and we expect people to stay with us over the course of a long time, the depth of what we offer is important.” Soderlund added, “We have to go back and course correct that for another version if we were ever to build one.”

On the other hand, EA CFO Blake Jorgenssen said last week that they were working on a sequel to Battlefront which will include content from the recent movies and have better and bigger worlds.

Keeping in mind, Soderlund’s comments, it is safe to assume that the sequel will also feature a single-player campaign, which is bound to strike the right chords with fans.

Update: EA has now confirmed that Star Wars: Battlefront 2 will have a single player campaign. It has also confirmed the first trailer for the game will be shown during the upcoming Star Wars Celebration event in mid April.",EA Finally Reveals Why Star Wars: Battlefront Didn’t Have A Single Player Campaign
The Vice President played a demo and changed his mind. ,https://fraghero.com/battlefield-1s-world-war-1-setting-was-initially-rejected/,"Image: Battlefield.com

EA’s upcoming game Battlefield 1 has received a lot of attention since the reveal trailer was released earlier this month. The main reason of excitement for this new AAA game is the setting.

Unlike most of the other shooting games nowadays, which are set in modern or futuristic universe, Battlefield 1 is set during World War I. This will definitely give the players some new experience and a fresh perspective.

Although we are all excited about Battlefield 1, we are actually lucky that the game’s setting didn’t get rejected. While speaking at the Investors Day event, EA Studios Executive Vice President Patrick Soderlund said that the setting was originally not approved by EA.

The thing that Andrew spoke about in regards to the setting and why we decided to go for World War I, it wasn’t the most obvious choice. If you look at what other partners in our industry are going, they’re going into sci-fi, we had a lot of success with in the modern military space, but we felt that there was a need for a change, and when the team presented to me the idea of World War I, I absolutely rejected it.”

However, things changed after DICE showed him a small demo of what it had in mind. This convinced him that the idea could actually work and the company bit the bullet and it paid off big time.

I said , World War I is trench warfare, it can’t be fun to play.’ But anyway the team continued to persist in the fact that this can be fun, and showed up with a very short demo that convinced me at least that this was the right path

Soderlund was amazed by the reception the trailer for Battlefield 1 got and he seemed very pleased that the audience connected in the way it did with the company’s decision to switch from modern-day setting to world war 1.

The good news is that whenever you take creative risks, and it works, you actually can get to substantial success, and I think that what the internet is telling us with 31 million views and the most seen trailer of the history of EA is that the World War I theme is resonating with players out there. I think we have done something that will be right for the franchise and right for EA.”

Battlefield 1 is looking set to break all kinds of sales records and this might finally be the year when it manages to dethrone the Call of Duty franchise from the number 1 position.",EA “Absolutely Rejected” Battlefield 1’s World War 1 Setting Before This Made It Change Its Minds
"A writer is skeptical about this. So, no. ",http://www.infoworld.com/article/3070678/linux/can-linux-ever-beat-windows-at-pc-gaming.html,"Can Linux ever beat Windows at PC gaming?

Windows has long been the undisputed king of computer operating systems when it comes to gaming. But is Linux getting to the point where it can take on Windows in PC gaming?

A writer at TechRadar remains quite skeptical about the possibility of Linux someday becoming the top gaming operating system for PCs.

Game Carey reports for TechRadar:

Evidently, Windows isn’t going anywhere, with a Steam market share of nearly 96% as of March 2016. In fact, Epic Games even recently called Microsoft out on trying to “monopolize” PC gaming with its Universal Windows Platform initiatives. Although Microsoft has lost sight of what PC gamers want in recent years (see: Games for Windows Live), there’s no doubt that the current Xbox head Phil Spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the Xbox One into Windows 10. In contrast, Valve’s attempts at making Linux not only the best place to play games from your Steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. Despite making an effort with SteamOS, it doesn’t help that a number of companies still haven’t released their November 2015-bound Steam Machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system’s handicaps. There’s a clear winner here, and unless Linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the OS to beat for PC gaming will remain Windows 10.

DistroWatch reviews FreeBSD 10.3’s new features

Jesse Smith at DistroWatch did a full review of FreeBSD 10.0 a while back, and now he has some thoughts to share about the new features that have been added to the recently released FreeBSD 10.3.

Jesse Smith reports for DistroWatch:

FreeBSD is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project’s focus on performance and stability. At the beginning of April the FreeBSD project released version 10.3 of their operating system. The release announcement for FreeBSD 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. Specifically the availability of ZFS boot environments, 64-bit Linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. I was especially eager to try out FreeBSD’s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. The iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) Warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. One of the first things I wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. For those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. Before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. This gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. We then perform any changes or upgrades we want. When we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. This allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. This makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. The PC-BSD and openSUSE projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. The next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit Linux compatibility. FreeBSD has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run Linux executables. There are some restrictions though. For example, up until now the Linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. There is a package in the FreeBSD repository which installs the CentOS core userland software. In essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of CentOS 6 in a directory on our FreeBSD computer. This is handy if we need to run Linux software alongside FreeBSD software or if we want to run Linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. The final feature I wanted to look at was FreeBSD jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older Warden jail management software. Jails on FreeBSD are basically very lightweight virtual machines. Part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. What primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host’s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of FreeBSD. In recent years Docker has provided similar functionality on Linux. More at DistroWatch

Linus Torvalds releases Linux kernel 4.6

Linus has been very busy working on the next release of the Linux kernel, and now Linux 4.6 has been released into the wild.

Simon Sharwood reports on what's new in Linux kernel 4.6 for The Register:

New this time around is support for a bunch more ARM systems-on-a-chip, including Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820. IBM’s POWER9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won’t arrive until late 2016. Whatever CPU you use to run Linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, OrangeFS, XFS, Btrfs and EXT 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while F2FS is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage. Dell’s laptops will play nicer with Linux thanks to driver changes that permit hotkeys to be pressed into service. Raspberry Pi users may appreciate new drivers that are said to do lovely things for 3D graphics performance. More at The Register

If there is enough demand.  Thank you Corbin for the heads up on this!,https://fraghero.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-remasters-developed-one-condition/,"With Activision releasing a remastered Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare later this year and the rising popularity of backwards compatibility, it looks like EA might draft up some remastered Battlefield games in the future. Even though the overall production of remastered games has slowed down for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, it is still something that players desire, especially when it comes to beloved games that many gamers spent hours upon hours playing on last gen consoles.

Talk of remastered Battlefield games can be exciting, especially since the original title, Battlefield 1942, was only released on PC and might be a great addition to the ever-growing collection of first-person shooters available on consoles.

Patrick Soderlund, EA Studios Executive Vice-President, had a recent interview with International Business Times and the topic of remastered Battlefield games was brought up. It looks like there isn’t currently a remaster in the works as of yet, but if there is enough demand from fans the tables can absolutely be turned.

“I wouldn’t say never. We’re not doing it right now, we’re focused on Battlefield 1 – but if we think the fans want that I see no reason we couldn’t.” – Patrick Soderlund

Soderlund further discussed additional details on the upcoming release of Battlefield 1, touching on Zeppelins, the ability to ride horses, and the implementation of aquatic vehicles. With so much work involved with this game, it’s no wonder that remastered versions of previous Battlefield games is not currently on the priority list.

This is the first Battlefield game in many years to take place during the past as opposed to a modern setting, so it can be suggested that EA has listened to what fans actually want to play and made it happen. With that being said, fans wanting remastered Battlefield games should voice their opinions and keep their fingers crossed that EA will listen to them again.",EA Confirms Battlefield Remasters To Be Developed Under One Condition
Call of Duty: Black Ops coming to the Xbox One's backwards compatibility program. ,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-dev-teases-something-for-today-update/1100-6439878/,"[UPDATE] It looks like the announcement Ybarra was referring to was Call of Duty: Black Ops coming to the Xbox One's backwards compatibility program.

The original story is below.

It looks like Microsoft may have some kind of an announcement to make today. Xbox engineering lead Mike Ybarra posted a cryptic message on Twitter last night, signalling something for later today.

Here is the tweet in question:

It would appear that something Xbox-related will be revealed/detailed today. He posted the tweet at 10:21 PM, so 13.5 hours from then would be around 11-12 today.

We'll keep our eyes on this and report back with new information when it becomes available.

Ybarra is a partner director for the Xbox and Windows platforms. He heads up the development on updates for Xbox One and Windows 10 PC, though that doesn't necessarily mean that's what this tease pertains to.

There are also rumors swirling around about Microsoft potentially announcing new hardware. Recently, Xbox boss Phil Spencer even said Microsoft would talk about things ""beyond"" Xbox One and Windows 10 relatively soon. Microsoft's E3 briefing in June is expected to bring even more news, on top of whatever ends up being shown today.

If they use cheats while playing the game it’s going to result in a permanent ban. ,https://fraghero.com/blizzards-warning-to-overwatch-players-would-make-them-think-twice-before-using-cheats/,"Players thinking they might get away with using cheats or exploits in Blizzard’s upcoming team-based MMO Overwatch are going to be left disappointed. The company has made it clear it is going to enforce a no nonsense policy against cheaters.

It’s warned Overwatch players that if they use cheats, even once, while playing the game, it’s going to result in a permanent ban for them. This was announced on the game’s official forums over at Battle.net. The post discussed in details its policy against cheaters and how explained how players can report any suspicious activities they notice while playing the game.

If a player is found to be cheating — or using hacks, bots, or third-party software that provides any sort of unfair advantage — that player will be permanently banned from the game. Full stop,” the company said. “Not only does cheating undermine the spirit of fair play that all of our products are based on, but it works to diminish the fun and enjoyment of others. While we are unlikely to publicly acknowledge when accounts are closed as a result of cheating or using unauthorized programs, we have and will continue to monitorOverwatch for exploitative behavior, as well as take action as needed to preserve the integrity of game.

Blizzard revealed that cheaters can be reported by the community by using an in-game reporting system, that’s present in the PC version, or they can simply email Blizzard at hacks@blizzard.com.

Blizzard assured the community that it’ll be using a complex set of tools to verify if the reports of cheating are accurate, and it won’t solely rely on the game’s replay system to make a decision.

It’s important to note that while video evidence from killcams, Plays of the Game, Highlights, and other community captured footage can be very helpful, we will never use it alone to verify whether or not cheating is taking place. As a result, we encourage players to play nice, play fair and avoid publicly accusing individuals of cheating whenever possible and instead use the reporting methods detailed above.

One of the titles is a Monster Hunter game and, given Capcom's statement that was widely reported yesterday regarding a 'full-scale offensive' for Resident Evil this year, it's probably safe to say at least one of them is a Resident Evil game as well.

Kiss FM reports that a 10-year-old football fan named Roman was given surprise NFL tickets for Christmas from his grandma. The tickets were for the controversial Dallas Cowboys vs. Detroit Lions game last week. Outside the AT&T stadium (based in Dallas), Roman won a local contest during a pregame fan event which consisted of musical chairs. The people officiating the event were associated with the Cowboys (you can tell because of their clothing and the Cowboy mascot on stage), which makes sense considering the location. After winning multiple games of musical chairs, Roman was supposed to get a free copy of Madden NFL 15 on PS4. Upon the realization that Roman was wearing a Lions jersey underneath his jacket, the boy was made to redo the final round. Despite originally winning, someone else won the grand prize because of the clothing Roman was wearing. Roman ended up getting a Batman DVD instead (a full season of the original Adam West series that he most likely didn't even know existed).

"Virtual reality will get more physical, will become and industry-wide effort, and a wireless Rift or Vive won’t happen soon. ",http://time.com/4324598/alienware-interview-virtual-reality/?xid=time_socialflow_facebook,"Strap on a rectangular black headset, and you can traverse a sunken ship at the bottom of the ocean or climb to the top of a snowcapped mountain. That’s the promise of virtual reality (VR) headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.

As impressive as the technology already is, many believe it’s still in its early days. That’s because previous virtual reality-style efforts have flopped in the past. (Nintendo’s Virtual Boy comes to mind.) But the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more.

Few have watched virtual reality evolve as closely as the companies building the hardware that powers it. TIME sat down with Frank Azor, general manager of the Dell-owned gaming PC manufacturer Alienware, and Nelson Gonzalez, Alienware’s cofounder and former CEO, to discuss what they have learned about VR and where they believe it’s headed. Below are the key highlights from our conversation.

Read more: Virtual Reality Buyers Guide: Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive vs. Samsung Gear VR

Virtual reality will get more physical

Anyone who’s seen or tried the HTC Vive knows that some physical activity is involved. The Vive and its two controllers are equipped with sensors that allow players to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush.

But what systems like the Vive or PlayStation VR currently lack is a sense of touch. Although it may look like you’re swinging a golf club, the device in your hand still feels like a video game controller. (The Oculus Rift doesn’t yet support any motion controllers, although the company plans to launch such devices later in 2016.) This is going to be one of the first areas in which virtual reality will improve, says Gonzalez.

“The next evolution of VR would be where you participate physically in that VR world,” Gonzalez said. “And not just sitting down; if you’re a quarterback, you actually get to throw a football, and you can interface with the team. So that kind of stuff, it’s there, it’s going to happen.”

Incorporating better touch controls will only be the start. Azor believes future VR devices could refine concepts first introduced as far back as 1962 with the Sensorama, which incorporated elements like wind and smells.

“Headsets today are doing an excellent job at catering to your visual senses, and a little bit of audio as well,” said Azor, also Alienware’s fourth employee. “Well that’s just two of the senses . . . Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual piece begins to fade.”

It’s unclear exactly how — and if — technologies like those Azor described will ever take shape. But some companies are certainly trying. Leap Motion, a startup which launched a motion-sensing camera for computers in 2013, is now building technology for interacting with VR environments without a controller. Startup Thalmic Labs also makes an armband capable of controlling electronic devices through gestures that works with the Rift.

Read more: Review: Oculus Rift is expensive, complicated, and totally wonderful

VR is an industry-wide effort

The Oculus Rift will likely be remembered as the first modern virtual reality headset. But it takes more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way, says Azor.

Azor draws comparisons to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade. PCs became better equipped to deliver high-end gaming experiences as companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia developed more powerful chips and graphics processors. Games became more accessible on PCs as companies like Steam created platforms for easily buying and browsing content.

“Everyone rallied around [the PC gaming] industry and now we have what we have today,” he said. “VR is the same type of thing; no one company can solve all of the problems.”

A wireless Rift or Vive won’t happen soon

There are two classes of virtual reality devices available today: cheaper, portable devices like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard, and beefier, expensive systems that offer more immersive experiences like the Rift and the Vive. The former plug into your smartphone to deliver VR that’s wireless and convenient, while the latter must be tethered to a PC to power their higher-end performance.

It’s unlikely that we’ll see a high-performance device like the Rift go wireless anytime soon, mostly because wireless technology isn’t advancing at the same pace as VR hardware.

“By the time we solve that, as an industry we’re going to want to give you version two of the product, which is going to become the new benchmark,” Azor said. “Wireless technology is on a different schedule, that’s where the issue comes in . . . The latest and greatest will be wired for a fair amount of time moving forward.”

Any gamer can tell you: Video games ain't cheap. But some systems are certainly more affordable than others.

Quartz reporter Mike Murphy compiled a new collection of data showcasing the price of video game consoles, adjusted for inflation. The results certainly put the $599 Oculus Rift into perspective, as the all-time priciest system is the relatively obscure Neo Geo, which launched in 1990 for the equivalent of $1,179 today. (It was $649.99 back then.)

Take a look:

At least you were getting your money's worth from the Neo Geo. Somewhat unbelievably, the system was still supported as late as 2004, when its final game -- ""Samurai Shodown V Special"" -- was released.

The chart also reveals that Nintendo systems have always been pretty good values. All things equal, Nintendo consoles fall toward the bottom of the list, perhaps because the company places such emphasis on first-party software like ""Mario Kart"" and ""Super Smash Brothers."" The company makes a lot of money on its own games and original properties, in other words.

Some might complain Nintendo's systems also seem a bit outdated by the time they're released -- in terms of sheer horsepower, the Wii lagged behind the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, much as the Wii U is technically less impressive than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

Uncharted 4: A Thief's End launches today.

However if one of those people picking up a physical copy of the game instead of downloading from the PSN store, then you need to know that there's also a whopping 4.978GB day one patch that also need to be downloaded on top of the main game.

The update is essential to the game and prevents players from jumping into the games multiplayer straight away (if that's your thing), on top of a few other core features from the game.

In addition to the multiplayer, the patch also adds the following features to the game:

• Encounter Selection• Character model viewer• Render mode• Single-player skins• Photo Mode

There's also a number of smaller general bug fixes and improvements.

Despite the patch, all players will still be able to continue their adventure through the games main campaign whilst the patch downloads in the background.

So you won't be completely stopped from enjoying, what we believe, is the best game you'll ever see on the PS4.

While we've got you it's also worth reminding you to download a new Uncharted mobile game where you can unlock exclusive rewards for Uncharted 4 before it’s released.

It’s called Uncharted: Fortune Hunter and it’s available as a free download now for iPhone, iPad and Android users.

Effectively this is a top-down puzzle game, where you guide a tiny Nate around mazes.

Occasionally it changes it up bit with some switches or an explosive barrel.

Even Sully drops by now and again.

Completing the puzzles gives you more keys. Keys can then be used to unlock boxes. And boxes contain all sorts of exclusive look for you to use within Uncharted 4's multiplayer.

There’s exclusive outfits, skins and also one-time use boosters.

You’ll even be able to obtain a range of other items, obtainable via Sully's treasure chests in the app.

Here you can get your hands on extra Gear, Heavy Weapons, Mysticals and Sidekicks boosters to use in the Uncharted 4 multiplayer load-outs.",Uncharted 4 gamers MUST do this before playing the terrific PS4 exclusive

Call of Duty Modern Warfare: Remastered is coming, bundled exclusively with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare's special edition release later this year.

But if you were at all worried that this might be nothing more than a glorified HD upscale, with a new lick of paint, then dont you worry.

Developers Raven have done a bang up job completely overhauling the game from the ground up.

The comparrison was shown during Infinity Ward's livestream last night of the new game Infinite Warfare.

Viewers on the stream were treated to some before and after shots of some classic multiplayer maps including: Crash, Backlot and Crossfire.

"A little jaggy, but not bad. ",http://www.techtimes.com/articles/157417/20160511/how-does-overwatch-hold-up-on-consoles.htm,"At times, it feels like Overwatch has been in beta for as long as gamers have known about it.

Blizzard clearly wants to make sure its first new IP in more than 15 years knocks it out of the park: not only have select fans been able to test the game out a number of times over the past year, but the Overwatch team has been quick to incorporate and respond to feedback. Long story short, you simply don't see this sort of long-term, hands-on development cycle very often.

Then again, that last statement really only applies to the PC side of things. Obviously, Blizzard is making sure that the game is the same across all three platforms, but until the recent open beta, console players never had a chance to play Overwatch. PC players knew that the game would be good going in ... but what about fans with an Xbox One or PlayStation 4?

Let's be honest: there's a very good chance that Overwatch will be remembered as a PC game more than anything else. Blizzard is a company that was defined by its library of amazing PC games, and it wasn't until recently that the studio's games even appeared on consoles at all. Thankfully, Overwatch is just as strong on consoles as it is on PC - though fans should expect to see a few differences between the platforms.

If you've played Overwatch on more than one platform, then chances are the first thing you noticed were the differences in presentation. With a decently powerful rig, Overwatch looks absolutely gorgeous: effects and explosions are particularly impressive, though the high-res textures and lighting systems deserve mention as well. It may feature a stylized presentation, but that hasn't stopped Blizzard from making yet another stunning game.

For the most part, the same could be said of the console versions. Both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One manage to hit the 60 fps benchmark and hold it, only dropping a few frames when explosions and Ultimates start flooding the screen. Even then, the frame drops are small and inconsistent - unless you're looking back through recorded footage, chances are you'll never notice it.

The only thing that doesn't seem to hold up is the anti-aliasing: while PC players can choose which settings work best for their system, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions suffer from a bit of aliasing. Again, you won't really notice it if you're not looking for it, though it does stick out as the only notable visual difference.

To this day, the debate between using a mouse-and-keyboard versus playing with a controller still rages on. Some will still say that PC hardware provides the most accurate aiming possible, while others prefer the comfort and simplicity provided by a controller.

Overwatch fans using a mouse-and-keyboard setup probably won't notice anything out of the ordinary. Overwatch plays like any other FPS out there: point, click and hope that your opponent drops before you do. The control scheme may be different than others in the genre, but the actual mechanics of aiming remain the same.

Thankfully, the same could be said when using a controller. While you may have to tweak the sensitivity to your liking, Overwatch still plays beautifully with a pair of analog sticks. It does give the game a slightly different feel, and auto-aim may rub a few people the wrong way, but Blizzard has done a great job of giving console players the same level of control (no pun intended) as PC players.

In most console shooters, players are basically locked into a control scheme - Blizzard, on the other hand, has given console users the ability to completely customize their controls. It may sound simple, but the fact that players can set up separate horizontal and vertical look sensitivities is a big deal - and it could go a long way toward making the game that much more accessible for new players.

It should come as no surprise that Overwatch is a great game. This is Blizzard we're talking about, a company that's willing to completely cancel a game and scrap years of work before releasing a bad game. On top of that, PC players have known that the game was fun ever since the first beta dropped late last year.

However, console players have been burned before.

Overwatch has garnered more than a few comparisons to Team Fortress 2, and for good reason. However, while Team Fortress 2 is still a staple of PC gaming, the sub-par console version died a quick, painful death. There are plenty of players who worry that the same would happen to Overwatch.

While it's still too early to tell what the future holds for Blizzard's new shooter, console fans can rest assured that the game is definitely worth playing on their platform of choice. Overwatch may be known as a PC-centric title now, but we wouldn't be surprised if a dedicated console community popped up, too.

For the time being, we'll just have to wait and see: Overwatch is set for release on May 24.

October 18. ,http://buff.ly/1QU2RB8,"Update 3: EA and DICE have officially announced Battlefield 1 after the game's title and setting leaked this morning. We have a few details up front, though we'll have to wait a bit for more information.

The World War I setting is confirmed, though reports of this being an alternate history are completely inaccurate according to DICE. Battlefield 1 will feature a full campaign, though details are vague beyond its existence.

As expected, the setting will give EA and DICE a push toward trench warfare, though vehicles will, of course, return. This time out, the multiplayer will feature specific classes for vehicles, including pilots and tank drivers.

Battlefield 1 will be out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 21. The date mentioned in the poster below refers to EA and Origin Access early play time that begins on October 18.

Update 2: Another shot of materials includes what may very well be the release date for the game. If accurate, the next Battlefield is launching on October 18. Additionally, as managing editor Matt Bertz pointed out to me when the keyart first appeared, the Harlem Hellfighters (mentioned on one of the posters and officially known as the 369th Infantry Division) is connected to the game. The regiment consisted of African Americans and worked closely with the French during the war.

Update 1: And another leak gives us what seems to be the name: Battlefield 1. That's stylized as the number and not the roman numeral, as soon in what appears to be a retail poster bearing the same art shared to Reddit.

Original Story (May 6, 2016 @ 10:09 a.m. Central): EA and DICE are getting ready to reveal their next Battlefield game later today, but Microsoft seems intent on spoiling the party. On Xbox One right now, you can see a tile promoting the live reveal with art that clearly points to a World War I setting.

While the mauser in the character’s hand isn’t a giveaway (it was in use from the late 1800s through the mid-1900s), the spiked club in his other is a tell. That’s a trench mace that was in use during the first world war.

The setting was rumored earlier this year, but we’ll learn more later today when the game is revealed. We had some thoughts about a Battlefield game set in World War I, which you can read here.

But take a closer look at the picture. You'll be shocked when you see it!

They make a huge mess and are a total waste of deliciousness, but cake smashes are unarguably always adorable. That’s why when this mom of multiples decided to do one for her daughters’ first birthdays, she wanted to make it extra special.

UK mom Lara Mason recently posted photos on Facebook showing off her awesome cake smash photoshoot starring her twin daughters, Lyla and Lily. Yep, you read that correctly. Her daughters are twins, not quadruplets.

Now, it’s totally cool if you’re a little confused. We were too. But take a closer look at the picture and you’ll notice the two babies in the middle aren’t babies at all—they’re cakes.

In addition to being a mom, Mason also owns her own bakery where she makes fun customized cakes like the ones you’ve seen on the Food Network and TLC. With her daughters’ birthdays approaching, she decided to go big and make cake versions of her baby girls. “Not a lot of other people do this crazy thing that I do so I thought to myself… Why not?!” she wrote in her Facebook post. “I mean, what other kids get to say that their mum made them life-size cakes of themselves for their 1st birthday!?” Take a look at the video she posted along side her photos:

Now, we’ve seen a lot of those cake shows, so we know that making cake people look even somewhat realistic is a super tall order. And because they were her own children, Mason made sure to put extra special care into making these cake figures. “The cakes have taken a fair few hours—I’d say about 100 to 120 hours over the last few weeks,” Mason told the Motherload. “It’s the most critical I have ever been while making ‘cake people’ because I feel like I did such a good job making them so cute in the first place!”

Props to you, Lara Mason. You had a vision and you went for it. We just have one question: Did you and your family eat the cake babies? Because we’re thinking that might be pretty weird.

The following article deals specifically with the specific claim that hand sanitizer will “spontaneously combust” if left in a hot car.

In April 2020, a series of photographs started to circulate on WhatsApp and Telegram that supposedly showed the aftermath of a car fire caused by an unattended bottle of hand sanitizer.

These posts, many of which were written in Portuguese, urged people to be cautious about leaving hand sanitizer in their cars because, they claimed, it can spontaneously combust.

A month or so after these posts went viral in Brazil, a similar rumor started to circulate on English-language pages. In addition to being spread by anonymous social media users, these warnings also made their way onto the pages of a real fire departments. The Western Lakes Fire District of Wisconsin (WLFD) in Wisconsin, for instance, shared the following post to its Facebook page on May 21:

Soon after, a number of news outlets picked up on this story and ran articles about how a fire department was warning people not to leave hand sanitizer in their cars. Although WLFD truly did post the above-displayed warning, the department later removed the post for stirring confusion.

For starters, the picture has not been officially linked to a fire caused by a bottle of hand sanitizer exploding into flame. A number of experts have also weighed in to say that while hand sanitizer does contain alcohol and is flammable, it would require a tremendous amount of heat for spontaneous combustion. Although this sort of fire may be technically possible (more on that later), we’ve yet to see any official reports about a car fire starting this way. Lastly, the WLFD did state that a fire could be started via “magnification of light through the bottle,” but this is true for any plastic bottle and has little to do with its contents.

WLFD deleted its original hand sanitizer warning and replaced it with the following message:

Our goal in the WLFD is to provide timely, accurate, and educational information while responding to the needs of our customers. It’s become clear that a recent post about hand sanitizer was taken in many different directions from our original goal. We want to take the opportunity to clear up some misunderstandings and assure our position is understood. While we never made the claim that the photo utilized was from our district or from an exploding container of hand sanitizer, it has become clear that that inference and speculation made is seem as though it was. It was to illustrate a door fire resulting from contact with open flame which was the center of our post. Our message was intended to center on preventing fire or injury from the use of hand sanitizer. It also regarded the past history of issues stemming from clear bottles being stored in vehicles. These bottles typically store bottled water or as of late; hand sanitizer. While infrequent, there have been cases in the recent past were reflecting light placed through a clear bottle was able to focus onto a combustible surface and cause a fire. This has primarily been through water bottles but since hand sanitizer is often stored in the same vessel we wanted to pass it along for your safety. The principle is identical and obviously an additional issue would occur if it happened in the presence of an alcohol based product. The open flame comment was to remind people that when hand sanitizer is wet on any surface it will ignite when exposed to flame. With the recent increase in utilization of this product we wanted to remind our customers that it’s important not to allow this to occur. Many people have been sequestered in their homes and with an upcoming holiday accompanied with nice weather we knew grilling, fire pits, and other enjoyments would be in place. While we never referenced grilling in one’s vehicle, we did center on smoking and wanted to assure that the correlation was made illustrating that is also an open flame. We didn’t want anyone injured exercising good hygiene practices and then unintentionally coming in contact with open flame. Video representation of this happening is included for our fans to watch. We simply want our customers to be happy healthy and well and most importantly enjoy the time they have together with family and friends. Our message quickly came became misconstrued and we wanted to assure that we made it right. We apologize for any confusion and wish you an enjoyable holiday weekend.

Judging from the amount of mail Snopes received, many people were still confused about what dangers may lurk in bottles of hand sanitizer. So let’s take a closer look at the questions this viral post sparked.

Is Hand Sanitizer Flammable?

Many hand sanitizers contain alcohol, and these alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) are flammable. The Federal Aviation Administration wrote in a 2010 report:

As expected, hand sanitizer is flammable and can easily be ignited with a common grill lighter when poured into a pan. It tends to burn relatively cool, compared to fuel, plastic, or cellulose fires with peak flame temperatures between 500° and 1000°F. The observed temperatures above the flame were higher for the liquid hand sanitizer compared to the gel.

Hand sanitizers also give off vapors, and these vapors are also flammable.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes:

ABHS contains ethyl alcohol, which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor, and is considered a flammable liquid. Although the incidence of fires related to ABHS is very low, it is vital that ABHS is stored safely and that bulk dispensers are installed and maintained correctly.

Can Hand Sanitizer Spontaneously Combust?

One of the major fears that people had after encountering this rumor on social media was that their hand sanitizer was going to “spontaneously combust” if left too long in a hot car. We won’t say that this is impossible, but we will say that it is extremely unlikely.

According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), hand sanitizer would have to be exposed to extreme heats (over 700 degrees Fahrenheit) in order to spontaneously combust.

Spontaneous ignition, on the other hand, involves a substance self-heating to a point where it ignites, without the need for any outside ignition source like a flame. Hand sanitizer is not subject to self-heating and would require temperatures to reach over 700 degrees Fahrenheit to spontaneously ignite, according to Guy Colonna, director of Technical Services at NFPA.

Those sort of temperatures just aren’t going to be seen inside of a parked car (so long as that car is parked on Earth). A 2018 study published in the journal Temperature found that the average temperature in a parked car on a 95-degree day was about 116 degrees. Specific parts of the car, such as the dashboard, climbed closer to 160 degrees, but that is still far from the 700 degrees needed for spontaneous combustion.

The NFPA continued:

“Spontaneous ignition would be an ignition source independent of a flame or a spark, [and] it requires a material that is reactive to do what’s called self-heat,” Colonna says in a new video interview on the topic (above). “Internally, it undergoes a reaction and changes its properties, and when changing its properties, it releases lots of heat energy. Hand sanitizer, the alcohol [in it], is a material not inclined to do that. … The ignition temperature of the alcohols are going to be something in excess of 700 degrees Fahrenheit.” In other words, while hand sanitizer gives off ignitable vapors at roughly room temperature or above, that vapor-air mixture still needs to be exposed to very high temperatures to ignite. A flame can do it. A hot car can’t.

Can a Bottle of Hand Sanitizer Focus Sunlight into a Strong Enough Heat Source to Start a Fire?

This claim has more to do with the magnification properties of plastic bottles than it does with the contents of said bottles. In fact, in 2017, a similar warning was circulated on social media that said leaving a water bottle in your car on a hot day could result in a fire.

Live Science wrote:

Leaving a water bottle sitting in your car sounds benign enough. But on a hot, summer day, the plastic can act as a lens, focusing light into a high-energy beam that’s intense enough to burn material like car-seat upholstery. […] “The water bottle is acting like a lens that’s focusing the light coming through the window,” Odile Madden, a materials scientist at the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles, told Live Science. Light consists of numerous photons, which are subatomic particles that travel in a straight line, Madden said. Eyeglass and microscope lenses direct the photons so they converge on a point. “You can use that to see something better, get it in focus. Or, you can focus a lot of light onto a very small point and concentrate all that energy, and that can cause melting and burning,” Madden explained.

Although it is technically possible for a fire to start in this manner, again, it is very unlikely. The sun, the bottle, and a flammable source would all have to be in perfect alignment on a rather hot day to ignite a fire.

In June 2020, Illinois’ Waukegan Fire Department reported that a small bottle of hand sanitizer had started a car fire. The organization later amended their statement to clarify that the fire was started in the manner described above — a plastic bottle focusing direct sunlight into beam hot enough to start a fire — so its cause was unrelated to the substance in the bottle.

All Smoke and No Flame?

The claim that hand sanitizer was causing car fires first gained traction in Brazil in April 2020 via social media posts on WhatsApp. This spurred the country’s Corpo de Bombeiros de Campo Grande (Campo Grande Fire Department) to issue a warning about the potential dangers of leaving hand sanitizer in a hot car. However, the fire department admitted that it had yet to see any fires caused in such a manner. Likewise, we have yet to uncover any confirmed reports about hand sanitizer causing a fire while left in a parked car on a hot day.

However, many hand sanitizers are still flammable and do pose some risks. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should not be used near open flames, and people storing large amounts of hand sanitizer should adhere to the National Fire Protection Association’s Flammable and Combustible Liquids code.

Although keeping a small bottle of hand sanitizer in your car won’t result in spontaneous combustion, cautious drivers may want to store their hand sanitizer (and any other liquids kept in plastic bottles) out of direct sunlight in their glove boxes or center consoles.",Will Hand Sanitizer Combust If Left in a Hot Car?

By his count, it took him 4,200 hours and 720,000 photos to get a perfect shot of a Kingfisher diving straight into the water without a single splash.

“The photo I was going for of the perfect dive, flawlessly straight, with no splash required not only me to be in the right place and get a fortunate shot but also for the bird itself to get it perfect,” McFadyen told The Herald Scotland. “I would often go and take 600 pictures in a session, and not a single one of them be any good. However, looking back on the thousands and thousands of photos I have taken to get this one image, it makes me realize just how much work I have done to get it.”

The common kingfisher is mostly known for his very bright plumage, that is quite atypical for birds living in colder climates. The bird usually lives near bodies of water and catches their prey by diving.

McFadyen, who also runs a wildlife photography side business, was inspired to love nature and wildlife by his grandfather. “I remember my grandfather taking me to see the kingfisher nest, and I remember being completely blown away by how magnificent the birds are. So when I took up photography, I returned to this same spot to photograph the kingfishers.”

It took Alan McFadyen 6 years, 4,200 hours and 720,000 photos to get this shot:

“The photo I was going for of the perfect dive, flawlessly straight, with no splash required not only me to be in the right place and get a fortunate shot but also for the bird itself to get it perfect.”

“I would often go and take 600 pictures in a session, and not a single one of them be any good”

“I never really stopped to think about how long it was taking along the way as I enjoyed doing it but now I look back on it I’m really proud of the picture and the work I put in.”

“I remember my grandfather taking me to see the kingfisher nest, and I just remember being completely blown away by how magnificent the birds are”

“I’m sure my grandfather would have loved it, I just wish he could have seen it. All of my family contacted me when they saw it and said he would have been so proud of it.”","After 6 Years And 720,000 Attempts, Photographer Finally Takes Perfect Shot Of Kingfisher"

According to Joanna, giving your home a good deep clean isn't just about sprucing up: The best thing you can do is identify things you don't need anymore and throw them away for good.

""I can't stress this enough—your whole family will feel the benefits of rooms and spaces that can breathe, so before you even start the cleaning, get five trash bags and start filling them with items your family has outgrown or no longer needs,"" wrote Joanna. ""If you don't love it, toss it.""

If you have (or have ever had) young children in your home, you likely have toys or clothes sitting around that haven't been touched in a long time. ""Trash anything that is broken and serves no purpose and donate items to local shelters and you'll feel much better before you even start,"" wrote Joanna.

Considering Chip doesn't go to an antiques shop without buying something, well, odd, we can only imagine how he feels about this.

Calling someone you're close to by the name of someone else you're close to is actually a sign that you care for them dearly. #Stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/life/a42323/scientific-reason-why-moms-mess-up-their-kids-names/?src=socialflowFB&fbclid=IwAR35LI5UF4HKV0_IXvqVzk2GHGcgAFzzkgjUOrW1uf2xhIs1s0Pmx0PQhBc,"How often, while you were growing up, did your mom call you by your sibling's name? And how often do you find yourself doing the same now? This is a weird phenomenon, because you'd associate forgetfulness with unfamiliarity — and that's definitely not something you could accuse mothers of.

But misnaming isn't a result of poor memory, frazzled mom syndrome, the two people looking alike, the similarity of the names that are confused and misused, or even because they're straight up not that important to you.

Sorry, Ron Swanson. You're way off base here.

Misnaming is actually a sign of love. Calling someone you're close to by the name of someone else you're close to is actually a sign that you care for them dearly, according to an investigation published in the journalMemory & Cognition.

The researchers (all current or former members of the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University) conducted five studies and spoke with over 1,700 participants to examine the so-called ""misnaming phenomenon"" among familiar individuals. They reached their conclusion after observing that misnaming typically happens ""within a social group."" With moms, this means that they typically call their child by their sibling's name – not the name of a random kid down the block who sorta looks like them, or someone they saw on TV.

This is thanks to the way our minds store people's names and information about them, according to the report. The brain uses a ""semantic network"" (essentially, a filing system) where similar or related information is stored ""next to"" each other. So when your brain is looking for your firstborn Tommy's name so you can holler at him to put away his laundry, it might accidentally pull the wrong ""file"" from the ""family folder"" and out comes your other son Joey's name.

Of course, this phenomenon isn't exclusive to parents. The researchers even cite one of the most infamous pop culture examples of misnaming – Ross saying Rachel instead of Emily during his wedding vows in Friends.

So don't worry, your #mombrain is failing you if you can't keep your kids' or friends' names straight. ""It's a normal cognitive glitch,"" researcher Samantha Deffler assured NPR during a January interview about the study. Deffler, too, reported that her own mother used to mess up her siblings' names – with even the family dog's name thrown in. Gotta love those fur babies.

When you open a fashion brand's catalog or shop for a new dress online, you probably assume that the models wearing the clothes don't look like that in real life. Photoshop is everywhere in fashion (and sometimes it's rather egregious), but did you know that the images you see in furniture catalogs might also not be what they seem?

Recently, IKEA revealed that 75% of the photos in its catalog are actually CGI, meaning they've been produced not on a set with real furniture, but at a desk on a computer.

At first hearing this, we couldn't believe all those cozy, well-designed rooms didn't really exist. But IKEA says that producing their catalog digitally is more efficient and eco-friendly, as they don't have to build sets and transport furniture that would ultimately be discarded.

""The most expensive and complicated things we have to create and shoot are kitchens,"" Martin Enthed, an IKEA IT manager, told CG Society. ""From both an environmental and time point of view, we don't want to have to ship in all those white-goods from everywhere, shoot them and then ship them all back again. And unfortunately, kitchens are one of those rooms that differ very much depending on where you are in the world. A kitchen in the US will look very different to a kitchen in Japan, for example, or in Germany. So you need lots of different layouts in order to localise the kitchen area in brochures.""

But wary consumers need not get up in arms. Enthed also stresses that he knows it's important for shoppers to know exactly what they're getting when they buy furniture, so his team takes painstaking steps to mimic the real-life product as best they can.

PCOS (Polycycstic Ovarian Syndrome). There is no one symptom which is a direct indication of it. #stopclickbait,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-facts?fbclid=IwAR1Ccm-XvWtj9ZNGj5N7r-cSFfbvvuH6SXzjJeB_4zB2LZYd7sOBcM-NnPA,"Usually the script is simple when you’re sick: You feel crummy. You go to the doctor. A test reveals the issue at hand. But that’s not the sitch with all health conditions. Case in point: polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

While PCOS is classically associated with irregular cycles or missed periods, it’s also easy to miss: Maybe you blame your crazy cycle on other factors. Or, because PCOS is categorized by a slew of signs and symptoms (and isn’t diagnosed by one test), it might even go unnoticed. In fact, less than 50 percent of women with PCOS know they have it, according the PCOS Foundation. But it’s actually a fairly common ovulation issue. Between five and 10 percent of menstruating young women have it, says Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine. Here’s what you need to know about the disorder:

There’s a Group of Symptoms

Just like there's no one test to diagnose PCOS, there’s no one symptom that signifies its presence. Irregular or absent periods can be a sign. Acne, excessive hair (a.k.a. hirsutism, which is when you develop hair in so-called male pattern areas), infertility, and weight gain are also all linked with PCOS, says Mamta Mamik, M.D., an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive science at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. So are metabolic issues like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and even diabetes.

If any of this sounds familiar, check in with your gynecologist, suggests Minkin. Many times, docs will order blood tests to look for wonky levels of sex hormones, like too much testosterone, she says. Your ovaries and adrenal glands make testosterone normally, but if you have PCOS, you make increased amounts. You might also have abnormal glucose levels, she says.

...But Cysts Aren’t Everything

Despite its name, not all women with PCOS have cysts on their ovaries, says Mamik. If you do have cysts, they’re often described as a string of pearls—and if they burst, it can be super-painful. The cysts are sometimes a result of a woman's eggs not being released over time, and can be ID'd through an ultrasound.

It’s a Weighty Matter

PCOS may be genetic, says Mamik. Some research suggests if your mom has it, there’s a 50 percent chance you could, too. But the condition is also associated with being overweight, says Minkin. “One of the conundrums is whether or not you develop PCOS and then gain weight or gain weight and then develop PCOS,” she says. “Probably, both can happen.” If you do have PCOS and are overweight, a weight loss plan (good nutrition and an exercise program) is vital, says Minkin. “Weight loss really helps to normalize the abnormalities,” she says.

Treatment Options Vary

Here’s the good news: “In general, the treatment is quite straightforward,” says Minkin. Beyond addressing any underlying conditions like blood sugar abnormalities or diabetes, your course of action generally depends on where you are in life. If you’re not trying to get pregnant, the easiest remedy is usually the Pill. Oral contraception takes control of your ovaries, forcing them to stop making excess testosterone and controls your periods, says Minkin.

See a baby in the near future? While PCOS can be linked with trouble conceiving, it doesn't mean you’ll never be able to get knocked up, says Mamik. A gynecologist can start you on a medication called Clomid, which gets you ovulating. “Success rates are quite high,” says Minkin. Ultimately, everyone is different, and your ob-gyn can help you come up with the best plan for you based on your medical history and condition.

"The ages which end a decade - 29, 39, 49, with 39 being the largest offending age. #stopclickbait",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-are-people-more-likely-to-cheat-at-age-29_us_57a9f9e6e4b0ba7ed23d87a7?fbclid=IwAR3TuuAQ2t3-LATyP-3gy0OIqzUCFmcLaGDGtgxswCA6H_Qv-hRFS9yCaJk,"WANDER WOMEN COLLECTIVE via Getty Images There is some research to suggest that, in general, people behave differently when they approach a new decade in their age.

The idea that the person you love is betraying your trust and engaging in intimate rendezvous with someone else is emotionally devastating. It’s only natural to look for patterns and warning signs to avoid being cheated on.

Now, a new report suggests that people are twice as likely to cheat at the “danger age” of 39, and are also more likely to have affairs during the last years of other decades — for example, at age 29 or 49 — than at other times. The findings come from research done by the U.K.-based website IllicitEncounters.com, and were first reported by The Sun.

Do other studies of infidelity back up this claim?

There is some research to suggest that, in general, people behave differently when they approach a new decade in their age. In 2014, researchers Adam L. Alter and Hal E. Hershfield at New York University and the University of California, Los Angeles, respectively, performed six studies to investigate the behaviors of adults during their “9-ending ages” (ages 29, 39, 49, etc.), including their propensity for extramarital affairs. The researchers obtained data from an online dating site similar to Illicit Encounters, where users are already in supposedly monogamous relationships. [I Don’t: 5 Myths About Marriage]

Alter and Hershfield calculated the total number of male users on the site (8,077,820) and compared that to the number of 9-ender male users (952,176). They found there were 18 percent more 9-enders registered than there would be if the site’s users represented a completely random sample of ages.

Across the six studies, Alter and Hershfield also found that 9-enders reported being particularly preoccupied with aging, and were more likely to wonder whether their lives were meaningful.

This could lead to a rise in behaviors that “suggest a search for, or a crisis of meaning,” such as an affair, the researchers said.

In general, infidelity is difficult to study because it’s challenging for researchers to find willing participants and to gather accurate reports, and cheating itself is defined inconsistently across relationships, said Christin Munsch, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut, who was not affiliated with the Illicit Encounters research but does study infidelity.

The Illicit Encounters’ research may not be unbiased: the company is financially backing the study, methods were not vetted by outside experts, and it was not peer-reviewed.

Munsch said that the findings of the Illicit Encounters study could just suggest that people looking to have affairs might not be honest about their age in their profiles. [How Do I Love Thee? Experts Count 8 Ways]

However, in their research, Alter and Hershfield looked at how people on dating sites might approach lying about their age. They asked users to imagine they were trying to fool a potential date into believing they were as young as possible while remaining within the bounds of plausibility. Their data suggested that the most frequent responses were ages ending in 5.

While these aren’t definitive findings, they suggest that a lying 30-year-old is more likely to say they’re 25 than 29.

In her own research, Munsch looked at data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), an anonymous, nationally representative survey of people born between 1980 and 1984 that was conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor. She compared people’s marital status with their responses to questions about whether they had multiple sex partners in the past year, and whether they had had sex with a stranger. Anyone who was married and answered yes to these questions was coded as unfaithful.

She found that for both men and women, being economically dependent (making less money than your spouse) was correlated to increased rates of cheating.

“The less money you make relative to your spouse, the more likely you are to cheat. We compare ourselves: you don’t want to see yourself coming out on the losing end,” Munsch told Live Science.

In 2012, Munsch reviewed the literature for trends surrounding infidelity. With regards to age, she found that as people get older they are more likely to cheat, and that may be because there are simply more opportunities to be unfaithful.

Munsch said that for men, being economically dependent may be worse because they may feel expected by society to be breadwinners. Cheating can be a way for men to simultaneously bolster their masculinity and get back at their breadwinner wives. [Busted! 6 Gender Myths in the Bedroom & Beyond]

According to Munsch, the recipe for avoiding an affair is pretty simple.

“From a sociological perspective, one of the biggest predictors of infidelity is opportunity. If I’m trying to lose weight, I don’t keep cookies in the house. The same principle applies here. If you’re looking for a ‘magic bullet,’ don’t be in the situation” where cheating could happen.

And although it’s tempting try to analyze data to predict who will cheat, putting the results in perspective is important, she said. For example, her research showed that the likelihood of infidelity jumps from around 5 percent for men whose wives make equal financial contributions to 15 percent for men who are economically dependent on their wives.

“That’s three times more likely. But 85 percent of men [who are dependent on their wives] aren’t cheating,” she said.

Ultimately, many variables factor into infidelity. Munsch said that there are certain psychological traits that are correlated to cheating, such as extreme risk-taking behavior or low morality, and that people’s environment also plays a role. If a person with certain traits gets placed in a situation of high opportunity, that can be a good indicator that infidelity will take place.

But by the same token, a person with all the necessary predispositions can be put in an ideal circumstance to cheat and still not do it.

Munsch said that the “9-ending ages” theory is “certainly plausible,” but that predicting any complex human behaviorremains an inexact science.

Atopic dermatitis is a form of eczema which affects babies and can cause complications later in life such as sleep problems and allergies. Moisturizing babies with Vaseline would (likely) solve the problem. #stopclickbait,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vaseline-cheap-eczema-prevention_us_584afad3e4b04c8e2bafb25b?fbclid=IwAR18eXwkcpePHLffXuP3ar8JonhLDQSYobU9ImcK70i2VTb9gsXWMEWVIxU,"On the surface, eczema may seem like an ailment that is more annoying than debilitating. But for the more than 20 percent of kids who struggle with it, the effects can be more severe ― and costly (really costly) for their parents.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common form of eczema, and tends to develop in infants. It can be either lifelong and chronic or go away on its own over time, and is linked to hay fever, asthma, allergies, sleep problems and weight problems. Data suggests families caring for a child with this type of eczema spend as much as 35 percent of their discretionary income on care each month. Estimates put the total cost of eczema care in the U.S. at up to $3.8 billion per year.

Now, new research suggests that a solution under $10 might be able to help prevent the condition from developing in the first place. The fix? Moisturizing newborns with petroleum jelly until they are six months old.

“We could really save a lot of newborns ― and save families ― a lot of suffering,” researcher Dr. Steve Xu, a resident physician in the department of dermatology at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, told The Huffington Post.

“It’s also a pretty good deal in terms of cost,” he said.

Xu and his team built on a 2014 study of 124 babies, in which researchers from Oregon Health & Science University found that parents cut their newborns’ risk of atopic dermatitis in half when they moisturized them daily (or at least 5 times a week, everywhere but the scalp) for their first six months of life. The parents in the study used either an over-the-counter drugstore ointment, moisturizing cream or sunflower seed oil, all of which provided a similar benefit in terms of preventing eczema.

In a follow up analysis of the research, Xu and his colleagues looked at cost and determined that using a daily moisturizer for a baby’s first six months was cheap ― way cheaper than the costs of dealing with eczema if it develops later on.

A six-month supply of Vaseline petroleum jelly was just $7.30, the cheapest of all the moisturizers in the analysis. And the total cost for the most expensive moisturizer, Vaniply ointment, was $173.39 for a six-month supply.

“We added the economic argument why prophylactic moisturizing is a really really great idea,” Xu said.

There are still a lot of unanswered questions about eczema

Moisturizers are a big part of the way eczema is treated, but until now they haven’t necessarily been used to prevent the problem. The evidence is still unclear as to how they actually help thwart the condition ― in a big part because the evidence is still unclear about what exactly causes atopic dermatitis in the first place ― and why individuals who have it are so likely to go on to develop allergies, hay fever and asthma.

The researchers suspect using moisturizers during infancy helps correct outer-layer skin defects in babies who will go on to develop eczema. Those defects are thought to play a role in how the condition actually develops, along with hereditary and environmental factors, too.

Whether or not preventing eczema would also prevent the allergies, hay fever and asthma that come along with it is yet another unsolved question. But there’s a growing body of data that suggests that atopic dermatitis does in fact makes individuals more susceptible these comorbidities, which some doctors refer to as the “atopic march.”

Vaseline petroleum jelly is one of the moisturizers recommended for the treatment of eczema by the National Eczema Association, though not as a prophylactic treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends petroleum jelly as one of the top choice moisturizers for treating (not necessarily preventing) eczema, including atopic dermatitis, because it’s among the most moisturizing.

Plus, it’s safe, Xu said. Petroleum jelly is fragrance-free and doesn’t have preservatives or additives that could potentially cause irritation or other allergies, he added. That said, some people may still avoid it for political or environmental reasons: Petroleum jelly is actually a byproduct of the oil refining process.

Sunflower seed oil was the second cheapest moisturizer in the study, costing $18.25 for six months of using it daily on a newborn, and may be a solid choice for those who want to avoid petroleum jelly.

Not all infants need a daily moisturizer

Ready to slather your infant with Vaseline tonight? Not without talking to your pediatrician first, Xu said.

It’s important to note that the initial study only included babies who were already considered high-risk of developing atopic dermatitis: They each had a parent or sibling who had at some point been diagnosed with eczema, asthma or hay fever.

Larger studies with longer follow-up are still needed ― and are currently ongoing ― to confirm that the method continues to prevent atopic dermatitis in babies who were moisturized beyond the first six months of their lives. But at this point, the data is encouraging, since nearly half of all individuals who develop eczema do so in the first year of their lives, Xu said.

So far, the research only suggests that using a daily moisturizer on newborns could be a good idea for babies at high risk. The risk of trying this intervention is low, even if it ultimately doesn’t prevent atopic dermatitis.

“Gentle, bland moisturizers have very little to no risk of harm to newborns,” Xu said, adding it’s definitely reasonable for parents with infants who are at high risk of developing atopic dermatitis to ask their pediatricians about using a moisturizer as a preventative measure.

The clothes go through a cycle: 1 - Goodwill Store. 2 - Goodwill outlet. 3 - Auction. 4 - Textile Recycler. #stopclickbait,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-does-goodwill-do-with-your-clothes_us_57e06b96e4b0071a6e092352?fbclid=IwAR03mMbwk3GGhB-_FtP3wTx5xtaZkgaV6MOYFFw4HogvCAshUSMau1yx-D0,"Education Images via Getty Images

Giving away used clothes may sound simple: You drop them off at a donation center, and then they’re sold to somebody who can re-use them. Right?

Not quite. In reality, donated clothing often takes a much longer journey before meeting its ultimate fate. In the end, it may get re-sold. But it also may end up in the trash, joining the approximately 12.8 million tons of American textile waste that was sent to landfills during 2013. And that benefits no one.

Goodwill is one of the biggest U.S. landing points for donated clothes: Stores in New York and New Jersey alone collected more than 85.7 million pounds of textile donations last year, Jose Medellin, director of communications for Goodwill NY/NJ, told HuffPost. And his Goodwill region is just one of 164 regional Goodwill organizations across the U.S. and Canada.

As you’re probably starting to realize, it takes a ton of effort to guide your clothes from the Goodwill donation bin to their final resting place. Knowing how Goodwill works can help you make smarter decisions when deciding if another jeans purchase is really worth it for you, for the donations staff and for the environment.

Step 1: The Goodwill retail store

Goodwill operates more than 3,200 individual stores, Kyle Stewart, director of donated goods retail, told HuffPost. When you donate a bag of clothing at a store, workers most likely parse through it to determine what can be sold and what can’t: Wet or mildew-y clothes are eliminated, but everything else is fair game.

Ray Tellez, the vice president of retail operations for Goodwill Southern California, said stores in his region track how long each piece of clothing has been on the retail floor. If an item doesn’t sell within four weeks, it’s sent onward in the process.

Step 2: A Goodwill outlet

At these stores, “the goal is to liquidate,” he told HuffPost. “We want to try and keep as much out of the landfill as possible.”

Each regional Goodwill organization may go about this process slightly differently. You can contact your regional Goodwill headquarters to learn more.

Step 3: Auction

Whatever isn’t sold in outlets moves on to Goodwill auctions, live events where attendees bid on bins of donated items without knowing precisely what’s inside. An auction bin might sell for as low as $35, which is a stellar value, according to Tellez.

Step 4: Textile Recyclers

Then comes the big move: If clothes weren’t able to sell in those first three stages of the process, Goodwill sends them to textile recycling organizations, Stewart said.

S.M.A.R.T., for example, is a trade association whose independent member businesses work to recycle textiles. On average, 45 percent of clothing that makes it to S.M.A.R.T. is either re-sold into the U.S. used clothing industry or sent overseas into markets with more demand, spokesperson Kathy Walsh told HuffPost.

But this isn’t necessarily a good thing. Obviously, re-selling clothes into the U.S. secondhand market just encourages them to make the cycle all over again. And sending clothes overseas can majorly hinder the textile industries in developing countries, robbing locals of jobs and income.

Beyond that, 30 percent of donated clothes at S.M.A.R.T. get cut into rags for industrial use, and 20 percent is processed into a soft fiber filling for furniture, home insulation, car sound-proofing and more.

But what about landfills?

If S.M.A.R.T. recyclers find clothes that are wet, moldy or contaminated, they send them to landfills, Walsh said. The amount they send is small ― just five percent of all donations ― but it all adds up to the ridiculous amount of clothing waste in landfills nationwide.

According to Walsh, nearly 95 percent of all clothing waste could be reused and recycled. We just aren’t disposing of it properly.

For starters, you should never, ever throw your clothes in the garbage, Medellin says. Instead, take them to a Goodwill or other donation center. If they’re wet, moldy or otherwise hazardous, then contact your city’s sanitation department and ask how best to dispose of them.

Of course, the easiest way to prevent clothing waste is to avoid buying clothes you don’t need. Keep a clean closet, and a cleaner planet will be waiting for you later.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this post stated that Americans sent 12 million pounds of textile waste to landfills in 2013. In fact, the number is much higher, at approximately 12.8 million tons.

If like myself you’re forever forgetting friends and families birthdays then we’ve got a hot tip for you, make a note of September 16.

Why? Well according to Harvard University September 16 is the most common birthday in the world, so if you’ve got that in the diary chances are you’ll be remembering someone’s birthday.

Advert 10

In fact according to FamousBirthdays.com you’ll be celebrating the birth of Nick Jonas, BB King, Amy Poehler and Flor Rida amongst many, many others. Who knows it may also be a friend’s birthday?

To work this out scientists made a graph, called a heat map, which corresponded to the number of births on any given day with light and dark squares.

The graph then shows how birthdays rank against each other, with darker sections being more common and lighter being rarer.

Advert 10

The reason for this is that unsurprisingly birth rates in the summer and autumn tend to be more popular for births, while people seem to conceive children in the winter, presumably to keep warm.

Meanwhile a separate study from back in 2013 which examined 6,500 sperm samples found that male fertility increases in the winter and spring months which again leads to a higher summer birth rate.

"Dishes can break easily, and the sinks show a lot of dirt and scratches. #stopclickbait",http://www.countryliving.com/home-design/a40747/farmhouse-sinks-problems/?fbclid=IwAR2RgkaRYRpcuUAh3OClfY8HvfBnQ0RgP0W0bI_wgtj8j0RZCgnMbuJOH0A,"Every country homeowner knows that no kitchen is complete without a farmhouse sink. They're both rustic and elegant, they provide plenty of room for washing dishes, and they're a Joanna Gaines must-have. But before you run off to install one, take note that they do come with a few complications.

Brittany Bailey, a North Carolina homeowner and the DIY guru behind the blog Pretty Handy Girl, is here to share the biggest problems she's experienced with her farmhouse sink, and her valid points are all factors to consider before getting one of your own. Here are both the problems (and the solutions!) you should know about.

1. You should expect some broken dishware. While accidents are bound to happen in any kitchen, you should anticipate a few more broken dishes than usual if you have a farmhouse sink, especially if it's made from cast iron, according to Brittany. They're designed to be extra durable and tough, which means they aren't very forgiving if you drop a glass or plate. The best solution for this is to invest in higher quality, ""break-resist"" dishes and glasses to avoid as many accidents as possible—or to simply be more cautious with your favorite pieces.

2. White sinks show much more dirt. While other sinks tend to mask grime and wear-and-tear, a white farmhouse sink is going to show it all. Be prepared to clean it more often, and opt for baking soda, which should make it look new again.

3. Scratches will be more noticeable too. If you love cooking with cast iron pans, then you should be even more cautious about this possible problem, Brittany writes. Over time, she's figured out the best way to clean up these scratch marks, which she shares onher blog. You can also opt for a sink grid to keep pots, pans, and other dirty items away from the bottom of your sink.

Toast the oats in butter before hand. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a39877/how-make-oatmeal-taste-better-toast-butter/?fbclid=IwAR1Ydf0XHHpeAMzpenYLJ2PkLoYtpmu_OZXwPTX6ilYY-Br7HK7O7vE3iIU,"No one wakes up in the morning craving oatmeal. You deal with the pile of mush when you're trying to be healthy. Breakfast doesn't have to be this sad. One quick and easy step will seriously change the way you think about oats.

Toast the oats in butter! It's a trick I picked up from the cookbook Whole Grain Mornings . While Megan, the author, has oatmeal down to a science, you don't need a recipe.

Melt a tab of butter in a small saucepan, then throw in the oats. The magic ratio is one tablespoon butter to one cup oats—steel cut or old-fashioned. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the oats smell nutty and roasted. Once you hit that point, set the oats aside and proceed as normal. Bring the milk or water (or a mixture of both) to a simmer, add the oats and cook to your liking.

The world of difference one tablespoon of butter makes is incredible. It makes oatmeal actually taste rich and decadent. You won't even need brown sugar or sweetener! It's amazing on its own.

Try it with these super-delish oatmeal recipes:

Clothes & Tide Pods. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/shopping/a38784/dollar-store-manager/?fbclid=IwAR1ZNW6uJJ9JW8EF25QnqtV-a03EzCOBjDV1Q-vy1gAIT4JgSU3Z2iVDP0c,"There seems to be an endless amount of curiosity surrounding dollar stores. And we get it—dollar stores are full of tremendous discounts you can't find anywhere else and helpful organization items (and yes, also some toxic products that scarred the bejeebers out of us!). But honestly, we've always wanted to know more. Like how is it possible to sell all those items so cheaply? And is that bargain-priced food actually safe to eat?

Well thanks to Brandon, a somewhat-secretive Dollar General manager and his recent Reddit post—where he did an ""ask me anything"" Q&A—we now know even more about the popular chains. Here's what we found most interesting about his insider information:

1. Dollar stores don't sell items that are faulty or broken—they're discounted for a different reason. ""I assume like any retailer the product is so cheap because it's bought in massive bulk quantities (DG has around 20,000 stores to supply),"" Brandon said. ""To be honest, most of the products that aren't food are made in China, so you can probably guess why it's cheap.""

2. But there's one precaution he recommends when buying food: ""It's always a good habit to check expiration dates in any store,"" he said, ""but you should be A-OK if the store team rotates the food.""

3. Yes, the stores are cheap, but the company is not. ""Normal starting pay for managers is 34-40k and is negotiable to some degree,"" Brandon explained. ""I'm in that range. I know another manager that's been with Dollar General for 15 years and gets paid 80k. Your pay depends on the size of the store you manage, location, and time with the company. You also get bonuses but I split those with my crew.""

4. And the company seems pretty strict. In fact, you can get fired on the spot for something seemingly harmless. When asked if he ever lost his keys, he replied, ""If you lose your keys you get fired instantly, so thankfully no.""

5. The unofficial biggest seller may (or may not) surprise you. ""The biggest steady seller for a single item would have to be cigarettes,"" he said, ""around 600 packs a week sold at my store.""

6. And the most shoplifted items are...odd. ""The two most shoplifted items is a tie between clothes and Tide Pods,"" the manager said. ""People were just slicing open the Tide Pod Pouches and dumping them into a bag. But I've seen a lot of stupid things get stolen like two packs [of] hot cocoa mix out of a box, a few trash bags out of a box, a few Ziploc bags out of a box that were only a dollar to begin with...tons more.""

7. Laundry products are considered the best deals, according to his customers. ""I get told laundry products. Beer is cheap too, same with phone chargers,"" he said when asked what the best dollar store deals are. ""We have iPhone 5 and 6 chargers for $15, while the stores down the street sell them for $30-40. Most of are our products are cheaper than other big box stores apparently (been told this by customers). Greeting cards are a deal. Most are 50¢-$1. If you go to a place like Hallmark they're about five bucks for the same ones.""

8. And other dollar stores aren't the main source of competition. ""Walmart markets are the competition and ever since four of them sprang up around my city, my district hasn't been breaking last year's sales,"" he explained.

Spray the top with vegetable oil and then cover it in plastic wrap. #stopclickbait,http://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a41502/this-is-how-you-can-stop-wasting-guacamole/?fbclid=IwAR16cnID2vyl2DBtXcKKqG7UNYHB-Mw04wBpwLBdegk0fYFUqLg8cO1a52E,"I was 21 the first time I tried the glorious green dip that is guacamole. And it was only then that I realized I had not been living for those first 21 years of life. I was simply existing. There is no need to debate, discuss, or dispute whether or not guacamole is God's gift to us mere Earthlings.

Anyway, like all great things in the world, the sanctity of guacamole comes at a cost. The stuff lasts only about 2 minutes in the refrigerator until it turns into a mushy brown vat of slime.

But, there is a cure, and you probably already have everything you need to make it work. The next time you make guac, just spray the top with some vegetable oil, coconut oil, or olive oil spray, then cover it in plastic wrap. It should stay green for up to 24 hours, according to PureWow.

Naturally, we had to know how this works—especially before greasing up our guac. Turns out, the spray creates an oxygen barrier around the mashed avocado, which eliminates any oxidation from occurring (the process that makes it turn brown). You could try this trick on sliced avocados too—perfect if you're only using half for a stuffed avocado or avo toast and want to save the other half for later.

This hack's a game changer—though, if you eat the entire bowl of guac in one sitting, you really never have to worry about this problem.

"Some benches are designed with handrails or as ""leaning"" benches as seen in the picture to prevent (homeless) people from sleeping on them. #stopclickbait",http://www.attn.com/stories/8266/public-benches-repel-homeless?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=internal&fbclid=IwAR3b3HJgI-ZI-gF3PuNKuXNBlKVvy03T5KMxlkYXGv0olHCn_LEssxZfrok,"Ever wonder why your city chooses to adorn its sidewalks and public parks with such ugly benches? It turns out that these structures aren't just offensive to the eyes.

Unsightly public architecture isn't always simply a product of bad taste — it can also serve as a means of social control and aims to repel local homeless populations, Atlas Obscura reported.

What makes architecture ""hostile""?

Known as hostile, defensive, or disciplinary architecture, these structures are strategically designed to deter homeless people and other groups perceived as undesirable from sleeping or loitering within eyesight of local residents.

""This style of architecture, which makes use of spikes, barricades, protrusions and checkpoints to prevent society’s unwanted from inhabiting public spaces, is not new,"" reporter Allegra Kirkland wrote on Alternet in 2015. ""But its forms are proliferating, and it can now be found in urban centers across the globe, from Tokyo to Copenhagen.""

This is what it looks like.

In 2014, a luxury apartment building in London installed “anti-homeless” spikes in a nearby alcove.

""People living in the flats, which sell for upwards of £800,000, said the metal studs were installed two weeks ago after a number of homeless people were seen sleeping there,"" the Telegraph reported in June 2014.

The spikes led to major backlash on social media, and they were ultimately removed.

Hostile architecture isn't always easy to spot.

Hostile architecture also pops up in more subtle forms — like public benches.

Often, defensive architecture is said to be installed for security purposes, but our definitions of safe and secure housing are colored by the stigma and criminalization of homelessness. ""This style of design cannot be untethered from broader anti-vagrancy efforts, particularly in the United States,"" Alternet reported.

""We see these measures all the time within our urban environments, whether in London or Tokyo, but we fail to process their true intent,"" writer Alex Andreou wrote on the Guardian. ""I hardly noticed them before I became homeless in 2009.""

""It was only then that I started scanning my surroundings with the distinct purpose of finding shelter and the city’s barbed cruelty became clear,"" he continued.

Andreou described what happened when he discovered an old wooden bench had been replaced with a more hostile design:

""An old, wooden bench, made concave and smooth by thousands of buttocks, underneath a sycamore with foliage so thick that only the most persistent rain could penetrate it. Sheltered and warm, perched as it was against a wall behind which a generator of some sort radiated heat, this was prime property. Then, one morning, it was gone. In its place stood a convex metal perch, with three solid armrests. I felt such loss that day.""

Not all hostile architecture is ugly, either. It can even come in the form of a pretty plant, placed somewhere homeless people might otherwise sleep or rest.

""Hostile design comes in even more innocuous, and sometimes even lovely forms,"" Atlas Obscura pointed out. ""Take the humble potted plant. What could be hostile about a leafy ficus in a pretty pot? Nothing—until you consider where it's placed.""

Hostile architecture attempts to conceal poverty and homelessness, which are already criminalized in many U.S. cities.

There are already many laws that criminalize homelessness in the U.S., as Alternet activism editor Alyssa Figueroa pointed out in a February 2015 piece. These laws restrict homeless individuals from activities like resting, begging, sharing food, and urinating in public.

""Hostile architecture facilitates the work of law enforcement by making it physically impossible for the homeless to inhabit public spaces,"" Kirkland observed on Alternet. ""Neither approach actually addresses the root causes of homelessness, but instead shoves it out of sight.""

They put sunblock on their eyes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/space/some-people-didnt-quite-understand-what-watch-safely-meant-during-the-eclipse/,"The Great American Eclipse was a wonderful, perhaps once-in-a-lifetime, opportunity to see the gorgeous cosmic ballet in action. It also seemed to provoke plenty of people up and down the country to do something rather stupid: look at the Sun during the eclipse without any protective glasses on at all.

Although the most famous person to ignore the advice of essentially every scientist and journalist on the planet was the President of the United States, spikes in Google searches for terms like “I looked at the Sun” and “eclipse headache” reveal that he wasn’t alone in this endeavor.

Somehow, though, things get stranger still. As reported by WCYB, a local news station in Virginia, some people were apparently putting sunscreen in their eyes so that they could “safely” look at the eclipse.

Nurse Practioner Trish Patterson told WCYB’s sister station, KRCR, that although she hasn’t seen any patients coming in with eclipse-related ocular damage, she has seen a few people come in after dousing their peep holes in a product that is quite clearly just meant to adorn the skin.

As you might have guessed, sunscreen in the eye doesn’t have the same effect as a lens specifically designed to filter out most wavelengths of light. Too little sunscreen and it’ll burn a little as it oozes around the white sclera of your eyeball. Too much, and you just wouldn’t be able to see anything anyway.

Either way, it’d cause you to cry a lot, which only seems appropriate during an eclipse if you’re overcome with emotion.

You can see where these unfortunate few hospital patients were coming from when they decided to squeeze some SPF 20 unguent into their eyes, but this course of action was about as useful and as sensible as using nail varnish on your tongue, or injecting shampoo into your nostrils. Do not do these things.

Maybe eclipses just bring out the oddest behaviors in people. Plenty thought it was a sign of the apocalypse, if Google Trends is anything to go by. One radio host suggested that the highly predictable astronomical event was actually the work of the Prince of Darkness.

The risk from artificial intelligence. ,http://www.iflscience.com/technology/elon-musk-warns-theres-something-we-should-be-more-worried-about-than-north-korea/,"Elon Musk recently tweeted that we may be more at risk from artificial intelligence (AI) than the current nuclear threat by North Korea.

Clearly concerned with the increasing advancement in technology, Musk took to Twitter to voice his fears and deliver a warning to developers, and possible regulators of the industry.

""If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea,"" he wrote.

This comes at a time of increasing tension between North Korea and the USA, in which the threat of nuclear weapons is becoming more and more real with each day. Despite this, Musk believes our greatest threat lies currently in the virtually unregulated AI industry, and as such is now calling for improvements to be made.

-

He followed on from his previous tweet by stating ""everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too.""

Admittedly, AI technology is developing rapidly. OpenAI, a company led by Musk, recently succeeded in reaching a huge milestone in AI progress – an AI bot consistently beat professional human opponents in 1v1 scenarios in the popular video game Dota. This is particularly impressive, as the bot learned how to win solely by repeatedly playing against itself over a period of three months. With minimal human coaching, it was able to learn complex mechanics, alongside exploiting its opponent’s mistakes and adapting to random play styles – achievements far more advanced than the board games tested previously.

This occurred on August 12 at the Grand Finals of The International 7, the largest annual Dota tournament, with a staggering prize pool of nearly $25million and the victory of being watched by nearly 4.7million people.

Whether this game off was for entertainment purposes, or to show the power and speed of progression of current AI technology, we're not sure, but the bot certainly made an impression.

Whilst the warning appears worrying, don’t start running to find a cave to live in just yet, it isn’t the first time Musk has predicted danger from AIs. In 2014, he tweeted:

-

Clearly he hasn’t changed his mind since then, and is still fighting to get across the importance of the issue.

Perhaps with this demonstration, and the rate at which AIs are growing in intelligence, it really is time to begin regulating the industry and collaborating between developers to understand AIs better. After all, if they are actually more dangerous than nukes, we’re going to need all the help we can get.",Elon Musk Warns There's Something We Should Be More Worried About Than North Korea

Kitchen sponge. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/kitchen-sponges-hoard-more-bacteria-than-anywhere-else-in-the-house/,"If you're curious where most of the bacteria lurks in your house, wonder no longer. Kitchen sponges are now the undisputed leaders of bacteria stockpiling.

The research, published in Scientific Reports, looked at the microbial diversity of building environments. Unsurprisingly, they found that a kitchen sponge is a good place for bacteria – after all, it tends to remain rich in water and come into contact with food – but most of us don't know just how much bacteria. Sponges show a local density of 54 billion bacterial cells per cubic centimeter. That is equivalent to the number of bacteria estimated to be in human feces.

“Despite common misconception, it was demonstrated that kitchen environments host more microbes than toilets,” the researchers wrote in the study. “This was mainly due to the contribution of kitchen sponges which were proven to represent the biggest reservoirs of active bacteria in the whole house”

Not only are sponges full of bacteria, they also spread bacteria all around the kitchen when we clean with them. While this might seem utterly disgusting, it’s important to realize that bacteria are everywhere. We have just as many bacterial cells in our body as we have human cells, for example. The focus needs to be on how many dangerous bacteria the sponges harbor.

For this reason, the team produced the first comprehensive analysis of the bacterial microbiome of sponges. They discovered that the most abundant type of bacteria belongs to the Moraxellaceae family, averaging 36 percent across the sample. Moraxellaceae represents the typical human skin bacteria, so we bring them to the sponge, where they multiply and can become potentially dangerous. Most of the bacteria they found was not dangerous, although some were.

""What surprised us was that five of the ten [types] which we most commonly found, belong to the so-called risk group 2 (RG2),"" said lead researcher, microbiologist Markus Egert in a statement, ""which means they are potential pathogens.""

The main three were Acinetobacter johnsonii, Moraxella osloensis, and Chryseobacterium hominis.

The study also looked at how to avoid an overbundance of this bacteria. “Sanitation by boiling or microwave treatment has been shown to significantly reduce the bacterial load of kitchen sponges and can, therefore, be regarded as a reasonable hygiene measure. However, our data showed that regularly sanitized sponges (as indicated by their users) did not contain less bacteria than uncleaned ones.”

The cleaning procedures actually changed the microbiome – and not exactly for the better. Moraxellaceae and Chryseobacterium hominis appeared to increase in number, as they are more resistant than competing bacteria. This suggests that prolonged sanitation of kitchen sponges might have counterproductive effects. The researchers think that to reduce risk, the best option is to replace the sponges regularly.",A New Study Has Determined The Most Germ-Laden Object In Your Home
"Wind and associated pressure waves would flatten everything, including you. #StopClickbait",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/3/15903154/asteroid-death-one-chart,"The chances of dying via an asteroid impact are very, very small.

Asteroids that pose an existential threat to life on Earth only strike once every 500,000 years or more. Even the 140-meter-wide asteroids that could destroy cities and regions rain down death once every 10,000 years. (Though, to note: One of this approximate size just sailed past the Earth, coming within 45,000 miles of our planet, to the surprise of scientists who didn’t see it coming.)

The risk of being even injured from a 20-meter object — like the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 and hurt nearly 1,500 people — is tiny.

But, okay: WHAT IF? If a huge asteroid were to smash into Earth, what would happen to us? We all know Hollywood’s take: Either we’ll be engulfed by a huge fireball or swallowed by a massive tsunami.

The journal Geophysical Research Letters in 2017 published an analysis of the likely source of casualties from an asteroid impact. In it, the scientists ran a computer model where they simulated the impact of 50,000 asteroids — from the very tiny to 400-meter monsters — all over the globe. They estimated how each of the asteroids would create chaos (i.e., if they hit in water, they’d perhaps create a tsunami, if they hit land, they would generate debris and a shockwave), and estimated the causalities of each of the impacts based on the population density in the area.

In sum, here’s what they found: If you’re going to die via an asteroid, it will be the wind and shockwave that gets you.

Surprisingly ""effects such as cratering, seismic shaking and ejecta deposition [i.e., ejected debris] provide only a minor contribution to overall loss,"" the study concluded. If Asteroid 2019 OK — the name of the one that just made a near-miss of the Earth — collided with our planet, most people in the impact area (poor souls) would have died due to wind.

Why wind? It’s because if a large-enough asteroid explodes in the air before hitting the Earth (and generating tsunamis, craters, and fire-filled torrents of death), the resulting shockwave could blast winds powerful enough to flatten cities. The pressure from the blast could rupture internal organs. Bottom line: An asteroid doesn’t have to reach the ground intact to cause chaos. In their analysis, 60 percent of all asteroid deaths were caused by wind and pressure.

The chart above shows that as the asteroids get larger, your chances of dying of anything other than wind increase, but the wind would still the No. 1 cause of death.

Tsunamis aren’t as much of a factor, relatively speaking, because in many areas, the geography of the shoreline would dampen their destructive reach, New Scientist explains in its report on the study. Also: Wind is a factor in every asteroid collision, and tsunamis are only implicated in impacts over water.

So, should this graphic keep you up at night? No.

Talking about the risk of asteroid impact is tricky. We’re not likely to see a huge destructive asteroid in our lifetimes. Those threaten future generations. “You have to think about the risk in terms of it’s not a risk to a person or a city, but a risk to humanity,” said Eric Christensen, who hunts asteroids for NASA at the Catalina Sky Survey.

Small asteroid strikes are much more likely. But for one to land near you would be an incredible stroke of bad luck.

“One of the most remarkable things about the Chelyabinsk impactor for me was that it happened over a populated area,” Christensen says. “Ninety-eight percent of the planet is unpopulated or very sparsely populated.”

And that’s why NASA’s tracking these baddies now. The more we keep an eye on them, the more we can devise engineering solutions to push a deadly asteroid off a collision course. The Center for Near Earth Object Studies at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory has logged around 18,000 asteroids that come close to Earth’s orbital neighborhood. And there are thousands more to find.

How NASA hunts for asteroids, explained: To date, the center has tagged 16,000 asteroids, comets, and bits of space debris that orbit in the neighborhood around Earth. Here’s how.","If you die via asteroid, this is how it will happen"
"The article doesn't actually say it outright, but it is suggesting every 1-2 weeks. .",http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/how-often-you-should-wash-your-bed-sheets-according-to-a-microbiologist-and-what-happens-when-you-dont/,"We spend more than a third of our lives in bed — but that place can quickly blossom into a ""botanical park"" of bacteria and fungus, according to New York University microbiologist Philip Tierno.

If left for too long, the microscopic life within the wrinkles and folds of our bed sheets can even make us sick, Tierno told Business Insider.

To stem the invisible tide, he said, sheets should be washed once a week.

Humans naturally produce roughly 26 gallons of sweat in bed every year. When it's hot and humid outside, this moisture becomes what scientists call an ""ideal fungal culture medium.""

In a recent study that assessed the level of fungal contamination in bedding, researchers found that a test sample of feather and synthetic pillows that were 1 1/2 to 20 years old contained as many as 16 species of fungus each.

And it's not just your own microbial life you're sleeping with. In addition to the fungi and bacteria that come from your sweat, sputum, skin cells, and vaginal and anal excretions, you also share your bed with foreign microbes. These include animal dander, pollen, soil, lint, dust mite debris and feces, and finishing agents from whatever your sheets are made from, to name a few.

Tierno says all that gunk becomes ""significant"" in as little as a week. And unclean bedding still exposes you to materials that can trigger the sniffing and sneezing, since the microbes are so close to your mouth and nose that you're almost forced to breathe them in.

""Even if you don't have allergies per se, you can have an allergic response,"" Tierno said.

Another reason your sheets get dirty quickly has little to do with your behavior or sweat patterns — the issue is simply gravity.

""Just like Rome over time was buried with the debris that falls from gravity, gravity is what brings all that material into your mattress,"" Tierno said.

One to two weeks of this buildup is enough to leave anyone with a scratchy throat — especially those with significant allergies or asthma. (One in six Americans has allergies.)

""If you touched dog poo in the street, you'd want to wash your hands,"" Tierno said. ""Consider that analogous to your bedding. If you saw what was there — but of course you don't see it — after a while you have to say to yourself, 'Do I want to sleep in that?'""

I’m not trying to provoke panic about watching the solar eclipse. Hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions — of people across the United States are going to walk outside Aug. 21, look up, and see something truly spectacular. That’s something I look forward to.

But because I’m curious (and quite a few people have asked), I thought it would be interesting to talk about what would happen if you tried to look at the sun during the eclipse. And don’t tell me it doesn’t happen and people know better. That’s not true.

According to an expert answer on the University of California at Santa Barbara ScienceLine, ” … doctors collect information after events like the 1999 solar eclipse, when people who stared directly at the sun for several minutes went to see their doctor. In one study, about half had permanent damage.”

An assessment after the same eclipse in Britain found fewer cases than they had feared, but 14 people still managed to damage their eyes by staring at the eclipse.

There’s even a tale that Isaac Newton stared at the sun with one eye (for the sake of science, of course), and afterward he could only see reds and blues. I have no idea if that is fiction or fact, but it sure makes a good story.

Want to watch the eclipse safely? Here’s how it will go …

… if you’re in the path of totality:

It will start as a partial eclipse as the moon begins to cover the sun. Keep your glasses on at this point.

When the sun is totally blocked by the moon, you can take your glasses off! Enjoy. It’s beautiful.

Story continues below advertisement

Once sunlight starts to appear again, as the moon departs, put your glasses back on and enjoy the partial eclipse.

… if you’re not in the path of totality:

You’ll only be seeing a partial eclipse. There will be harmful sun rays for the duration of the event. Keep your eclipse glasses on through the whole thing.

Yes, you will go blind if you manage to endure the pain and stare at the sun for long enough. The pain from the visible part of the light spectrum could be extreme, but ultraviolet light — which we can’t see — can also damage the eye. It literally gives your eye a sunburn.

The reason a few people always end up going blind during an eclipse is that in the partial phase, the visible light is reduced enough that it’s no longer painful or uncomfortable to look at and so people assume it’s safe. But depending on the sky conditions, it only takes about a minute and a half for your eyes to be permanently damaged, and the damage is cumulative, meaning you don’t have to stare at the sun without looking away for it to be harmful — you may just be taking quick glances, but it’s still damaging your eye.

If your eyes are damaged, your vision will at least be blurry and you may see dark or yellow spots. If it’s significant damage, you may not be able to see out of the center of your eye — only your peripheral vision.

Other things you should be aware of: Some drugs dilate your pupils, which will decrease the amount of time it will take to burn the eye. People taking these drugs should always take care to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Also, looking through a camera lens or a telescope will not protect your eyes. The latter is blatantly obvious in the video. Unless it has a filter on it that is made specifically for blocking out the harmful rays, you should not look through any lenses.",Here’s what happened to people who tried to watch a solar eclipse without special glasses
Far less than 0.01% increase in cancer risk (for the average flyer). ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/air-travel-exposes-you-to-radiation-how-much-health-risk-comes-with-it/all/,"This past April, business traveler Tom Stuker became the world’s most frequent flyer, logging 18,000,000 miles of air travel on United Airlines over the last 14 years.

That’s a lot of time up in the air. If Stuker’s traveling behaviors are typical of other business flyers, he may have eaten 6,500 inflight meals, drunk 5,250 alcoholic beverages, watched thousands of inflight movies and made around 10,000 visits to airplane toilets.

He would also have accumulated a radiation dose equivalent to about 1,000 chest x-rays. But what kind of health risk does all that radiation actually pose?

Cosmic rays coming at you

You might guess that a frequent flyer’s radiation dose is coming from the airport security checkpoints, with their whole-body scanners and baggage x-ray machines, but you’d be wrong. The radiation doses to passengers from these security procedures are trivial.

The major source of radiation exposure from air travel comes from the flight itself. This is because at high altitude the air gets thinner. The farther you go from the Earth’s surface, the fewer molecules of gas there are per volume of space. Thinner air thus means fewer molecules to deflect incoming cosmic rays – radiation from outer space. With less atmospheric shielding, there is more exposure to radiation.

The most extreme situation is for astronauts who travel entirely outside of the Earth’s atmosphere and enjoy none of its protective shielding. Consequently, they receive high radiation doses. In fact, it is the accumulation of radiation dose that is the limiting factor for the maximum length of manned space flights. Too long in space and astronauts risk cataracts, cancer and potential heart ailments when they get back home.

Indeed, it’s the radiation dose problem that is a major spoiler for Elon Musk’s goal of inhabiting Mars. An extended stay on Mars, with its extremely thin atmosphere, would be lethal due to the high radiation doses, notwithstanding Matt Damon’s successful Mars colonization in the movie “The Martian.”

Radiation risks of ultra frequent flying

What would be Stuker’s cumulative radiation dose and what are his health risks?

It depends entirely on how much time he has spent in the air. Assuming an average flight speed (550 mph), Stuker’s 18,000,000 miles would translate into 32,727 hours (3.7 years) of flight time. The radiation dose rate at typical commercial airline flight altitude (35,000 feet) is about 0.003 millisieverts per hour. (As I explain in my book “Strange Glow: The Story of Radiation,” a millisievert or mSv is a unit of radiation dose that can be used to estimate cancer risk.) By multiplying the dose rate by the hours of flight time, we can see that Stuker has earned himself about 100 mSv of radiation dose, in addition to a lot of free airline tickets. But what does that mean for his health?

The primary health threat at this dose level is an increased risk of some type of cancer later in life. Studies of atomic bomb victims, nuclear workers and medical radiation patients have allowed scientists to estimate the cancer risk for any particular radiation dose.

All else being equal and assuming that low doses have risk levels proportionate to high doses, then an overall cancer risk rate of 0.005 percent per mSv is a reasonable and commonly used estimate. Thus, Stuker’s 100-mSv dose would increase his lifetime risk of contracting a potentially fatal cancer by about 0.5 percent.

Contextualizing the risk

The question then becomes whether that’s a high level of risk. Your own feeling might depend on how you see your background cancer risk.

Most people underestimate their personal risk of dying from cancer. Although the exact number is debatable, it’s fair to say that about 25 percent of men ultimately contract a potentially fatal cancer. Stuker’s 0.5 percent cancer risk from radiation should be added to his baseline risk – so it would go from 25 percent to 25.5 percent. A cancer risk increase of that size is too small to actually measure in any scientific way, so it must remain a theoretical increase in risk.

A 0.5 percent increase in risk is the same as one chance in 200 of getting cancer. In other words, if 200 male travelers logged 18,000,000 miles of air travel, like Stuker did, we might expect just one of them to contract a cancer thanks to his flight time. The other 199 travelers would suffer no health effects. So the chances that Stuker is the specific 18-million-mile traveler who would be so unlucky is quite small.

Stuker was logging more air hours per year (greater than 2,000) than most pilots typically log (under 1,000). So these airline workers would have risk levels proportionately lower than Stuker’s. But what about you?

If you want to know your personal cancer risk from flying, estimate all of your commercial airline miles over the years. Assuming that the values and parameters for speed, radiation dose and risk stated above for Stuker are also true for you, dividing your total miles by 3,700,000,000 will give your approximate odds of getting cancer from your flying time.

For example, let’s pretend that you have a mathematically convenient 370,000 total flying miles. That would mean 370,000 miles divided by 3,700,000,000, which comes out to be 1/10,000 odds of contracting cancer (or a 0.01 percent increase in risk). Most people do not fly 370,000 miles (equal to 150 flights from Los Angeles to New York) within their lifetimes. So for the average flyer, the increased risk is far less than 0.01 percent.

To make your exercise complete, make a list of all the benefits that you’ve derived from your air travel over your lifetime (job opportunities, vacation travel, family visits and so on) and go back and look at your increased cancer risk again. If you think your benefits have been meager compared to your elevated cancer risk, maybe its time to rethink flying. But for many people today, flying is a necessity of life, and the small elevated cancer risk is worth the price.

Yes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/is-it-ok-to-run-in-heat-of-30-or-more/,"Most of Britain is experiencing a heatwave, with temperatures reaching up to 32℃. The public health watchdog for England has issued an amber health warning, advising people to take care in the hotter weather. But what does it mean for runners? Is it ever too hot to go for a run?

With the recent high temperatures in parts of the UK soaring above 30℃, people may find themselves questioning the safety of running in the heat. Running in hotter temperatures though is not uncommon, with many runners competing in warmer climates such as Kenya, Ethiopia and Japan, where temperatures average 25℃.

But while running in the heat may be considered a risk to some people – such as children, the elderly and pregnant women – as long as precautions are taken, running in temperatures as high as 30-35℃ is fine.

A number of running events take place in extreme heat (over 35℃), such as Badwater, the 135-mile ultra-marathon that takes place in Death Valley, California, where temperatures can sore to over 50℃. There is also the annual Marathon des Sables, a five-day run across the Sahara Desert in Morocco, where temperatures can reach 50℃. This 156-mile run is considered the toughest foot race on Earth. Our experience at Kingston University with people running and training in our heat chamber for events such as the Marathon des Sables and Badwater, demonstrates that with enough preparation, hydration and being sensible about how hard you run, it is possible to run safely in high temperatures. But it is important to note, that these races do take a lot of preparation and acclimatisation and running in such temperatures is certainly not recommended without thorough training.",Is It OK To Run In Heat Of 30℃ Or More?
"1. Your body is more likely to become inflamed as you get older.

2. You drink less water when you're older.

3. Your body isn't as efficient at detoxifying.

",http://www.thisisinsider.com/do-hangovers-get-worse-with-age-why-2017-3,"The INSIDER Summary:

According to Dr. Ralph Holsworth, hangovers do get worse with age.

There are three reasons for this.

Your body is more likely to become inflamed when you're older, you drink less water when you're older, and your body isn't as efficient at detoxifying.



Ever wondered why you can't drink the way you used to in college?

Turns out there's actual science to back up why you feel hungover after two beers when you used to be able to handle five.

According to Dr. Ralph Holsworth, an osteopathic family medicine physician and director of clinical and scientific research for Essentia Water, hangovers do unfortunately worsen with age.

Dr. Holsworth attributes that to three main reasons.

Your body is more likely to become inflamed when you're older.

As you get older, your body goes into what Dr. Holsworth refers to as a ""pro-inflammatory state."" What he means by that is your body is more likely to become inflamed.

Inflammation is what happens to your body when it's trying to fight off an infection or heal itself in some way. When you drink, your body identifies the alcohol you consume as a chemical toxin, which then causes inflammation throughout the body.

Although inflammation is technically a good thing because it means you're healing, it's not a comfortable state for your body to be in. It often causes pain and swelling, and is partly to blame for your hangover symptoms. And because your body is more likely to become inflamed the older you get, the discomfort you feel due to a hangover will only increase with age.

You drink less water the older you get.

According to Dr. Holsworth, your body's ""thirst drive,"" or its cues to drink water, decrease with age. Alcohol already dehydrates you — which then causes you to feel like death the next day — so if you start out a night of drinking without being properly hydrated, your hangover symptoms are only going to be worse the next day.

Your body becomes less efficient at detoxifying as you get older.

Your body identifies alcohol as a toxin. So processing the alcohol you drink involves a complex method of detoxification. The liver is crucial in this process, and according to Dr. Holsworth, liver function decreases with age.

That means that when you're older, your liver just doesn't work as efficiently as it used to. Because of that, it becomes harder for your body to process alcohol.",Here's why your hangovers get worse as you get older

To conserve energy. ,http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/why-flamingos-stand-on-one-leg/,"The reason it looks so easy is because, for them, it is. Natalia Barsukova/Shutterstock

Flamingos are basically the models of the animal kingdom. They’re tall, slim, a fabulous color, and know how to strike a pose.

Now, scientists think they have unraveled the mysteries of why and how the feathery pink wonders assume this iconic position: It turns out flamingos can conserve more energy standing on one leg than two.

Researchers from the US discovered that flamingos’ legs have a mechanism that fixes into place when their legs are straight, meaning they don’t actually expend any muscular activity once they're in place.

Professor Young-Hui Chang of Georgia Institute of Technology and Dr Lena H Ting of Emory University, Atlanta, suspected that the birds’ legs might feature a characteristic that meant their joints could lock into place, but when they studied two donated cadavers from Birmingham Zoo, they couldn't find anything.

However, when Chang picked the bird up by its leg and held it upright, the leg fixed into place, became rigid and held.

“That was the ‘Aha!’ moment when we knew we were on to something special,” Chang told Discover. “If a dead flamingo could do it, then it is probably available for live birds to do.”

Strangely, they found the dead flamingos could not hold the pose when they tried to stand them up on two legs, which led them to suspect it takes more effort for the birds’ muscles to use two legs than just one.

They then studied the balance behaviors of eight live juvenile flamingos from Zoo Atlanta by placing them on a force-plate, basically fancy bathroom scales, and waiting for them to fall asleep. They discovered that when the flamingos were less active, they swayed less on one leg. In fact, when they fell asleep, their postural sway was seven times lower than when they were active.

Their results, published in the journal Biology letters, suggest that the flamingos rely on a passive mechanism for support, not an active one that uses muscular effort.

This seems counterintuitive because as humans we typically think standing on one leg and remaining balanced is rather difficult, requiring a lot of energy, control, and effort. However, as flamingos use their legs more for prolonged standing than running around, for them it is much more energy efficient.

Though the researchers say they need to do further tests to understand the mechanism better, their study could have many practical applications. It could explain why other birds, such as herons and storks, often do the same thing, as well as have an influence on the development of many-legged robots and prosthetic limbs in the future.

Vehicles will not protect you from the nuclear fallout. ,http://www.thisisinsider.com/survive-nuclear-attack-fallout-shelter-cars-2017-5?utm_content=buffere5967&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer,"Nuclear blasts create fallout, which can harm you with large doses of radiation.

Cars offer little protection from fallout.

A surer way to survive in the aftermath of a nuclear explosion is to go indoors, stay put, and listen to the radio.

The first thing you'd see if a nuclear bomb exploded nearby is a flood of light so bright, you may think the sun blew up.

Wincing from temporary blindness, you'd scan the horizon and see an orange fireball. The gurgling flames would rise and darken into purple-hued column of black smoke, which would turn in on itself. As a toadstool-like mushroom took shape, the deafening shock front of the blast would rip through the area — and possibly knock you off your feet.

Congratulations! In this hypothetical scenario, you've just survived a nuclear blast with an energy output of about 10 kilotons (20 million pounds) of TNT. That's roughly 66% of energy released by either atom bomb dropped on Japan in 1945.

The fireball of a nuclear explosion. Public domain

This scenario may sound far-fetched, but more than 14,900 nuclear weapons exist in the world, and kiloton-class nukes (like the one we just described) are now proliferating in weapons stockpiles. In fact, a 10-kiloton-or-less nuclear detonation by a terrorist is the first of 15 disaster scenarios that the US government has planned for

No one could fault you for panicking after the sight and roar of a nuclear blast. But there is one thing you should never do, according to Brooke Buddemeier, a health physicist and radiation expert at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

""Don't get in your car,"" he tells Business Insider — don't try to drive, and don't assume that the glass and metal of a vehicle can protect you.

Why vehicles and nuclear survival don't mix

A nuclear blast vaporizes the paint off of a car. Public domain

Avoiding driving after a nuclear blast is wise because streets would probably be full of erratic drivers, accidents, and debris. But Buddemeier says there's another important reason to ditch the car: a fearsome after-effect of nuclear blasts called fallout.

Fallout is a complex mixture of fission products, or radioisotopes, that are created by splitting atoms. Many of the fission products decay rapidly and emit gamma radiation, an invisible yet highly energetic form of light. Exposure to too much of this radiation in a short time can damage the body's cells and its ability to fix itself — a condition called acute radiation sickness.

""It also affects the immune system and the your ability to fight infections,"" Buddemeier says.

Only very dense and thick materials, like many feet of dirt or inches of lead, can reliably stop the fallout.

""The fireball from a 10-kiloton explosion is so hot, it actually shoots up into the atmosphere at over 100 miles per hour,"" Buddemeier says. ""These fission products mix in with the dirt and debris that's drawn up into the atmosphere from the fireball.""

Trapped in sand, dirt, cement, metal, and anything else in the immediate blast area, the gamma-shooting fission products can fly more than five miles into the air. The larger pieces drop back down, while lighter particles can be carried by the wind before raining over distant areas.

""Close in to the [blast] site, they may be a bit larger than golf-ball-size, but really what we're talking about are things like salt- or sand-size particles,"" Buddemeier says. ""It's the penetrating gamma radiation coming off of those particles that's the hazard.""

Which brings us back to why a car is a terrible place to take shelter.

""Modern vehicles are made of glass and very light metals, and they offer almost no protection,"" he says. ""You're just going to sit on a road some place [and be exposed].""

Buddemeier says he's asked people what their knee-jerk response to a nuclear blast might be. It wasn't comforting.

""There was actually a lot of folks who had this notion — and it may be a Hollywood notion — of 'oh, jump in the car and try to skedaddle out of town if you see a mushroom cloud.'"" he says.

However, fallout is carried by high-altitude winds that are ""often booking along at 100 miles per hour,"" he says, and ""often not going in the same direction as the ground-level winds. So your ability to know where the fallout's gonna go, and outrun it, are… Well, it's very unlikely.""

What you should do instead of driving

The protection factor that various buildings, and locations within them, offer from the radioactive fallout of a nuclear blast. The higher the number, the greater the protection. Brooke Buddemeier/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

Your best shot at survival after a nuclear disaster is to get into some sort of ""robust structure"" as quickly as possible and stay there, Buddemeier says. He's a fan of the mantra ""go in, stay in, tune in"".

""Get inside ... and get to the center of that building. If you happen to have access to below-ground areas, getting below-ground is great,"" he says. ""Stay in: 12 to 24 hours.""

The reason to wait is that levels of gamma and other radiation fall off exponentially after a nuclear blast as ""hot"" radioisotopes decay into more stable atoms and pose less of a danger. This slowly shrinks the dangerous fallout zone — the area where high-altitude winds have dropped fission products. (Instead of staying put, however, a recent study also suggested that moving to a stronger shelter or basement may not be a bad idea if you first ducked into a flimsy one.)

The dangerous fallout zone (dark purple) shrinks quickly, while the much less dangerous hot zone (faint purple) grows for about 24 hours before shrinking back. Brooke Buddemeier/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

Finally, tune in.

""Try to use whatever communication tools you have,"" he says. He added that a hand-cranked radio is a good object to keep at work and home, since emergency providers, in addition to broadcasting instructions, will be tracking the fallout cloud and trying to broadcast where any safe corridors for escape are located.

There is only one exception to the ""no cars"" rule, says Buddemeier: If you're in a parking garage with your car, the concrete might act as a shield. In that case, you could stay there and listen to a radio inside your car.

If everyone followed these guidelines after nuclear blast, he says, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved.","If a nuclear bomb explodes nearby, here's why you should never, ever get in a car"
Strawberries. ,https://www.aol.com/article/lifestyle/2017/03/21/strawberries-pesticides/21904539/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00001392,"Just because it's fruit, doesn't mean it's healthy.

Every year, over 3 billion pounds of strawberries are produced by the United States, constituting a nearly 3 billion dollar business. California is responsible for producing over 90% of the strawberry crop in America, while Florida grows the second most amount. While experts believe the production and consumption of strawberries will continue to grow each year, many are warning of its dangers.

Once again, strawberries have topped the ""Dirty Dozen"" list -- they are hailed as the fruit ""most likely to be contaminated with pesticide residues even after they are picked, rinsed in the field and washed before eating"", according to the Environmental Working Group (EWG). Other produce listed includes spinach, nectarines, apples and potatoes.

How to store every single type of fruit:

The takeaways from the EWG are quite apparent.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture found that strawberries contained nearly 8 pesticides per sample. That's more than any other sample of produce, which contained 2.3 pesticides per sample, in comparison. Scientists found that nearly 30% of strawberries had residues of more than 10 pesticides, with the ""dirtiest"" linked to 21 different pesticides.

If that doesn't deter you enough to eat organic strawberries, scientists found traces of poisonous gas on strawberries as well. These included mostly Carbendazim and Bifenthrin, which was found on 33% of the strawberry samples. These harmful chemicals have been associated with a variety of health issues, including cancer, developmental and reproductive damage, and neurological problems.

In light of this report, nutritionists are advising their clients to ""shop smart"".

""I believe that this is an important source of information,"" said Corinne Bush to CNN. Consequently, the EWG says that buyers should look for organic produce.

""Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables is essential no matter how they're grown, but for the items with the heaviest pesticide loads, we urge shoppers to buy organic. If you can't buy organic, the Shopper's Guide will steer you to conventionally grown produce that is the lowest in pesticides,"" said EWG analyst Sonya Lunder.

Aerobic exercise done for at least 45 minutes at a time. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-the-single-best-type-of-exercise-for-your-brain-according-to-scientists,"Want an all-natural way to lift your mood, improve your memory, and protect your brain against age-related cognitive decline? Get moving.

A wealth of recent research, including two new studies published this spring, suggests that any type of exercise that raises your heart rate and gets you moving and sweating for a sustained period of time - known as aerobic exercise - has a significant, overwhelmingly beneficial impact on the brain.

""Aerobic exercise is the key for your head, just as it is for your heart,"" write the authors of a recent article in the Harvard Medical School blog, Mind and Mood.

While some of the benefits, like a lift in mood, can emerge as soon as a few minutes into a sweaty bike ride, others, like improved memory, might take several weeks to crop up.

That means that the best type of fitness for your mind is any aerobic exercise that you can do regularly and consistently for at least 45 minutes at a time.

Depending on which benefits you're looking for, you might try adding a brisk walk or a jog to your daily routine. A pilot study in people with severe depression found that just 30 minutes of treadmill walking for 10 consecutive days was ""sufficient to produce a clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in depression.""

Aerobic workouts can also help people who aren't suffering from clinical depression feel less stressed by helping to reduce levels of the body's natural stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, according to a recent study in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science.

If you're over 50, a study published last month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggests the best results come from combining aerobic and resistance exercise.

That could include anything from high-intensity interval training, like the 7-minute workout, to dynamic flow yoga, which intersperses strength-building poses like planks and push-ups with heart-pumping dance-like moves.

Another study published on May 3 provides some additional support to that research, finding that in adults aged 60-88, walking for 30 minutes four days a week for 12 weeks appeared to strengthen connectivity in a region of the brain where weakened connections have been linked with memory loss.

Researchers still aren't sure why this type of exercise appears to provide a boost to the brain, but studies suggest it has to do with increased blood flow, which provides our minds with fresh energy and oxygen.

And one recent study in older women who displayed potential symptoms of dementia found that aerobic exercise was linked with an increase in the size of the hippocampus, a brain area involved in learning and memory.

Joe Northey, the lead author of the British study and an exercise scientist at the University of Canberra, says his research suggests that anyone in good health over age 50 should do 45 minutes to an hour of aerobic exercise ""on as many days of the week as feasible"".

No.,http://www.pcgamer.com/are-wifi-signals-bad-for-my-health/,"Yes, we know that the idea of radio waves permeating through your residence does engender everything from concerns of inducing headaches, to increases in cancer, and even mind control. This is all enough for a select few to put on their tin foil hats, and move to Green Bank, West Virginia, the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) where all wireless transmissions are tightly controlled to facilitate scientific research. However, before we toss out our routers and pack our bags, let’s look at this a little more objectively.

The concerns go back over decade, and the potential disease was termed Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS). While not specific to wifi, individuals claimed vague symptoms to any source of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, and cellphone transmissions. The symptoms of EHS are all nonspecific, and included headaches, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, fatigue, tiredness and tingling. It should be realized that among medical professionals, this is currently not an accepted diagnosis, and currently has no treatment.

The very use of the term radiation brings up concern for health. However realize that WiFi is a non-ionizing radiation, as opposed to the ionizing radiation that is associated with nuclear plants, and X-rays. Furthermore, WiFi is closely regulated by the government, and devices have to comply to the low transmission standards of 100 milliwatts, which is why the range is quite limited.

Rather than sitting next to our wireless router, and waiting for a headache, we decided to peruse the medical literature for an answer to how real any potential health concerns from WiFi.

Research in this area gets done with “Sham WiFi,” where willing subjects are told they are being exposed to WiFi, which in some cases they are, and in other cases they are not. Researchers then look for a correlation to see if the symptoms of EHS can be associated with the actual WiFi exposure. Across multiple studies, including a review of thirty-one studies in this area published in Electromagnetics , there was no clear correlation found.

This leaves us wondering what is really going on here. It appears that this is a version of the “placebo effect,” with suggestible folks being convinced of the health detriments of wireless signals, but not confirmed by scientific research. Another study that came out this earlier this year suggests that media reports of potential symptoms from Wi-Fi may prime folks to develop these symptoms.

So, the bottom line on this is that there is no scientific evidence to support symptoms from WiFi. Therefore, cancel your travel plans to the NRQZ, put that tin foil hat back in the drawer, and keep using the wireless router.

NASA: ""No.""

",http://www.iflscience.com/space/nasa-wont-launch-humans-to-space-in-trumps-first-term/,"NASA has reaffirmed that it will not launch humans into space again until 2021, after the Trump administration asked them to look into bringing it forward to 2019.

The agency is currently developing its huge new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which will be used to one day launch astronauts to Mars.

In 2019, NASA is planning to launch the rocket for the first time with an unmanned Orion spacecraft on top, known as Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1), on a three-week mission around the Moon and back. A manned flight is scheduled to follow in 2021, called Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2).

However, the Trump administration had asked if NASA would consider putting a crew on the first flight – which would put it in Trump's first term. NASA looked into this, and has come back with a firm “no”.

“After evaluating cost, risk, and technical factors in a project of this magnitude, it is difficult to accommodate changes needed for a crewed EM-1 mission at this time,” NASA’s acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot, told employees in an email seen by The Verge.

In a press conference on Friday, Lightfoot said it would cost between $600 million and $900 million to put a two-person crew on EM-1. That’s because the spacecraft would need to be upgraded with life support systems, a launch abort system, and more.

“It really reaffirmed the baseline plan we had in place was the best way for us to go,” he said. “Leave EM-1 uncrewed.”

Trump had previously joked about the possibility of sending humans to Mars by 2024, so that it would take place in his potential second term (shudder). That has not really been taken seriously though, with the idea very much off the table.

“They have not asked us to go to Mars by 2024,” Lightfoot said in the press conference.

EM-1 has had a few problems so far, having been pushed back from 2018 to 2019 recently. And part of the rocket was damaged last week when it was accidentally dropped.

Once it does get up and running, though, the SLS will be the most powerful rocket in operation. And it will eventually eclipse the most powerful rocket of all time, the Saturn V.

This first launch is known as Block 1, and has a lifting capability of 70,000 kilograms (154,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit. Block 2, a bigger version of the SLS, will be able to carry 130,000 kilograms (287,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit.

Of course, this is not the only heavy-lift rocket in development. SpaceX is developing its Falcon Heavy rocket, which it intends to use to send humans around the Moon in 2018 and also for unmanned missions to Mars starting in 2020.

And SpaceX and Boeing will start launching astronauts to space, some for NASA, as early as next year.",NASA Won't Launch Humans To Space In Trump's First Term

Vinegar and a hot compress (heat). ,http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/scientists-have-found-the-best-way-to-treat-a-jellyfish-sting-and-no-its-not-pee/,"For anyone who has peed on their jellyfish sting (or got a friend to do it for them), I’ve got some bad news. It was completely unnecessary and probably made it worse. A new study has found that simply applying vinegar to the sting, followed by heat, is the best solution regardless of what species has stung you, going against decades of first aid procedures.

The current protocols recommended for stings by the man o’ war jellyfish (Physalia physalis), and its closely related counterpart, the bluebottle (Physalia utriculus), involve washing the affected area with salt water before scraping away the tentacles and applying an ice pack, in order to lessen the impact of the sting. It turns out that this is just about the worst thing you could do.

The process of scraping away tentacles has been found to apply more pressure to the area, which increased the firing of stinging capsules, meaning more venom was injected. Washing in salt water was found to spread the sting over the skin, increasing the area of skin that is actually stung. Adding ice packs to the region just made the pain even worse, reports a new study published in the journal Toxins.

Instead, the researchers found that the general treatment recommended for all other jellyfish stings, namely dowsing the affected area in vinegar, was equally as effective for man o’ wars. Not only that, but the researchers claim that the addition of heat to the stung skin – around 45 minutes of 45°C water or a heat pad – effectively inactivated the venom that had already been injected.

It has long been thought that species of jellyfish belonging to Physalia, which are not technically jellyfish but actually a colony of zooids, require different treatment to the blanket first aid practices recommended for true jellies. Yet after looking at why doctors recommend salt water and ice, and other old wives tale remedies that have risen up, such as lemon juice, shaving foam, and the infamous pee, researchers from Hawaii and Ireland could find no real evidence to back the claims up.

“Without solid science to back up medical practices, we have ended up with conflicting official recommendations around the world, leading to confusion and, in many cases, practices that actually worsen stings or even cost lives,” explained Angel Yanagihara, the senior author of the paper. To test the effectiveness of various treatments, the researchers used sheep and human blood cells in agar.

The research was carried out using the same methods as an earlier study looking into box jellyfish, and will now use it again to test lion’s mane jellies, to see if the same treatment really does hold true over a wide range of species.","Scientists Have Found The Best Way To Treat A Jellyfish Sting, And No, It's Not Pee"
Higher production of innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) due to lower levels of testosterone. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/why-women-are-more-likely-to-get-asthma-than-men/,"She may look suspiciously at the pollen-producing tree, but it's not just making her life a misery, it's engaging in sexual descrimination while it does it.

Last year, Melbourne, Australia, experienced an unprecedented “thunderstorm asthma” event. Some 10,000 people were rushed to the hospital, struggling to breathe, with at least nine deaths. No breakdown has been published, but if this resembled most other such events, two-thirds of those affected were women. Adult women are roughly twice as likely to suffer asthma as men, even though boys get it more frequently than girls. Now, a research institution based in the heart of Melbourne has laid the blame for this difference with testosterone.

The hormone testosterone gets blamed, or credited, with all sorts of differences between men and women, often falsely. However, Dr Cyril Seillet and colleagues at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute found it also plays an unexpected role in asthma.

In the Journal of Experimental Medicine, the researchers report that testosterone suppresses the production of innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Since ILC2s can react to pollen, dust mites, or cigarette smoke by producing inflammatory proteins that trigger asthma attacks, the reduction in these cells that men experience after puberty makes them less likely to suffer the attacks. “In males, you have less ILC2s in the lungs and this directly correlates with the reduced severity of asthma,"" Seillet said in a statement.

The discovery makes finding other ways to suppress ILC2s a natural line of research to tackle the rising rates of asthma. ""Current treatments for severe asthma, such as steroids, are very broad based and can have significant side effects,"" said co-author Professor Gabrielle Belz.

Seillet told IFLScience the researchers are looking for compounds that modulate ILC2s without the effects testosterone has on other tissues in the body. He said that a number of molecules already used for other purposes have potential, and testing is underway.

Naturally, ILC2s would not have survived in the body if their effects were entirely negative, and their reaction to dust mites gives a hint of their evolutionary function. Seillet told IFLScience they have an important role in protecting against parasite infections, as well as having an influence on obesity. Theoretically, it might be expected that men's lower ILC2 production would increase vulnerability to parasites, but Seillet said this has yet to be investigated.

Seillet added that ILC2s and testosterone are not the whole story when it comes to explaining asthma. “Asthma is multifactorial,” he told IFLScience. “It is triggered by environmental cues and influenced by genetic background.” However, Seillet and his colleagues investigated the difference observed between rates in men and women, for which testosterone's influence on ILC2s proved explanatory.",Why Women Are More Likely To Get Asthma Than Men
123456. ,http://www.thisisinsider.com/most-popular-passwords-incredibly-insecure-easy-to-guess-123456-hacking-2017-1?utm_content=buffer47b4a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer,"It's official: People are dreadful at picking passwords.

The world's most popular password is the disappointingly easy-to-guess 123456, according to a massive analysis of 10 million leaked passwords.

Throughout 2016, we saw numerous major data breaches leaking people's login details online. Some were new — like the hack of adult dating site AdultFriendFinder — while others, like LinkedIn, were years-old, but the data only recently surfaced online.

In both cases, these breaches have provided researchers with an unparalleled look at the security habits of millions of people — and it's not pretty.

Security firm Keeper trawled through 10 million records that leaked in 2016, and found that a shocking 17% of people used the basic, insecure password 123456. (We heard about the analysis via The Register.)

In second place was the barely better 123456789, followed by the predictable qwerty. Then came 12345678, and in fifth place was the insecure 111111.

""Looking at the list of 2016’s most common passwords, we couldn’t stop shaking our heads,"" the researchers wrote in a blog post. ""Four of the top 10 passwords on the list — and seven of the top 15 — are six characters or shorter. This is stunning in light of the fact that, as we’ve reported, today’s brute-force cracking software and hardware can unscramble those passwords in seconds. Website operators that permit such flimsy protection are either reckless or lazy.""

What's more, Keeper says, recommendations about good security practices are just failing to get through to a lot of people.

""The list of most-frequently used passwords has changed little over the past few years,"" it writes. ""That means that user education has limits. While it’s important for users to be aware of risks, a sizable minority are never going to take the time or effort to protect themselves. IT administrators and website operators must do the job for them.""

Longer passwords can be harder to remember. But that's not an excuse to just use qwerty. Security experts recommend that people use a different, strong password for each service or website they have an account with, storing them with a password manager app if necessary. That way, if one service you used is breached, your accounts on others aren't compromised as well.

And you should also activate two-factor authentication whenever possible, so that even if your password is exposed, attackers still can't get into your account without access to your phone.

On a long enough timescale, everyone gets hacked. But by not using — and re-using — weak passwords, you can limit the damage.

Finally, here's the full list. If any of your passwords are on here, change them immediately.

Nope, the resolution on your monitor isn't wrong. Her owners were shocked - being the only girl in the litter wasn't enough for this little one apparently!

After getting over the shock, her owners named her Fiona - like the princess/ogre from Shrek. So fitting! Here are some pictures of Fiona:

But why is her color green? Keep reading to find out what everyone is saying.

One theory as to why they're green comes from Time , who say that it may be because of an over-exposure to biliverdin, which is a green pigment in the placenta.

Thankfully, according to Life with Dogs , it's not a health concern at all. Kind of sad, but it fades after a few weeks. But Fiona will always be known as the green pup!

It's an invasive species called giant hogweed. Its sap causes horrible blisters. Snopes and other details in comments. ,http://realfarmacy.com/dont-touch-plant/,"They should teach this in school but unfortunately just like most important life skills it is up to us to educate our children and each other so make sure you SHARE this! The plant is called giant hogweed and the pretty white flowers can be quite alluring, but whatever you do make no mistake touching it!

Kids are especially in danger due to curiosity.

This might come as a surprise, but there are only about 10 plants in North America (not including fungi) that kids need to know to steer clear of. Currently, kids are too busy preparing for and taking tests, something nations excelling at education such as Finland don’t do (source), rather than learning practical knowledge such as how to identify poison oak or worse, hogweed!

So spread the word and teach your kids. Here’s what you should know:

Interestingly, the giant hogweed is part of the Carrot family and can grow up to 14 ft tall loaded with deadly toxic sap!

The results of merely brushing up against it are horrifying. If you accidentally break a stem or touch any of the sap you will begin to develop grotesque blisters! Due to the height of the stalk this is easy to accidentally do. Characteristics to watch out for include green stems with purple patches that are a bit hairy with white hairs.

According to Ask a Prepper:

If you come into contact with the plant’s sap you can expect severe blistering, possible blindness if it comes into contact with your eyes and possible third degree burns. These effects come from the type of chemicals that it contains. When these chemicals come in contact with human skin they dramatically increase the skin’s sensitivity to light.

This can cause blisters that are actually very painful and form within around 48 hours and can last from anywhere between a few months to six years. It can cause LONG TERM sensitivity to light if the sap gets in the eye.

Measures to Take if You or Your Child Comes in Contact With It

Obviously you want to avoid it in the first place but what if you happen to come in contact with giant hogweed?

Immediately wash the affected area with cold water. Make haste because the toxic reaction may begin within only 15 minutes and make sure you get out of the sun!

Apply a safe sunscreen on the effected area ASAP. It’s always good to have some of this excellent DIY recipe on hand just in case.

In the unfortunate event that the sap comes in contact with your eyes, immediately flush with water extensively. Then be sure to wear sunglasses for protection!

Recently some states made public warnings after these plants were spotted. The Blaze reported:

In recent weeks, New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation and the state of Massachusetts have issued detailed public warnings about the plant and the serious problems caused by coming in contact with it. These two states are not alone. In the northeastern region, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine are all reporting sightings of the plant. Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan are sending out warnings. Out west, Oregon and Washington have seen giant hogweed spreading.

How to Get Rid Of It

If you do spot it you have the option to report it to the EPA (US Environmental Protection Agency) hotline – 1-800-424-8802or your individual state agency as suggested. Officials warn not to remove the plant yourself or may risk spreading seeds.

""Hypoallergenic"" products are popular for their perceived skin benefits.

But the definition of ""hypoallergenic"" is not standardized or regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration.

The term can mean whatever manufacturers want it to mean.

And research shows some ""hypoallergenic"" products actually contain allergens.

People with skin allergies probably trust that ""hypoallergenic"" products will be free of ingredients that cause itchy, painful reactions. So they might be surprised to learn that the term ""hypoallergenic"" is essentially meaningless.

You don't have to take our word for it — take the US Food and Drug Administration's.

""There are no federal standards or definitions that govern the use of the term 'hypoallergenic,'"" the FDA writes on its website. ""The term means whatever a particular company wants it to mean.""

And it might not mean much.

In a 2015 study, for example, scientists tested 135 children's skin-care products labeled ""hypoallergenic"" and found that almost 90% contained at least one known skin allergen.

In an April 1978 issue of its ""FDA Consumer"" magazine, the agency explained that it did try to regulate the term during the 1970s. The agency wanted to allow the use of ""hypoallergenic"" only if human studies showed a product caused a significantly lower rate of allergic reactions compared to other products. But cosmetic companies fought the FDA in court and won. To this day, ""hypoallergenic"" is still unregulated, and manufacturers don't have to offer the FDA any proof to back up the claim.

This doesn't mean that all companies who use the term are trying to deceive you. Some might voluntarily put their products through a barrage of high-quality allergy testing, but it's hard to know that when you're browsing store shelves in search of a new product. In the drugstore, when you see the term on two different products, it could mean two totally different things.

The bottom line: Don't assume that ""hypoallergenic"" products will never cause an allergic reaction. If you see a company using the marketing term, you might want to check their website or contact customer service and see if they have additional information on their interpretation of its meaning.

Google’s now-banned interview questions have become the stuff of Internet folklore. But now, a former interviewee of Microsoft has revealed a question he was asked after applying for a job at the multi-billion dollar company. According to his story, their selection process is no more forgiving than Google's.

Prashant Bagdia posted on the website Quora the story of his friend who went for a job interview at Microsoft. For the last question, the interviewer asked: “A right triangle has a hypotenuse equal to 10 and an altitude to the hypotenuse equal to 6. Find the area of the triangle.”

Partly wondering why a software employer would be interested in a high school geometry question and partly wondering if this was a trick, the interviewee finally managed to piece together an answer he thought was correct, saying: “Sir, as area of any triangle is 0.5*base*height, the answer to this question would be 0.5 *10*6 which evaluates to 30!”

But his confident response was shut down by the interviewer. He was offered another chance to think about the question, but he stuck to his guns and was quickly told his answer was incorrect.

So why would they ask such a question? Well, rather deviously, a triangle with those measurements can’t exist.

As Prashant explains in his post , if the altitude is at a 45-degree angle and the hypotenuse is 10, then the largest the altitude can be is 5, as any higher altitude can’t exist in a right-angled triangle.

Altruism. ,http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/one-quality-in-men-might-be-even-more-attractive-than-good-looks-and-a-sense-of-humor/,"Most people would think that if it's not good looks that make a man most attractive to women, then it's definitely a sense of humor.

But studies consistently show that altruism is a top quality women are drawn to when they are looking for a relationship.

And a new study in the British Journal of Psychology found that altruistic men may have more sex, too.

The researchers asked unmarried Canadian adults how much they did good deeds like giving money to charity or helping someone get their car out of the snow. They then asked the participants how often they had sex and how many partners they've had.

Men who reported more altruistic acts had more sex — and more partners. For those who were in relationships, good-hearted men were more likely to have had more sex in the last 30 days, too.

In the second experiment of the study, the researchers had undergraduate students say whether they would like to donate money that they might receive for participating to charity. Those who said that they would also tended to have more casual sex, more sex in relationships, and more lifetime sex partners overall.

Another study, published in January 2016 in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, presented 202 women with different men to choose from. The different combinations of choices were either attractive or not, and they either did a good deed or didn't.

The women chose the selfish, attractive men for a one-night stand. But for a long-term relationship, they chose the altruistic man whether he was attractive or not.

A slightly older study, published in The Journal of Social Psychology in 2013, really drives this home. That study found that women valued altruism above other traits as a measure of whether a potential mate would make a good parent. The women also said that altruism was important for short-term relationships, but significantly more women said that the trait mattered for the long term.

Planks. ,http://buff.ly/2pa07uj,"The INSIDER Summary:

Most people think sit-ups and crunches will give you a 6 pack.

Harvard doctors say that planks are far more effective.

Planks engage way more core muscles than crunches do.

If you think sit-ups are the quickest ticket to 6-pack abs, the physicians at Harvard Medical School have news for you: That classic exercise isn't as efficient as it seems.

Instead of crunches, they suggest doing planks, the exercise that involves holding yourself on your hands and toes in a pre-push-up position. The findings are detailed in a Harvard Medical School health report called ""Core Exercises.""

As opposed to sit-ups, which target only your abdominal muscles, planks recruit several groups of muscles along your sides, front, and back. If you want a strong core — especially the kind that would give you 6-pack-like definition across your abs — you need to challenge all of these muscles.

""Sit-ups or crunches strengthen just a few muscle groups,"" write the authors of the Harvard Healthbeat newsletter, which summarizes the report's key takeaways. ""Through dynamic patterns of movement, a good core workout helps strengthen the entire set of core muscles you use every day.""

Shutterstock

Conventional crunches may also be hard on different parts of your body, including your back, which gets pushed against the floor. Additionally, when you pull your body up into a sit-up position, you're working a group of muscles called the hip flexors which run from your thighs to the lumbar vertebrae in your lower back. When these muscles get too tight or become overly-strengthened, they can yank on your lower spine . This can cause pain or discomfort in your lower back.

And unlike ab-crunch machines, planks don't require a single piece of equipment, so you can do them anywhere.

Ready to give them a try?

The folks at Health.com recommend starting out by lying face-down with your legs extended and your elbows bent, directly under your shoulders, with your hands clasped. Your feet should be hip-width apart; your elbows should be shoulder-width apart. Next, tighten your abs and tuck your toes to elevate your body, keeping your forearms on the ground. Your body should be in a straight line from your head to your heels. To start, hold it for one minute.

As you get stronger, you can gradually build up to maintain the position for longer periods of time, and extend your arms to hold yourself up on your palms.

Contempt (a mix of anger and disgust). ,http://www.thisisinsider.com/behavior-thats-the-kiss-of-death-for-a-relationship-2016-1?utm_content=bufferdee4f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer,"The INSIDER Summary:

• Contempt is the most toxic behavior in a relationship.

• Researchers find it so powerful that they can use it — along with other negative behaviors — to predict divorce with 93% accuracy.





On the way home from work you have every intention of greeting your partner with a friendly ""Hi, how are you? How was your day?"" and listening attentively while he or she tells you all about it.

But the minute you open the door and drop your keys on the counter, you find yourself knee-deep in an argument about how he or she bought the wrong type of pepper.

Don't worry: It's perfectly normal to get into arguments like these with your significant other every once in a while, John Gottman, a psychologist at the University of Washington and founder of the Gottman Institute, told Business Insider.

It's what happens next that you need to watch out for, he says.

When you express your frustration over the pepper mix-up, do you listen while he explains that perhaps you didn't ever tell him what type of pepper you wanted? Do you think this over, and, when you realize that maybe he's right, do you apologize? Or do you adopt an attitude and think to yourself, ""What kind of an idiot doesn't know that bell peppers are for stir-fry and habaneros are for salsa?""

If you find yourself in the second situation, you're likely displaying contempt for your partner, and it could be putting your relationship in jeopardy.

Contempt, a virulent mix of anger and disgust, is far more toxic than simple frustration or negativity. It involves seeing your partner as beneath you, rather than as an equal.

Associated Press

Gottman and University of California at Berkeley psychologist Robert Levenson found this single behavior is so powerful that they can use it — along with the negative behaviors of criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling — to predict divorce with 93% accuracy

""Contempt,"" says Gottman, ""is the kiss of death.""

The striking 93% figure comes from a 14-year study of 79 couples living across the US Midwest (21 of whom divorced during the study period) published in 2002. Since then, decades of research into marriage and divorce have lent further support to the idea linking divorce with specific negative behaviors.

One recent study of 373 newlywed couples, for example, found that couples who yelled at each other, showed contempt for each other, or simply began to disengage from conflict within the first year of marriage were more likely to divorce, even as far as 16 years down the road.

Why are couples who exhibit this one behavior more likely to split up?

It comes down to a superiority complex.

Feeling smarter than, better than, or more sensitive than your significant other means you're not only less likely see his or her opinions as valid, but, more importantly, you're far less willing to try to put yourself in his or her shoes to try to see a situation from his or her perspective.

Picture a resonance chamber, suggests Gottman, with each person in the relationship a source of his or her own musical (or emotional) vibrations. If each partner is closed off to the other person's vibes (or emotions) and more interested in unleashing their own feelings of disgust and superiority, these negative vibrations will resound against one another, escalating a bad situation ""until something breaks,"" Gottman says.

If you've noticed yourself or your partner exhibiting this type of behavior, don't despair — it doesn't mean your relationship is doomed.

Being aware that you're doing something that could negatively affect your partner is the first step to actively combating it. If you can figure out how to avoid the behavior or replace it with a more positive one, you'll likely greatly improve the relationship — and increase your chances of staying together for longer.

After Vitti was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) at the age of 20, she alleviated her symptoms naturally through changing her diet. Now, she wants to help others do the same.

According to Vitti, cutting out caffeine is a simple step that can make an enormous difference.

""Just nixing caffeine alone will stop you from depleting essential magnesium and B vitamin stores that are water soluble that caffeine forces you to flush out at higher concentration,"" she told INSIDER. ""Those two micronutrient deficiencies alone can kick off an entire hormonal imbalance and set you down the road of problems. If you just cut out the caffeine as one thing, you will feel dramatically better with your next cycle.""

Her FLOLiving program includes a caffeine step-down plan to wean addicts off of their daily fix.

""It should be a controlled substance, in my opinion,"" she said. ""It's very telling that there's a coffee shop on every corner — it's very addicting. Couple that with sugar and you're now stimulating two very powerful addiction centers in the body. It quickly runs people out of hormonal balance very easily.""

Instead of coffee, Vitti swears by other hot beverages like rooibos tea lattes that provide the same kind of ritual without the disruptive affects.

""You get more energized by feeding your hormones properly than you do by triaging your fatigue with caffeine,"" she said. ""The earlier you get off it, the better.""",The one thing you should cut out of your diet to feel healthier and more energized

And so, when the time is right and they decide to start trying for a baby, they typically figure that they'll get pregnant right away.

But in reality, most couples don't conceive immediately after they start trying, according to Dr. Shruti Malik from Shady Grove Fertility in Virginia.

""Most couples will conceive in about six months or less,"" Malik told INSIDER. ""So it's interesting, because I have a lot of patients who spent a good portion of their adolescence trying to prevent pregnancy, and then later find out that it's more difficult than one would necessarily presume.""

The fertility expert explained that couples who have no history of infertility, and are having regular unprotected sex, have a 15% to 20% chance of conceiving per cycle.

""So if you were to consider all of those, if you have six cycles of doing that, most couples will conceive in that six-month window,"" Malik said.

However, if a couple has been having regular unprotected intercourse without getting pregnant for 12 months, it is recommended that they either seek a fertility consultation to get more information, or consider treatment for possible infertility.

""If she has not conceived in that window, there is a higher likelihood that there may be other factors that are contributing to that couple's difficulty in conceiving. And at that point in time, it warrants seeing a physician or fertility specialist,"" Malik explained.",Here's how long it usually takes couples to get pregnant

While businesses boasting clever Wi-Fi passcodes aren’t anything new (earlier this year, a Chinese restaurant made headlines after it made customers solve an equation to figure out its menu prices), the equation is proving impossible to solve, and subsequently driving Redditors to the brink of madness.

But as Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy explains in a recent Big Think video, the average person will probably find more success (and happiness) if they shoot for just down the block — at least at first.

The biggest mistake a lot of people make in setting goals for themselves, Cuddy says, is that they focus only on the outcome, not the process.

Cuddy is an expert on human behavior and the author of ""Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges."" She's conducted loads of research into tiny triggers that cause us to either take pride in our accomplishments or look back on our failings with regret and disappointment.

She's found that people often get down on themselves because of unrealistic or poorly planned goals.

""They're so big. They're so distant,"" Cuddy says of moonshots such as losing 40 pounds or getting a dream job. ""They require a million little steps in between, and each of those little steps is an opportunity to fail.""

The smarter approach is to learn to embrace the process.

On its face, that may seem counter-productive, like you're taking your eyes off the prize. But Cuddy emphasizes the power of using long-term thinking for short-term planning. You won't lose all the weight overnight, so your best option is to focus on making each day the best it can be. Chop up the big goal into a string of daily or weekly goals that are easier to accomplish.

""A lot of research is showing us that we do much better when we focus on incremental change, on little bits of improvement,"" Cuddy says.

That's how you go from a couch potato to a marathoner. You temporarily ignore the fact you need to run 26.2 miles several months from now, and focus only on running one mile today. And since that goal is much easier to achieve, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment once it's complete.

In turn, that creates the extra motivation you need to move onto a second and third run, and, ultimately, the race itself.

60+ million years ago. ,https://www.seeker.com/a-chunk-of-india-and-eurasia-just-disappeared-2041404910.html,"Half of the mass of Eurasia and India is missing, new research finds, and may have been swallowed up by the Earth's mantle.

If so, that would be a surprise, as geoscientists thought that continental crust - the kind that makes up major landmasses - was too buoyant to dive down into the mantle, the pliable middle layer of the planet upon which the crust rides.

""It used to be thought that the mantle and the crust interacted only in a relatively minor way,"" study researcher David Rowley, a geoscientist at the University of Chicago, said in a statement. ""This work suggests that, at least in certain circumstances, that's not true."" [Photo Timeline: How the Earth Formed]

The mystery of the missing crust emerged as Rowley and his colleagues examined the slow-moving collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. These two rafts of continental crust have been bumping against each other for 60 million years, crumpling up to form the Himalayan mountains. The researchers combined multiple data sources to figure out the original size of the two continental plates before they started colliding.

RELATED: Forces That Created Himalayas Caused Afghan Quake

These new calculations, published online Sept. 19 in the journal Nature Geoscience, revealed a strange imbalance. Even after accounting for the ruched bits of crust that climbed upward to form the Himalayas, the excess that squeezed out the sides to form southeast Asia, and the crust that eroded over 60 million years and ended up in the oceans, Rowley and his colleagues couldn't explain where half of the original mass of India and Eurasia went. [Earth's 8 Biggest Mysteries]

That led to an unprecedented conclusion.

""If we've accounted for all possible solutions at the surface, it means the remaining mass must have been recycled wholesale into the mantle,"" said study researcher Miquela Ingalls, a graduate student in geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago.

Unknown interactions

Continental crust isn't supposed to be able to sink in that way. Geoscientists have long known that dense oceanic crust can be ""recycled"" into the mantle - this is the geologic process that happens at subduction zones like the one off the coast of California. Oceanic crust slides under less dense continental crust like a conveyer belt and, under pressure, becomes ductile and gooey, mixing in with the mantle.

But because continental crust is so buoyant, researchers thought it acted more like a pool raft: Push it down, and it will just pop back up again.

RELATED: Mt. Everest Shrank as Nepal Quake Lifted Kathmandu

The new research might cause researchers to re-evaluate that interaction and how it works. But the study also has the potential to explain some geochemical mysteries. For example, volcanic eruptions sometimes spew out elements like lead and uranium, which aren't very common in the mantle. These elements are pretty common in continental crust, however. If the India-Eurasia collision is representative, it might explain how these continental materials get recycled into the mantle and then erupt out again, Rowley said.

""The implication of our work is that, if we're seeing the India-Asia collision system as an ongoing process over Earth's history, there has been a continuous mixing of the continental crustal elements back into the mantle,"" he said.

A study has finally found the source of Antarctica's gruesome ""Blood Falls.""

It's been 106 years since Australian geologist Griffith Taylor discovered the vivid red falls flowing from the glacier named after him, onto the icy Lake Bonney.

It was originally thought to be caused by red algae, but it wasn't until 2003 that it was decided the red color came from oxidized iron and water most likely draining from a 5 million-year-old saltwater lake.

Now a study from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Colorado College confirms the glacier has not only a lake underneath it but also a water system that has been flowing for a million years.

The team used echolocation to track where the water flowed. The reason it has never frozen, they say, is a perpetual hydraulic system that sees the heat energy released by water freezing, in turn melting the surrounding ice.

No. ,http://www.inquisitr.com/3626660/is-peppa-pig-causing-autism-and-making-kids-lose-their-sense-of-empathy/,"Each Peppa Pig episode leaves kids laughing, but the charming pig is again under fire for being linked to autism and other long-term developmental issues. A new round of rumors have emerged that the well-loved show poses dangers to its young viewers.

The reports are based on a so-called 2012 research by epidemiologist Marc Wildemberg from Harvard University. Wildemberg claims that children who watch Peppa Pig for at least half an hour have 56 percent increased chances of having autism. While the alleged study already made headlines years ago, several media outlets have brought back the story.

Stories linking the British cartoon to developmental problems appear to be unfounded because according to some experts, searching for the epidemiologist on Google doesn't yield any credible information. It is possible that the reports were only fabricated in an attempt to discredit Peppa Pig.

It isn't the first time that Peppa Pig faced criticisms. In a previous interview with Courier Mail via Daily Mail, Dr. Karen Philip used Peppa Pig as an example of a cartoon that prevents kids from ""developing skills in empathy and reading other people's body language.""

She claims that children aged 4 to 5 get so used to watching the television that they fail to develop complete brain functions. Despite this, she reminds parents that the potentially harmful effects of television may be reversed if parents will allow their children to watch educational programs instead. Philip adds that something good can still come out from watching Peppa Pig.

""If parents interact with them during a show or if they want to watch, say Peppa Pig, and they're doing the singing and dancing and interacting, that's completely different.""

""Parents complain that their children copy Peppa's annoying behavior - behaving like a brat, burping and blowing raspberries all the time, and saying 'I don't want to play with you anymore' to their friends (just like Peppa does). That and they start jumping in muddy puddles all the time!""

Some believe that Peppa Pig contains sinister messages and portrays stereotypes. One example that parents cite is that Daddy Pig is the one who has an ""important job"" while Mommy Pig is the one who often goes around making tea. There are children who allegedly copy George's responses to food. When asked what they would love to have for breakfast, some kids would answer ""chocolate cake."" They would also say ""yuck"" when parents try to feed them vegetables.

On the other hand, Lifestyle One reports that many consider Peppa Pig to be educational. One mother, whose son has developmental delays, lauds the show.

""He now knows some things that we have never even mentioned to him, such as actions for Twinkle Twinkle Little Star… We have seen a massive improvement since he has been paying attention to the [show].""

Many insist that at the end of the day, it is the job of parents to limit their children's access to technology. There is no evidence yet that watching television indeed leads to autism, but studies advise that a child diagnosed as autistic must have limited access to the screen in order for him or her to have more meaningful pursuits. Cartoons, when carefully selected, can help children connect better with their peers.

"Tranexamic acid, a substance that helps blood clot more quickly. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/this-cheap-old-drug-can-save-thousands-of-new-mothers-from-bleeding-to-death,"A large international trial has showed that a cheap, readily available drug could save the lives of thousands of women each year who suffer from excessive bleeding after giving birth.

Even though childbirth is safer than ever, post-partum haemorrhage is still a major killer of new mums around the world, accounting for more than 100,000 deaths every year. But now the results are in on a drug that could help solve the problem.

A major study of 20,000 women in 21 countries has shown that a simple intravenous injection of tranexamic acid can prevent a third of the deaths caused by post-partum bleeding.

Tranexamic acid, which essentially helps blood clot more quickly, is not a new medicine. It was discovered by Japanese doctor Utako Okamoto back in the 1960s, when she was looking for something that could treat devastating bleeding after childbirth.

But at that time, she couldn't persuade any obstetricians to do a trial.

Now it is one of the medications available for women with heavy periods, and is used in different types of surgery to prevent excessive blood loss.

Large-scale trials have already shown that injections of tranexamic acid can prevent deaths from bleeding after accidents, and in 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) even added it to the list of essential medicines.

But until this latest trial, we still didn't have solid evidence on whether the drug would indeed be helpful for post-partum bleeding.

To test this hypothesis, in 2010 a research team led by scientists from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine embarked on a massive trial spanning six years and 21 countries on four continents.

Researchers randomly assigned women with clinically diagnosed post-birth bleeding to either receive a placebo or a tranexamic acid injection in addition to all the usual medical care their cases required.

The study was properly blinded - neither the patients nor the doctors administering the injection knew whether it contained the drug.

The researchers found that if tranexamic acid was injected within three hours after giving birth, it reduced deaths from post-birth bleeding by nearly one-third.

It also appears that it doesn't matter what the cause of the bleeding is, or even what type of birth the woman had - tranexamic acid is still effective, as long as it's given quickly.

These are some amazing results. If every woman who suffers life-threatening bleeding could receive this drug, it could save tens of thousands of lives every year.

Scientists are now looking at new ways to make the drug easy to administer. It's even possible that for women who are at higher risk, a tablet could be given before birth.

This is especially relevant in many African countries, where women often don't get timely treatment for pregnancy-related anemia.

""Half the women giving birth there start off with roughly half the red blood cells they should have,"" one of the researchers, Ian Roberts, told Donald G. McNeil at The New York Times.

""Doctors are forced to throw in everything they've got, because they know the woman can be dead in an hour.""

Currently, the WHO guidelines for the treatment of post-partum haemorrhage recommend injecting drugs that contract the uterus, such as oxytocin, in addition to massaging the uterus. The guidelines do mention tranexamic acid, but it's not a first-line treatment.

Now that we know its life-saving potential, those guidelines are ready for an update.

""Our results support the inclusion of tranexamic acid in WHO treatment guidelines for primary post-partum haemorrhage,"" the researchers write.

Tranexamic acid is available as a generic medication, and an injection can cost less than a dollar.

But researchers emphasise that in many low-income and middle-income countries, women die of post-partum bleeding at home, where nobody can quickly give them an intravenous injection.

Many of the patients in the trial whose deaths could not be prevented arrived at the hospital too late.

""We have to make sure tranexamic acid is available wherever a woman gives birth and is at risk,"" lead researcher Haleema Shakur told Sarah Boseley at The Guardian.

""We must make sure doctors and midwives are aware of the results of the study. And we need health ministers to make sure that the drug is available in their country and is on their shopping list of essential medicines.""

Local media have reported that a hickey (or chupetón) the teen received from his girlfriend caused a blood clot that in turn led to his fatal stroke.

Should you be worried about getting a blood clot from your next love bite?

No. You really should not. It’s not impossible that a hickey could cause a blood clot that leads to a stroke, but it’s incredibly unlikely, according to Charles Abrams, president of the American Society of Hematology and a hematologist at the University of Pennsylvania. It could happen if a person’s blood vessels are torn during the chomp. “But I think that would be pretty hard to do,” he says.

Blood clots can form both in veins, which carry blood to your heart, and in arteries, which are more muscular and carry blood away from it. Clots are more likely to form when blood flow is sluggish, and can be related to a variety of different conditions.

If a clot forms or becomes lodged in an artery, it can cut off blood flow to the heart or part of the brain, causing a heart attack or a stroke. This is typically caused by atherosclerosis—in which plaques of fat and cholesterol build up in the arteries, making them harder and narrower—rather than an injury.

It’s more common for injuries to cause blood clots to form in a vein. “I’m very surprised that a hickey could actually do this,” Abrams says. “It has to be real trauma in order to cause an arterial clot, probably much more significant than the trauma that it takes to form a clot in a vein.”

This is not the only report of a love bite apparently causing a blood clot and stroke. In 2010, the New Zealand Medical Journal described the case of a 44-year-old woman who experienced weakness in her arm several days after getting a hickey. She recovered after being treated with blood thinners. The physicians who wrote up her report described the incident as “an uncommon mode of blunt trauma” to the neck and carotid artery.

Blood clots in veins don’t typically cause strokes, but they can lead to deep vein thrombosis, aka the reason you should stretch your legs during a long flight. Clots that form in the deep veins of your legs, arms or torso can become lodged in the lungs, a dangerous situation called pulmonary embolism.

The odds of dying from a hickey-induced blood clot are vanishingly small. But venous blood clots kill more people than breast cancer, car crashes, and AIDS combined each year. “I’m struck by this hickey-associated clot, but I’m more concerned about the more common and real risk of having a clot in a vein,” Abrams says.",Can You Really Die From A Hickey?

If processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. Surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate.

“We propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system,” write graduate student Erica Schulte and Dr. Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan in PLOS ONE.

The authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as “loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so.” They back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist.

“Although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating,” the authors write.

To test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the Yale Food Addiction Scale, of which Gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors.","According To Science, This Is The Most Addictive Food In The World"
It bypasses their brains and accumulates in their eyes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/something-weird-happens-give-cocaine-fish/,"Sometimes, in the name of science, you have to give cocaine to a fish. But when you do, be prepared for something a little strange to happen.

Researchers in Switzerland have recently discovered that when zebrafish are given the white stuff, it bypasses their brains and accumulates in their eyes. Though this might not sound like a world-changing revelation, it could actually have a major impact on the way that new medicines are studied in the future.

Despite the fact that zebrafish don’t have much in common with people, they are at least vertebrates, and therefore have a central nervous system that scientists can play around with and test all sorts of experimental drugs on. As such, they are often used as aquatic guinea pigs, particularly when researchers want to observe the effects of psychoactive substances that they don’t feel comfortable using on humans.

However, reporting their findings in the journal Toxicological Sciences, the study authors provide clear evidence that some drugs – in this case cocaine – do not have the same effect on zebrafish as they do on mammals. Indeed, cocaine primarily acts on the brain when taken by those of us who live on dry land, yet heads straight to the eyes in zebrafish. This means that any data obtained using fish may not in fact be relevant to humans, thereby ruling out the possibility of using certain marine species to study drugs.

Cocaine affects neurotransmitters in the brain, resulting in hyperactivity. Roman Samborskyi/Shutterstock

To conduct their investigation, the team placed zebrafish larvae in tanks containing water contaminated with various amounts of cocaine, before using an imaging technique called Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry to observe where in their bodies the drug accumulated. Amazingly, they found that only a small amount ended up in the brain, although massive concentrations – sufficient to kill a person – built up in the eyes.

Though the researchers aren’t entirely sure why this is the case, they speculate that cocaine may have a chemical affinity for melanin, which is found in the eyes.

In contrast, when people take cocaine it acts on the brain, triggering the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, resulting in hyperactivity. Yet the drug has the exact opposite effect on zebrafish, causing them to become less active. The study authors suggest this is because it acts like an anaesthetic when it comes into contact with the skin, gills, and peripheral nervous system.

Study co-author Kristin Schirmer explained in a statement that “if we want to have a better knowledge of the effects of such chemicals on the ecosystem, we need a more detailed understanding of the processes of uptake through water – they’re quite different from when drugs are inhaled or injected.”",Something Weird Happens When You Give Cocaine To Fish

CNN —

What health condition concerns Americans the most? Cancer – more so than obesity, neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and even infectious diseases, such as Zika, Ebola and HIV/AIDS.

That’s just one of many findings about Americans’ opinions on health that emerged in the latest Mayo Clinic National Health Checkup survey results, released Tuesday.

The idea behind the survey was to simply “listen to our patients,” said Dr. John Wald, medical director for public affairs at the Mayo Clinic, who helped conduct the survey.

“This survey allows us to extend this same principle beyond the walls of our campuses to assess the current state of the American health consumer and to begin to define gaps and opportunities to better interact and educate these same consumers,” he said. “It is only through effective listening that you begin to define the best solutions.”

The survey was conducted July 28 through 31 and involved 1,008 adults nationwide.

The participants were asked questions via telephone about which health conditions they believed to be the “most important” health challenge in the country, how much progress modern medicine was making in treating those conditions, and which health care concerns would weigh into their decision for voting for a specific presidential candidate, among others.

The results revealed that a majority of the respondents – 37% – believed cancer to be the No. 1 most significant health care challenge in the country, followed by obesity as No. 2, neurological diseases as three, diabetes as four and heart disease as five. Infectious diseases were thought to be the least significant.

“Interestingly, only 3% viewed the Zika virus as a significant health care challenge,” Wald said.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but cancer comes in as a close second. About 84% of respondents said they would be interested in a vaccine to prevent cancer, if one existed.

More people living in the West (21%) than in the South (13%), Northeast (10%) or Midwest (8%) said they would not be interested in a cancer vaccine.

Most respondents – 38% – considered brain cancer to be the “scariest” type. About 20% of respondents said pancreatic was the most concerning type, 10% said lung, 8% said breast, 7% said prostate, 5% said colon, and 5% said skin.

“Cancer has always been a scary disease in American life, especially in the years when there was little one could do about it,” said Dr. Howard Markel, director of the University of Michigan Medical School’s Center for the History of Medicine, who was not involved in the new survey.

“Early in the 20th century well into the 1970s, people called it the ‘C-word’ and did not want to discuss it publicly. That has been changing in the past few decades, thanks to the host of wonderful advances in modern medicine, but serious cancer remains, well, serious. So I am not surprised,” he said of the survey results.

However, while respondents pointed to cancer as the most important health care challenge, 74% said that they believed some progress was being made to address it.

Most of the respondents – 83% – said some progress was being made in developing new treatments for heart disease, and fewer – 52% – said progress was being made with obesity.

Respondents also weighed in on their personal health in the survey. About 86% said they get headaches; 63% said their headaches are triggered by stress, 54% said by not eating and 41% said by not getting enough sleep.

About 72% of respondents defined a good night’s sleep as snoozing seven to eight hours, but nearly half – 49% – said they achieve that much shut-eye half the time or less, on average.

With the 2016 presidential election approaching in November, 95% of respondents said health care issues would weigh into their decision in voting for a specific candidate.

What influences their choice of a presidential candidate? About 79% said lowering health care costs, 78% said improving the quality of health care, 72% said improving access to health care, and 63% said increasing funding for medical research.

Although a survey of some 1,000 adults may not be representative of all Americans, asking questions about what concerns the country is important, said Philip Alcabes, professor of community health at Hunter College of the City University of New York, who was not involved in the new survey.

“Ideally, our health policy is based on both the evidence about what real threats to Americans’ health exist and also what Americans are truly most worried about. … So, it makes perfect sense to ask these questions,” Alcabes said.

“What’s interesting but not surprising about the Mayo Clinic survey is the intensity of concern about the delivery of health care services. The cost, quality of care, access to care,” he said. “I don’t know how representative this is, but those are concerns that we hear in so many forums and from so many sectors of society, so it’s not surprising that that’s what emerges from this survey also.”",Cancer: The health condition that concerns Americans most

In the piece, Dr. Alison Shuman, a California-based pediatrician, asks whether or not small children are being vaccinated “too much, too soon.” Shuman, Chair of Pediatrics at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, says that contrary to popular belief, children are actually being exposed to far fewer foreign agents than their parents and grandparents had as children.

We have refined and improved our vaccines so much that our children today are even safer than we were. So when you worry about exposing your children to so many “more” things, don’t worry, you aren’t! You are exposing them to fewer antigens than all of us got. If you are wondering how many antigens are in certain vaccines, the hepatitis B, diphtheria and tetanus vaccines each contain just one antigen.

Essentially, children are receiving more vaccinations but far fewer antigens in those vaccinations. Here's what she says:

When we were children (70s, 80s and early 90s) we were vaccinated against fewer things (which were nonetheless still deadly). Let’s take the CDC’s vaccine schedule from 1983 for example. There were seven diseases we were protected against including measles, mumps, rubella, (MMR), Diptheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) and polio. Because of how vaccines were made at the time, we were exposed to about 3,000 antigens by the time we were 12 months old and 12,000 by the time we were 4 if we got all of our vaccines.

Antigens are basically any foreign material designed to trigger or stimulate your immune system. In vaccinations, these “foreign invaders” are weakened so human immune systems can easily overcome them and learn how to defend itself from whatever virus or bacteria one is being immunized for.

According to Shuman and the below chart provided by Scientific Parent, advances in the field of medicine have allowed medical professionals to combat twice as many diseases with just a fraction of the antigens.

Will this end the debates on vaccinations? Of course not. Nor should it. Putting foreign agents into our children is serious stuff, and open, inquiring minds can help us better understand what we’re putting into their bodies and why we’re doing it.

I know many people out there are passionate about this issue and know much more about it than I do. So I ask: Did Shuman miss anything or get something wrong? Did she change your mind?

Australians aren't actually going anywhere...the government is adjusting the discrepancy between maps and GPS data due to perpetual tectonic drift. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/australia-suddenly-move-north-new-years-day/,"Hold on tight, Australians – on New Year’s Day 2017, your entire country will jut northwards by 1.8 meters (5.9 feet). If, dear reader, you are now adorned with a doubt-infused frown, then you’ve probably clocked that this won’t be due to some apocalyptic shift in plate tectonics. Continental drift, however, does have a role to play in this geographic kerfuffle.

The Australian Plate is moving about 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) northwards every single year. This motion has accumulated over the decades to produce a significant discrepancy between local coordinates on maps and global coordinates in digital navigation systems used by satellites.

At present, this difference amounts to an error of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet). This is enough to cause a problem to anything in Australia that uses GPS-like systems, including smartphones and vehicles.

""If you want to start using driverless cars, accurate map information is fundamental,"" Dan Jaksa, a member of Geoscience Australia, told BBC News. “We have tractors in Australia starting to go around farms without a driver, and if the information about the farm doesn't line up with the coordinates coming out of the navigation system there will be problems.”

In order to stave off a grim future where autonomous tractors plough into helpless farm animals by mistake, the nation’s local coordinates will jump northwards at the start of next year. By 2020, the inexorable march of plate tectonics will catch up to the adjustment, and both the analogue and digital coordinate sets will match up for the first time since 1994, when the local coordinate system was last updated.

So as to stop this silliness happening again, a new as-of-yet unspecified system will be implemented in 2020 that will keep the two sets of coordinates matched in real-time. “Once we have a system that can deal with changes over time, then everybody in the world could be on that same system,” Jaksa added.

Australia was attached to Antarctica until around 85 million years ago, whereupon they began to initially rift apart. By 45 million years ago, 21 million years after the non-avian dinosaurs bit the dust, they had completely separated from each other. Although the Australian Plate initially fused with the Indian Plate, they have since become segregated, perhaps as little as 3 million years ago.

In 50 million years’ time, Australia will collide into the southeastern coast of China, eventually forming a brand new mountain range. It will be one of the earliest jigsaw pieces that will culminate in the formation of Pangaea Ultima, the next true supercontinent, 250 million years from now. By then, it’s likely that our coordinate technology would have moved on quite a bit.",Australia Will Suddenly Move 1.8 Meters North On New Year's Day
Reduction in brain size/grey matter. Remember correlation does not equal causation. ,http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/why-watching-too-much-porn-could-be-bad-for-the-brain-9458357.html,"Men who watch regularly pornography could be reducing the size of their brain, a study has found.

Researchers discovered less grey matter in the brains of men who regularly view pornography compared with those who don’t.

Experts say it’s the first evidence for a link between watching sexually explicit material and reductions in brain size – but the new study doesn’t prove that pornography causes changes to the brain.

They say an alternative explanation could be that men with a certain type of brain with overly-sensitive reward stimuli – known as the ‘striatum’ - could be more likely to use pornography.

Dr Simone Kühn from the Max Planck Institution in Berlin led the study. “Unfortunately we cannot answer this question based on the results of the present,” she said.

“It’s not clear, for example, whether watching porn leads to brain changes or whether people born with certain brain types watch more porn”.

Dr Kühn and colleagues from Berlin’s Charite University used 64 healthy men between the ages of 21 and 45 years and studied their porn-watching habits.

They matched their survey results with scans of the men’s brains and observed both the volume of the brain and the way they reacted to sexually explicit images.

The findings, published in the JAMA Psychiatry Journal, have been met with scepticism from some experts who say that watching pornography in moderation was probably not harmful.

Dr Gregory Tau from Columbia University said that porn-watching was “probably not terrible in moderation”.

“It is possible that there are individuals with a certain kind of brain that are more susceptible to these kinds of behaviours,” he said.

“Or, it’s possible it’s the excessive use (of porn) that’s perpetuating itself to causing brain changes. Or, it could be both.”

Dr Kühn has called for future studies to conduct deeper investigations into the effects of pornography on the brain over time.",Why watching too much porn could be bad for the brain
"Hormonally concentrated melanin. 
Article headline and photo emphasizes nipples, but the headline changes when shared on FB, emphasizing penis. Hm.",http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-are-nipples-darker-than-the-rest-of-the-skin-a6808631.html,"Perhaps it’s not be up there with life’s most important questions – what is the meaning of it all, why are we here? – but don’t pretend you haven’t ever wondered why some parts of your body are different colours.

Why, for example, are our nipples and genitals different colours to the rest of us? And does this serve any purpose?

The answers appears to be no, a dermatologist recently explained.

Dr Lindsey Bordone, a dermatologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York told the Mail Online that the change is down to a combination of two things: melanin and hormones.

When a human hits puberty, the spike in oestrogen and testosterone caused the body to create melanin – the amino acid which also gives the colour to our hair.

This makes the penis, nipples, areolas, and labia turn darker a darker colour.

The phenomenon is also why children who have blonde hair become brunettes as they grow older.

A woman’s skin can also become darker during pregnancy for similar reason, particularly around the areolas. Moles and freckles often become a more intense shade, while fewer women will experience chloasma which affects the forehead, cheeks and neck.

But Dr Bordone warned that darker skin is also a symptom of diabetes.

This condition is known as acanthosis nigricans, according to the American Diabetes Association, and sees a person developing darker areas on the sides of the neck, armpits and groin.

Looking at the star signs from a scientific standpoint.

A hospital in Argentina is reportedly using astrology to help treat some mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety, by giving patients an understanding of their astrological personalities. The guidance is given based on the patient’s sign — whether he or she is an Aries, Taurus, or so forth — and the leading astrologist develops a star chart for each patient.

Unsurprisingly, the astrology workshop is being met with criticism over its scientific validity.

Diego Andrés Golombek, a professor at the University of Quilmes in Argentina, told Quartz, “Astrology can be harmless, of course, unless it gives directions and instructions into how to proceed with, for example, an illness or medical treatment.”

SEE ALSO: 6 Questions to Ask Before Sharing Science on the Internet

“And, indeed, having such a program organized by a hospital leads into the completely false assumption that astrology might have some kind of scientific background which, of course, it completely lacks. I am horrified by this prospect!”

So, based on the evidence (or lack thereof), is there any real science to support astrology?

There are a few foundational ways to evaluate whether a concept is scientific, and the University of California, Berkeley’s Understanding Science website lays out a “Science checklist.”

1. Does astrology use testable ideas?

For something to have a true scientific basis, it has to encompass testable ideas. However, as Understanding Science explains, “Some expectations generated by astrology are so general that any outcome could be interpreted as fitting the expectations; if treated this way, astrology is not testable.”

2. Does it rely on evidence?

There haven’t been many studies that investigate the science behind astrology, but of the few that have, the results have failed to support the validity of astrological views. For instance, a study tested the accuracy of astrological charts in describing the personality traits of 193 study participants, and the results indicated that the scores were at a level consistent with chance.

So far, it can’t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence — and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself as valid.

3. Does it attempt to explain the natural world?

Yes, astrology’s basic premise is that the sun, moon, planets, and constellations have an effect on humans and earthly events. Further, it uses a set of rules about the relative positions and movements of the stars and planets to predict and explain worldly events and human personality.

However, as Understanding Science explains, “Although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid — and this is a key part of science.”

Plus, astrology doesn’t lead to ongoing research, which is another key part of science.

So, unfortunately for everyone who swears their daily horoscope is always on point or blames their stubbornness on being a Scorpio or a Taurus, it appears that there’s not much scientific evidence to back those claims. Until then, astrology will have to remain in the realm of pseudoscience.

Cat litter. ,http://www.iflscience.com/technology/theres-a-rather-unusual-way-to-fix-your-phone-if-youve-dunked-it-in-water/,"Dropping your phone into a fluid-carrying vessel, whether that be a swimming pool, a pond, or a (hopefully otherwise empty) toilet, is a profoundly irritating event, and one that many phones tend not to return intact from. There are normally two options at this point: sticking your phone in some rice, which can suck out the water, or swearing profusely and sulking.

According to phone company Gazelle, there is a third option, so long as you own a cat or kitten. No, despite their smarts, your feline companions themselves won’t be able to help you – in fact, they probably don’t care about your technological predicament. As it turns out, a specific type of cat litter is more effective at saving your phone from a watery death than rice.

In a post entitled “The Truth About Rice, the Galaxy and Everything,” which definitely oversells itself, Gazelle explains how its dedicated team of phone revivers purposefully drowned nine unfortunate smartphones before attempting to resurrect each one via different methods, including rice, instant oatmeal, pearly couscous, regular cat litter, and crystal kitty litter – the last of which is silica gel, the dehydrating agent found in little packets inside many electronics packages.

The company recommends that you shake as much of the water out of your phone first, allowing it to briefly air dry, then place it in a bag of crystal cat litter for as long as possible. They suggest that it takes several days for this to work, so the wait promises to be nail-biting.

If, however, your phone still isn’t operational 48 to 72 hours after the clumsiness occurred, then you may want to buy yourself a new phone.

"The sun is in a state of solar minimum where the amount of activity drops dramatically-- can even be devoid of features. On the other hand, when we can see sunspots, it's undergoing a solar maximum. This whole changing from maximum to minimum lasts for 11 years. ",http://www.iflscience.com/space/why-is-the-sun-blank/,"A new image of the Sun shows a rather strange occurrence – there are no visible features on the surface, indicating very little activity. Rather than signaling the end of times, though, this highlights a regular process taking place on our Solar System’s star.

The Sun goes through cycles of activity lasting 11 years, moving from a solar maximum to a solar minimum. During a maximum, the Sun is at its most active, with sunspots – dark areas of magnetic activity – occurring frequently across the surface, several hundred per year. Often, these can be accompanied by bursts of material called coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The exact cause of solar cycles is not fully understood.

During a solar minimum, the amount of activity drops dramatically. And, in some instances, the Sun can be devoid of any noticeable features at all. That’s the case in this latest image, taken on June 4 by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). As highlighted by meteorologist Paul Dorian at Vencore Weather, this was part of a quiet spell that lasted for about four days. This suggests we are heading towards the next solar minimum, predicted to take place around 2020.

“The blank sun is a sign that the next solar minimum is approaching and there will be an increasing number of spotless days over the next few years,” writes Dorian. “At first, the blankness will stretch for just a few days at a time, then it’ll continue for weeks at a time, and finally it should last for months at a time when the sunspot cycle reaches its nadir.”

Here's what the Sun looks like with sunspots on the surface, taken from July 24 to August 1, 2012. NASA/SDO/HMI

This cycle is called Solar Cycle 24, being the 24th observed since sunspot activity was first recorded in 1755. Dorian also said this is the weakest cycle in more than a century, since Solar Cycle 14 in 1906.

In this 24th cycle, solar maximum was reached in April 2014, and the next maximum is not expected until the 2020s. Despite some claims to the contrary, though, this solar minimum is very natural – and it’s not about to cause a “mini ice age”. Perhaps the most noticeable change during a solar minimum is an increase in cosmic rays making their way to Earth.

During high activity, the Sun usually protects Earth from cosmic rays – originating from things like supernovas – thanks to its solar storms. But during lesser activity, cosmic rays can more easily enter the Solar System, and could pose a threat to the health of astronauts.

At any rate, we’ve survived solar cycles before, and this one will be no different. Still, this latest picture is pretty interesting to look at.

They're not. It's the unexpectedness of finding an unusual object beside them that they find frightening. ,http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/cats-are-completely-terrified-cucumbers-why/,"Cats are deeply curious creatures. Recent evidence suggests that these tiny lions see us as inessential landlords, or rubbish, fur-lacking kittens. A new internet craze involving our feline companions has unveiled another piece of strange information: For some utterly bizarre reason, they appear to be terrified – utterly terrified – of cucumbers.

In the vast majority of the videos, cat owners are seen sneaking up behind their pets as they’re facing the other way – mostly eating – and placing the green, elongated vegetable behind them. As the cat turns around and spots the unexpected item, it loses its mind, leaps into the air, and gets away from it as fast as it can. In some videos, the cats then engage in a stare down with the cucumber, waiting in vain for it to make its first move.

But the question remains: Why on Earth are cats frightened by these innocuous vegetables?

To be fair, there aren’t any videos of cats seeing a cucumber from a distance and then walking up to interrogate it, so perhaps it’s the unexpected sight of a cucumber behind them that’s frightening, not the cucumber itself: An unexpected pineapple would likely be just as jarring. As it turns out, Dr. Roger Mugford, a specialist in animal behavior, told the Telegraph: “I think that the reaction is due to the novelty and unexpectedness of finding an unusual object secretly placed whilst their heads were down in the food bowl.”

Cats are shown to be suspicious of anything that moves rapidly, makes a lot of noise, or lights up erratically: essentially, anything that they don’t fully understand, which isn’t really that different from most animals, including humans. It’s also worth noting that cats are mostly solitary animals, and humans are as sociable as animals can be – so they’re baffled enough by us as it is. Freaking them out with unexpected cucumbers probably isn’t helping.

“Cats have to be suspicious of the unknown: It could represent the danger of a snake or another predator,” Mugford continued. “I suspect that there would be the same reaction to a model spider, a plastic fish or a human face mask.”

Well, there’s only one way to find out. This is, after all, for science. Get your model spiders at the ready.",Why Are Cats So Insanely Afraid Of Cucumbers?

Despite bromelain being an approved anti-inflammatory treatment and having other health benefits, when it comes into contact with the sensitive skin in and around one's mouth, it's actually breaking down proteins, causing the tissue to become sore and inflamed.

So your favorite fruit is essentially eating your mouth. Yes, we're being dramatic. But you get the point.",Why Does Eating Pineapple Make Your Mouth Sore?
"Give it some head. A layer of small bubbles insulates the beer from air exposure (which degrades the taste over time) and leads to a ""creamy mouthfeel — like a draft."".",http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/a-cure-for-cheap-beer/62256,"Open the fridge, grab a frosty one, pop off the cap and enjoy. That’s the ritual performed countless times a day by us beer drinkers. And we’re all doing it wrong.

At least, that’s what Philip Petracca, co-founder of New Hampshire-based Fizzics, believes. His company’s mission is to give every one of us the “perfect pour.” How? With a home beer tap machine that uses science to improve the drinking experience, regardless of the brand. The secret to making any beer taste better is in getting a better head, Petracca claims. Beer in cans, bottles or barrels contains a lot of dissolved CO2 under pressure, he says, and when improperly handled it can cause bubbles and foam to overflow or improperly foam.

So, if the bubbles are too big — a common result of a hand-pour — our mouths perceive a “grainy” feel, which can lead many a beer drinker to avoid pouring heads altogether. But that’s a mistake, according to Petracca. Not only does the head insulate the rest of the beer from flavor-robbing oxygen (even a few minutes of air exposure can degrade the taste), but it can also help seal in the gases that give beer its effervescence, something that likewise maximizes flavor.

… produces a head with small, perfectly formed bubbles, which delivers a creamy mouthfeel — like a draft.

The Fizzics machine, which is about the size of a small kitchen appliance, produces a head with small, perfectly formed bubbles, which delivers a creamy mouthfeel — like a draft. Here’s how it works. Place a bottle, can or growler (a reusable container for transporting draft beer) — the Fizzics machine doesn’t care — inside its sealed chamber. Pull forward on the silver tap handle to pressurize the chamber, which forces the beer out of its original container and into your glass via a small plastic tube. The magic happens toward the end of the pour, when you push the tap handle backward. This action kick-starts the patented agitation process, which turns the remaining drops of liquid into an ultra-smooth head, using sound waves. There are no gas cylinders or other consumables needed — just four AA batteries.

Steve Abrams, co-founder of Canada’s Mill Street Brewery, agrees a good beer head improves the taste of a brew considerably, noting that in Europe, bartenders will often take extra time to “layer” your beer as it’s poured. Though he hasn’t tried the Fizzics, Abrams has encountered “lots of beer gadgets,” even one that lets you pour a beer with your mind. He says the Fizzics could indeed improve a beer’s taste, as long as it’s served cold. But some might find the selling price of $150 (they start shipping in October) a bit steep. Petracca defends the cost, pointing out that when compared to a night at a bar, “it’s not expensive at all, if experiences and social connections are important.”

Perhaps it’s a nice idea for a gift, but Abrams points out that “pouring beer into a glass is not rocket science,” and offers up this video for those who need a quick 101 on the technique. Rocket science or not, the Fizzics would certainly make a good conversation piece. To that, we say, “Cheers!”",A Cure for Cheap Beer?
"They tend to live longer. However, it's not necessarily the act of having a child later in life that causes longevity, but that the bodies of women who can support healthy pregnancies later in life tend to age slower. ",http://www.ozy.com/acumen/late-kids-long-life/32804?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=US,"Because if you are able to have kids later in life, you might be wired to live longer, too.

Attention, 30-something single ladies: If you’re tired of people dropping not-so-subtle hints about having kids while you still have the eggs and energy, you can (probably, politely) tell them to back off.

A Boston University School of Medicine study found that women who can still give birth naturally after age 33 have a higher chance of living to extreme old age than those who had their last child before age 30. But the report, published in the online version of the journal Menopause in April 2014 doesn’t imply that putting off pregnancy will add years to your life. “If you physically delay having children, that’s not going to help with longevity, Paola Sebastiani, a Boston University biostatistics professor and study co-author, told OZY. A woman with a natural ability to have children later in life suggests that her body – including her reproductive system – just happens to age at a slow pace. Some women’s biological clocks simply tick more slowly than most.

Women who had their last child after 33 were twice as likely to live to 95 or older, compared with those who had their last child by 29.

Sebastiani and her colleagues analyzed data from the Long Life Family Study, a survey of 551 families, many of whose members lived to a ripe old age. They determined the ages at which 462 women had their last child and how long they ended up living. Turns out women who gave birth to their last child after 33 were twice as likely to live to 95 years or older, compared with those who had their last child by age 29.

The researchers suspect that the former group’s DNA might harbor genetic variants that slow aging and lower the risk for age-related diseases that can hamper fertility (like ovarian cancer or diabetes). Women with such variants could presumably bear children for a longer period of time, boosting their chances of passing these genes down to future generations — meaning we may have women to thank for the evolution of longevity genes. It could also explain why of the people who live to be 100 or older, 85% are women, compared to only 15% of men.

Earlier studies have unearthed similar insights. Take the ongoing New England Centenarian Study, which found that women who had children after 40 were a whopping four times more likely to live to 100 than women who had their last child at a younger age.

Given the possible link between longevity and a longer fertility window, Sebastiani’s findings also suggest that researchers should further investigate the genetic influences of reproductive fitness, since they might also affect aging rates and vulnerability to age-related diseases. Sebastiani and her team have been working to identify the genetic variants that make some women age slower and plan to publish their results at the end of this year. Understanding the pathways they govern could help scientists develop drugs that produce the same effect.

So even if your biological clock is ticking, it might still be a while before its alarm goes off — depending on your genes.","Late Kids, Long Life?"

"They were at a motivational seminar led by Tony Robbins (not the first time this has happened at his seminars) yet only 40 of 7000 participants were burned, likely because they were stopping on the coals to take videos and selfies. ",https://gizmodo.com/40-people-got-burned-firewalking-in-texas-for-the-dumbe-1782559421,"Around 40 people attending a seminar with motivational speaker Tony Robbins in downtown Dallas yesterday were injured when a group exercise involving walking across hot coals went wrong. And it’s not the first time this has happened: back in 2012, for instance, 21 people in San Jose were burned after attempting the stunt at another Robbins seminar.

People got burned walking across hot coals, you say? There’s a shocker. But the Dallas seminar had over 7000 participants, most of whom completed the fire walking ceremony without injury. Why did most of those people walk across the coals safely while a (relative) handful got burned?

The Robbins camp might say they just didn’t believe in themselves enough to fully unleash the power within, but it actually has everything to do with physics. As I wrote back in 2012, it is quite possible to firewalk safely. A physics professor at the University of Pittsburgh named David Willey does it all the time, thanks to his grasp of the underlying physics.

This is well-established science. The key factors at play are the low thermal conductivity of the burning wood-turned-to-coal, an insulating layer of ash, and the short time of contact between the hot coals and the soles of the feet.

In particular, the coals must burn down to around 1000 degrees Fahrenheit, preferably with a thin layer of ash providing extra insulation. This also burns off excess water, which increases the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the coals.

And while it’s tempting to want to run across hot coals, this actually pushes your feet deeper into the embers, increasing the burn risk. A nice steady walking pace is best. (Some say wetting your feet beforehand can add protection via the Leidenfrost effect, but Willey has found the effects of this to be negligible and prefers to firewalk dry-footed.)

Back in 1998, Willey and Kjetil Kjernsmo of University of Oslo developed a computer model of a fire walker’s foot, and then compared it to infrared imagery of people fire walking in Seattle. Those images showed that the foot really does remain cool when the stunt is done correctly.

“[T]here was someone in front of us and someone behind us on their cell phone, taking selfies and taking pictures.”

So what went wrong in Dallas? Probably the same thing that happened at the 2012 San Jose seminar. You have to set up a scientific experiment correctly to get the best results, and for something like fire walking there’s not much margin for error. Those who got burned probably lingered just a bit too long on the hot coals, the better to, say, snap a selfie of their moment of enlightenment.

That seems to be borne out by witness statements. “From my observation, there was someone in front of us and someone behind us on their cell phone, taking selfies and taking pictures,” Jacqueline Luxemberg, a participant who did the firewalk and emerged unscathed, told WFAA. “[She asked others] to video record for her, so I think that that has a lot to do with it.”

So should you ever decide to attempt a fire walking stunt yourself, remember: walk (don’t run), make sure the coals have burned down sufficiently, don’t wet your feet beforehand, and try not to strike too long a pose for that selfie. Oh, and have some ice and Vicodin handy, just in case.

"It's a red, snow-dwelling algae that causes glaciers to melt more quickly. ",https://gizmodo.com/this-pink-snow-does-not-bode-well-for-our-future-1782421694?utm_campaign=socialflow_io9_facebook&utm_source=io9_facebook&utm_medium=socialflow,"Your first thought on seeing this weird pink snow might be an industrial accident or a nearby Big Foot massacre. Rest assured, it’s neither—just a perfectly natural, snow-dwelling algae. So, why are scientists all in a tizzy about it? Because it’s causing glaciers to melt faster.

Advertisement

That’s the startling conclusion of a study just published in Nature Communications that which suggests we may have seriously underestimated the ability of tiny red algae to screw with Earth’s ice caps. And their so-called “bio-albedo” feedback is only expected to grow as the planet warms up.

Red snow algae have been described all over the world in polar and alpine settings from Greenland and Antarctica to Iceland and the European Alps. In the winter, they lie dormant in the snow as spores. But in the late spring and summer, when their icy habitat begins to melt, they blossom to produce striking pink landscapes.

Now, a sweeping analysis of red snow algae across 21 glaciers in the pan-European Arctic shows that these tiny critters are actually helping the snow melt faster.

The reason has to do with a simple climate-altering process known as the albedo effect. You’ve probably heard about how glaciers keep our planet cool by reflecting sunlight. As glaciers melt, they give way to darker land or ocean surfaces—surfaces with a lower albedo. This causes the Earth to absorb more sunlight and heat up even more.

Turns out, red snow algae have a non-trivial effect on the albedo of the snowy surfaces they colonize, reducing it by as much as 13 percent, according to the new study. And while it’s still unclear just how large these blooms can get, lead study author Steffi Lutz of the University of Leeds says they can be quite widespread in the Arctic by summertime.

Advertisement

“Based on personal observations, a conservative estimate would be 50 percent of the snow surface on a glacier at the end of a melt season,” she told Gizmodo in an email. “But this can potentially be even higher.”



This makes red snow algae an unaccounted mechanism in the long list of reasons the Arctic is melting like a popsicle in a microwave. Lutz and her colleagues are now working to estimate how much glacial melt red snow algae are actually responsible for. They’re also hoping to incorporate the colorful critters into future global climate models.

Advertisement

What’s worrisome is that even if red snow algae have a small influence on Arctic ice cover today, their role is likely to grow as human carbon emissions warm the planet.

Advertisement

“The algae need liquid water in order to bloom,” Lutz said. “Therefore the melting of snow and ice surfaces controls the abundance of the algae. The more melting, the more algae. With temperatures rising globally, the snow algae phenomenon will likely also increase leading to an even higher bio-albedo effect.”

It’s yet another reminder that microbes are pulling the strings around here much more than we humans tend to appreciate. And that even as Miami drowns, some creatures will thrive in the hotter future.

Well, you may be right, according to a new study.

Cats, dogs, and other mammals are thought to see in ultraviolet light, which opens up a whole different world than the one we see, the study explains.

Seeing the World in Ultraviolet (UV) Light

UV light is the wave length beyond the visible light from red to violet that humans can see. Humans have a lens that blocks UV from reaching the retina. It was previously thought that most mammals have lenses similar to humans.

Scientists studied the lenses of dead mammals, including cats, dogs, monkeys, pandas, hedgehogs, and ferrets. By researching how much light passes through the lens to reach the retina, they concluded that some mammals previously thought not to be able to see UV actually can.

""Nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet, but in fact, they do,"" Ron Douglas, the study leader and a biologist at City University London, England, told LiveScience.

What purpose does being able to see UV light serve for animals such as reindeer, rodents, and other mammals? It allows reindeer to see polar bears, for example, which are nearly invisible in regular light because they blend in with the snow.

UV light also allows mammals to see urine trails. This would be helpful for predator animals, such as cats and dogs, to find food in the wild.

"Fungicides, disinfectants, plant-growth regulators, and fluoride. ",http://ethicalfoods.com/sprayed-produce-harvest/,"Are chemicals added to fresh fruits and vegetables after harvest?

We know that processed foods often contain a host of unhealthy additives, from fake flavors and colors to chemical preservatives. What you don’t know is that sometimes chemicals are added to fresh produce after it’s picked and before it gets to the grocery store.

When you buy an apple, a bag of potatoes or an orange, you’re probably under the impression that these fresh fruits and vegetables have only been washed clean before being stacked neatly in the produce section.

In addition to the chemicals used to grow produce, there are a host of post harvest chemicals and colorants applied: in the field, in washing water, in transport, in storage and in packaging. Unlike processed foods, there is no label on fresh food that tells us what they are.

Commonly used chemicals

Sodium orthophenylphenate (SOPP)

How it’s used: Fungicide which prevents or delays the appearance of rota and molds on produce.

Thiabendazole (TBZ)

How it’s used: Thiabendazole is used as a fungicide to control green mold, blue mold, and stem end rot on citrus fruits. It controls Cercospora leaf spot on sugar beets; crown rot on bananas; bluemold rot, bully eye rot, and gray mold on apples and pears; black rot, scurf and foot rot on sweet potatoes; and to control Fusarium (dry rot) in potato storage. It can be used on soybeans to reduce the severity of pod and stem blight such as anthracnose, brown spot, frogeye leaf spot and purple stain.

Sodium hypochlorite

How it’s used: The active ingredient of most liquid household bleaches, sodium hypochlorite is commonly used when the scale of postharvest chlorination is limited. It is used in postharvest management as an algicide, disinfectant, and sanitizer.

Sodium hypochlorite is an approved chemical for use in organic postharvest systems by under the USDA National Organic Program (NOP) Rule.

Maleic hydrazide

How it’s used: The compound is used to inhibit sprouting in potatoes, onions and carrots in storage, to induce dormancy in citrus fruits and as a plant-growth regulator to control growth of tobacco, potatoes, onions, non-bearing citrus, beans, beets, corn, lima beans, peas, strawberries, sugar beets, garlic and tomatoes.

In Austria and Denmark, use of maleic hydrazide is banned.

Sulfuryl fluoride

In January 2011, the EPA—prompted by a joint petition from the Fluoride Action Network (FAN), Environmental Working Group (EWG) and Beyond Pesticides—proposed the phase out of sulfuryl fluoride. The Pest Free Food Supply Act seeks to prevent the proposed phaseout of sulfuryl fluoride from taking effect. In 2014, the use of sulfuryl fluoride’s use in food production was protected, and it is still being applied on harvests.

How it’s used: fumigant applied to stored crops after harvest, leaving significant amounts of fluoride on treated foods. It is a substitute for the post-harvest crop storage uses of the pesticide methyl bromide.

Fluoride is neurotoxic. Over 30 published studies have reported an association between fluoride and reduced IQ in children, animal studies show that the brain is the main target for sulfuryl fluoride’s effects, and fumigation workers who use sulfuryl fluoride have been found to suffer impaired cognitive function. There is a growing consensus that American children are exposed to too much fluoride, in part because of the use of sulfuryl fluoride.

Sulfuryl fluoride is a potent greenhouse gas. Because of this, the Sierra Club, Center for Environmental Health, Defenders of Wildlife, and Center for Biological Diversity oppose efforts to expand sulfuryl fluoride production.

How are chemicals used post harvest?



Fungicides which prevent or delay the appearance of rota and molds in the product.

Examples are, sodium orthophenylphenate (SOPP), thiabendazole (TBZ), sodium hypochlorite, and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Methyl formate (Erinol), ethyl formate and (in some countries) ethylene oxide are frequently applied to dried fruits to kill infestations of insects and molds.

Sulphur dioxide, benzoic acid, propionic acid, ascorbic acid and sorbic acid are added to processed fruit products, especially juices, to inhibit the growth of yeasts and molds.

Chemicals that delay ripening or senescence.

Examples are: the kinins and kinetins that delay chlorophyll degradation and senescence in leafy vegetables; gibberellins that retard the ripening of tomatoes and hold citrus fruits on the tree beyond normal maturity; and auxins that delay deterioration of oranges and green beans.

Growth retardants that inhibit sprouting and growth.

Examples are maleic hydrazide which is applied pre-harvest and inhibits sprouting in a number of stored commodities, e.g., onions and potatoes. A number of chemicals are applied post-harvest to potatoes to control sprouting, for example, CIPC, TCNB and MENA.

Daminozide (Alar) increases fruit firmness, color and encourages early maturation in apples.

Chemicals that hasten ripening and senescence.

Examples are ethylene and compounds such as Ephephon that release ethylene, abscisin, ascorbic acid, ß hydroxyethyl hydrazine (BOH), acetylene and substances that release acetylene such as calcium carbide, and certain alcohols and fatty acids.

Chemicals that may hasten or delay ripening and senescence depending on the dose and the commodity on which they are used.

Examples are 2, 4-D; 2,4, 5-T; indoleacetic acid (IAA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA).

Metabolic inhibitors that block certain biochemical reactions that normally occur.

Examples are cycloheximide, actinomycin D, vitamin K, maleic acid, ethylene oxide, and carbon monoxide.

Fumigants to control insects or sometimes molds. Ethylene dibromide and methyl bromide are the most commonly used fumigants.

Coloring. The use of artificial colors is sometimes permitted in order to improve the appearance of a fruit.

For example, an orange may have artificial color added to the skin for cosmetic purposes.

Food additives. A number of compounds are permitted to be added to processed produce as preservatives, to alter texture or for cosmetic purposes.

The major preservatives are sulphur dioxide, benzoic acid or benzoates, and sorbic acid or sorbates.

Functional additives include antioxidants, coloring, flavoring, thickeners, emulsifiers, etc.

In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has the responsibility for registering agricultural chemicals and pesticides, and setting tolerances. The situation may be quite different in developing countries where governments usually do not have the expertise or analytical laboratories to monitor adequately the use of post-harvest chemicals on perishable crops. Something to think about when buying imported fresh produce.

"Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-just-discovered-where-hiv-began,"Diseases, while disastrous, often come and go in the public eye. We hear about ebola, but then another one quickly grabs national monitors and TV screens for its fifteen minutes.

However, one condition that seems to not fit into his norm is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

The spread of HIV is a story that would have most television dramas pale in comparison - combining elements of intrigue, suspense, and mystery into one cohesive nightmare that has blanketed the globe since the 1920s.

It all began in Kinshasha, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, in the 1920s, it was better known as the Belgian colony of Leopoldville.

A high profile location for young men to sojourn to in hopes of making a fortune, as it was the capital of Belgian Congo. Therefore, with them came railroads and sex workers.

Two forms of transportation that respectively spread people and infection. With a flourishing location, HIV found many opportunities to grow into the pandemic it is today.

The irony of it all is that HIV-1 group M, the type of HIV that originated in the colony, is responsible for about 90 percent of all infections, while HIV-1 group O, another type of HIV originating nearby is still quietly confined to West Africa.

Thereby suggesting it may have been the opportunities, and not the function, of that disease that enabled it to roar globally.

""Ecological rather than evolutionary factors drove its rapid spread,"" says Nuno Faria at the University of Oxford in the UK, in an interview with the BBC.

Faria and his colleagues were able to make this determination after they built a family tree of HIV by looking at a host of HIV genomes collected from about 800 infected people from central Africa.

Notably, by comparing two genome sequences and counting the differences in them, the team was able to figure out when the two last shared a common ancestor.

Ultimately, Faria determined that the HIV genomes all shared a common ancestor... one that existed no more than 100 years ago. To that end, they assert that it all likely began around 1920.

And with this information, they were able to place the virus to a specific city of origin - Kinshasa, which is now the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

All in all, the genetic assays that helped us localise the origin of the disease are still underway to help us identify points of public health intervention that may help us reduce the spread of the infection. Because, although we may know where it came from, we have yet to figure out where it will end.

"The Great Pyramid inspired awe and scientific inquiry at the geometric perfection of its construction. However, the west face is about 5.5 inches longer at the base than the east. ",http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-great-pyramid-of-giza-is-slightly-wonky/,"The Great Pyramid of Giza is so seemingly well-built that explanations of how the ancient Egyptians constructed it over 4,500 years ago have been filled with controversy, confusion, and mysticism. And sometimes even aliens. However, according to a new study, the engineering behind it might not be as bang-on as we once thought.

The study by the Glen Dash Research Foundation and the Ancient Egypt Research Associates has discovered that the Great Pyramid doesn’t have a perfectly square base, with one particularly lopsided west-facing edge.

Engineer Glen Dash and Egyptologist Mark Lehner looked for the original edges to the 138-meter (455 feet) tall Great Pyramid of Giza, the largest of the three pyramids found in Giza, just across the River Nile from Egypt's capital, Cairo.

When it was first constructed, under the rule of Pharaoh Khufu, the pyramid was lined with a white limestone casing. Over the centuries, this outer casing was stripped for use in other building projects and left the pyramid how we see it now. Much of this outer edge is too damaged to be of any use, however, the researchers managed to pinpoint 84 points of the original boundary around the pyramid’s 920-meter (3,020 feet) periphery.

Using this data they plotted out the lengths of the pyramid's four sides. The east side measured between 230.295 to 230.373 meters (755.561 to 755.817 feet) in length. However, the west side was around 230.378 to 230.436 meters (755.833 and 756.024 feet). That means the west side could be more than 14 centimeters (5.5 inches) longer than the east.

So, not too bad considering it was built 4,500 years ago. As the researchers say in the study “The data show that the Egyptians possessed quite remarkable skills for their time… We can only speculate as to how the Egyptians could have laid out these lines with such precision using only the tools they had.”

Scientists love a good mystery, and the oceans of the world – being massive, deep, dark, and inherently enigmatic places – are literally full of them. The latest conundrum comes courtesy of the Caribbean Sea, wherein a very low-pitch sound, one well beyond the hearing range of humans, can be heard. In fact, something down there is so huge and mobile that it's generating waves in Earth’s gravitational field.

A team of researchers, led by the University of Liverpool (UL), were in the middle of conducting an expedition to the Atlantic Ocean-based Caribbean Sea, which covers an area of roughly 2,754,000 square kilometers (1,063,000 square miles). Their original objective was to study the dynamic sea currents within the basin, which links up to the Gulf Stream, critical for delivering heat to, among other places, Western Europe.

Writing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the authors describe how their instrumentation picked up something they describe as a “whistle”. The note itself is an A-flat.

So far, it’s squished everything from bowling balls to non-Newtonian fluid . But now they must face nature's hardest substance: diamond.

The diamond was donated to the channel by a generous diamond retailer looking to jump on the viral bandwagon. As stated in the video, it’s a 1.2 carat jewel and worth at least $4,000, complete with its own certificate to prove it’s the real deal.

So, as Lauri Vuohensilta – the mad genius behind the channel – says in the video: “They say diamonds are forever, but how long?”

As it turns out, not very long.

So, how was the diamond broken so easily? As some have pointed out, the “hardness” that diamonds are known for only really refers to their ability to be scratch-resistant. While the covalent bonds between the diamond atoms themselves are extremely strong, diamonds can also be brittle, especially if there’s any kind of defect or it’s been poorly cut. Scientists have even discovered materials that are actually harder than diamonds, such as wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite.

Usually this was because, as we know, she had some memory issues.

But even though Dory was able to work through her worry (thanks to her “just keep swimming” mantra), Finding Nemo and its upcoming sequel, Finding Dory, has some marine biologists pretty worried, according to an article in The Wrap. After Finding Nemo, people everywhere wanted to have a little Nemo for themselves. The original movie’s popularity led to a 40% rise in the sale of clownfish everywhere. But that wasn’t too much of an issue since clownfish can be safely bred in captivity and do ok in personal tanks.

But Dory is no clownfish. She’s a blue tang fish, which are much rarer than clownfish and don’t do nearly as well in tanks. If Finding Dory leads to the same demand for blue tang fish that Finding Nemo did for clown fish, there could be some problems. Blue tang fish are found in areas around Indonesia and the Philippines, where there aren’t very many rules or regulations about large-scale fish collection. This means, if there’s too much demand for these fish as pets, there’s nothing really stopping people from going out and gathering lots of them (and majorly destroying ecosystems in the process).

"70% of people tested had no negative effects to their cholesterol, for the other 30% the ""issue was fairly benign"". The rest of the article talks about nutritional benefits of eggs from eyesight to weight control. ",http://remedydaily.com/2016/02/26/the-health-benefits-of-eating-eggs/?src=bottomxpromo&ro=1&xs=48835_49767_0_4578bc8f758114170b613181e7eaf534&eid=48835&pid=48835,"Eggs, like some other foods, have gotten a bit of a bad rap over the years, with numerous findings reporting that eggs can be chiefly responsible for high levels of cholesterol. However, the truth of the matter is altogether different. In fact, not only is the cholesterol statement erroneous, eggs actually have many varied — and essential — benefits for your body.

Because the average large egg contains between 180 and 186 milligrams of cholesterol, just one immediately counts for over half of your recommended daily intake, the Huffington Post reports. However, it's a little more complicated than that: It turns out cholesterol is actually already being produced, in rather significant amounts, by your body – 1 to 2 grams each day on average. But when you consume foods that contain cholesterol, your body's production of the substance decreases to make up for it. You don't really add cholesterol to existing amounts, you're replacing one kind with another.

Authority Nutrition makes another excellent point: While cholesterol has negative connotations for obvious reasons, it is not a purely harmful molecule. Cholesterol is a vital part of the body, and is essential in creating testosterone, estrogen and cortisol. The website also reports a study where a group of individuals took to eating one to three whole eggs a day. For 70 percent of those people, eggs did not negatively affect cholesterol levels. For the remaining 30 percent, the issue was fairly benign as well: Eggs were found to change LDL cholesterol (the harmful variety) from small, dense molecules to larger ones, which made them a lot less of a threat. One damper on the good news, however: Eggs are found to cause an increased risk of heart disease in diabetics, Authority Nutrition says.

Now that we've dispelled most of the negative preconceptions about eggs, let's explore the advantages to their regular consumption:

1. Nutrients

Shutterstock

Eggs are rich in several different types of nutrients, according to the Huffington Post: They're rich in vitamins A, D, E and B-12, as well as iron, folate, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, among others, all of which are extremely important.

2. Protein

Shutterstock

Eggs provide the highest-quality protein, with a much higher rating than milk or beef. You'd need about 30 grams of meat to equate to a single egg, which is much less expensive.

3. Choline

Shutterstock

Choline, a nutrient you don't frequently hear about, is nonetheless very important for the brain. It helps promote growth and memory function. Choline supplements are especially crucial for pregnant mothers, where most of the woman's choline supplies will be sent to her child and she will be left with a critically low amount. 90 percent of people are lacking in choline. Eggs contain plenty of this nutrient.

4. Eyesight

Shutterstock

Eggs are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that gather in the eye region and protect your eyes from dangerous light wavelengths, as well as lower the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.

5. Weight control

Shutterstock

Eggs help with satiety, meaning they make you feel fuller than many other foods. People who start the day with some eggs in their breakfast feel much less hungry throughout the day, which allows them to take smaller meals.

6. Bones, hair and nails

The vitamin D and calcium mentioned previously are of great importance for the bones, helping them grow stronger. Eggs help prevent osteoporosis this way. In addition, the amino acids and minerals in eggs promote healthier hair and nails, the website says.

So should you eat three eggs a day? Authority Nutrition recommends it, saying the benefits are much stronger than the downsides. But ""Today"" reports such an intake in eggs can lead to carotid plaque buildup in the arteries, as well as an increased risk in heart attack and stroke due to the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide, a somewhat harmful chemical.

The Huffington Post suggests varying up your diet a bit, stating three eggs a day can be a bit much. However, there's clearly no reason not to enjoy more than one of these a day – especially if you prefer free-range eggs to the supermarket variety, which has been found to provide a lot less nutrients.

Yes. It's a natural uranium ore deposit that was discovered in 1972. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/there-really-ancient-nuclear-reactor-africa/,"An ancient nuclear reactor that was churning away 2 billion years ago sounds like a myth. Maybe it's because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure. But in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the Earth's crust, found in Okla, Gabon. Uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions.

The natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. The pile of rock in the ground in Okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago!

It was discovered in 1972, when some French scientists took uranium ore from the mine in Gabon to test its uranium content. Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions.

One would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium.",Is There Really A 2 Billion-Year-Old Nuclear Reactor In Africa?
"An inconclusive study shows that heavy, daily marijuana use may affect the reward centers of the brain in a manner similar to addiction. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-something-strange-when-they-looked-at-the-brains-of-pot-smokers,"Marijuana's official designation as a Schedule 1 drug – something with ""no accepted medical use"" – means it is pretty tough to study. Yet numerous anecdotal reports, as well as some studies, have linked marijuana with several purported health benefits, from pain relief to helping with certain forms of epilepsy.

Still, experts say more rigorous scientific analyses are needed. Use of marijuana, a psychoactive drug, can come with risks, especially in people who may be prone to addiction or mental illness. And now, for the first time, researchers have found a link between daily decade-long weed use and a difference in how the brain processes reward.

For years, researchers have suggested that such a link exists – and if it does, that it could play a powerful role in addiction. An important part of this line of thought is that addicts, far from amoral individuals incapable of making intelligent decisions, simply respond differently to drugs – neurologically, psychologically, physiologically – than people who are not addicted.

And this response is probably the result of many factors outside the person's control, including genetics, behaviour, and environment.

So for their study, published on Wednesday in the journal Human Brain Mapping, researchers at the Centre for BrainHealth at the University of Texas, Dallas, took a look at the brains of 53 daily long-term pot users (14 of whom met the American Psychiatric Association's criteria for addiction) and 68 people who'd never used the drug daily.

Then the researchers showed them a series of objects meant to test their reward response. The objects included one type of fruit (the ""natural cue""), a pencil (the ""neutral cue""), and either a bong, a pipe, or a joint (the ""cannabis cue""), depending on which one the participant said they preferred.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP/File

Importantly, this study did not look at so-called recreational users – those who use the drug every few weeks or months. Instead, it focused on people who used the drug every day for an average of 12 years, several of whom met the criteria for being addicted to the drug, and many of whom displayed some signs of past or present problems with weed.

Why? Because the researchers wanted to tease out how changes to the brain's reward pathway might affect those who used the drug every day for years – and, more importantly, why.

Not surprisingly, when the chronic users were presented with either the bong, pipe, or joint, they displayed a stronger response in several parts of their brain linked with reward than they did when they were shown the fruit cues.

In contrast, the non-users did not show a significantly greater response to either the weed or fruit cues, and some parts of their brains showed a greater response to the fruit than to the bong, pipe, or joint.

""We found that marijuana disrupts the brain's natural reward circuitry, making marijuana highly salient to heavy users,"" Francesca Filbey, the director of cognitive neuroscience research of addictive disorders at the Centre for BrainHealth and an associate professor in the School of Behavioural and Brain Sciences, told Business Insider.

""In essence, these brain alterations could be a marker of transition from recreational marijuana use to problematic use,"" she said.

The orbitofrontal cortex, highlighted in green.

Marijuana and the brain

In another 2014 study also by Filbey, she and her team found that, compared with people who didn't use pot, long-term, heavy users tended to have a smaller orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region critical for processing emotions and making decisions.

And, interestingly enough, the heavy users also appeared to have more cross-brain connections. Scientists think regular users may develop these links as a means of compensating for the difference in size. The regular pot users also had lower IQ scores overall when compared with the people who didn't use the drug.

To arrive at their results – one of the first comprehensive, 3D pictures of the brains of adults who'd smoked weed at least four times a week, often multiple times a day, for years – the researchers used a combination of MRI-based brain scans.

Still, that study did not show that chronic weed use caused certain regions of the brain to shrink, or that pot use caused lower IQ scores – it simply showed a relationship among those factors.

""We cannot honestly say that that is what's happening here,"" Filbey told Business Insider in 2014.

Similarly, the latest study does not show that chronic pot use causes a change in the brain's reward response; the reverse could also be true, that the changed reward response influenced the chronic pot use.

"No. It's a panorama camera glitch paired with ""psychological priming"" since the hotel advertises itself as being haunted and is the location of the filming of ""The Shining"". ",http://www.livescience.com/54462-mysterious-figure-stanley-hotel-is-ghost-glitch.html,"A visitor to a famous—and famously haunted—hotel in Colorado claims to have captured a ghostly image.

According to a CNN story, ""Tourist Henry Yau recently took a picture at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which appears to show two ghostly apparitions standing on a staircase.

In the photo, a woman can be seen at the top of the stairs in a period outfit with a child beside her."" The photo has gone viral, leaving many scratching their heads and others heading to the Stanley to see for themselves.

American Horror Stories: Ghosts and Hauntings

Many commenters on social media think it's a ghost (or two), and several amateur ghost hunters have weighed in suggesting it's unexplainable. Others, however, have a pretty good idea of what it is. Researcher Kenny Biddle of the Geeks & Ghosts podcast and the ""I am Kenny Biddle"" blog, examined the photo and noted that Yau used the panoramic feature on his iPhone to capture a full view of the grand stairwell.

This offers a clue because the in panorama mode the camera doesn't just take one photo but instead scans across the scene rapidly. Biddle notes that ""Panoramic images are not taken in the same fraction of a second as a normal images are. They take several seconds … which would allow Yau to start taking his panoramic image at one end of the room, and another guest or two to hit the halfway point down the stairs, turn the corner, and begin the second set of stairs to the floor as Yau ends his panoramic image on the other side of the room.""

Odd glitches using the panorama function on cameras are common, and many websites display hundreds of bizarre and double images. A Tumblr account titled ""Panorama Fail"" offers dozens of accidental digital grotesqueries. The ""ghost"" is ""most likely just a guest that was captured coming down the stairs while a panoramic image was taken over the course of several seconds,"" Biddle concludes.

British Viral 'Ghost Photo' Explained

Though some have dismissed the image as an artifact of the panorama feature, Biddle notes that ""when looking at a close up of the alleged ghost and second ghost (to the left of the more solid looking figure), we see that the features of both figures match up: the hair, the spaghetti-strap top, the height of the head, shoulders, and the top of the dress. This is a double image of the same person, not someone else. This effect was caused by the low light environment, slower scanning speed due to the camera trying to take in more light, and the movement of this person as they rounded the corner.""

Yau claims that he doesn't remember seeing anyone at the top of the staircase when he took the photo, but it's quite possible that he simply didn't notice the woman as she appeared and turned at the top of the stairs, as he was trying to hold the camera steady and take the photo. (Yau also claimed that he waited until there was no one in the area when taking the photo, though two people can be clearly seen on the left side of the photo.)

How the unexpected hotel guest was dressed likely also played a role in how her image was interpreted; she seems to be wearing a classic black or dark dress (as befits a fancy, well-known hotel); had she been wearing a yellow blazer and carrying a large Target shopping bag speculations about her spectral origins would likely have been scuttled.

Video: Do Ghosts Exist?

Creepy Context

Upon closer inspection there is nothing remarkable in the image; it's a perfectly ordinary blurry, double image common in long exposure and panoramic iPhone photographs. Had it been taken in any number of other locations, it would not likely have attracted such attention. So why is image played up as a mystery? The answer lies in its context.

Context plays two roles in the creation of ""spooky"" photos. Most people (that is, non-professional photographers) routinely take photos that are flawed in some way, or that have odd or unusual images in them, including flash reflected ""orbs,"" odd shadows, blurry body parts, double exposures, objects behind a person seemingly coming out of their heads, and so on. Usually they are ignored or deleted, unless the photographer (or someone else) decides that there's some reason why the photo might be of something supernatural.

The photo was taken at a doubly famous hotel—not only is it where the Stephen King-scripted, Stanley Kubrick-directed horror classic ""The Shining"" was filmed, but it's also claimed to be one of the most haunted hotels in the country. In fact the hotel specifically advertises itself as a paranormal destination and caters to ghost hunting tourists. Because of this, guests there are more likely to see ghosts (in person and in photos) than in comparable non-haunted lodgings—and this is true whether ghosts exist or not.

Ghost Stories: The Science Behind Sightings

This is because of a psychological process called priming, in which our expectations can influence our interpretations. To some degree we see what we want or expect to see—and that can include ghosts. People who are aware of a building's haunted reputation are more likely to take many photos, and anything odd or even potentially mysterious in those photos is likely to be considered evidence of ghosts.

A person could take an equal number of similar odd photos at a location not assumed to be haunted—a local supermarket or lake shore, for example—and the odd photographic artifact would not be as closely examined nor interpreted as anything mysterious, just a flawed photo.

The second contextual factor is of course that the Stanley hotel and others like it have a vested economic interest in promoting such photos as ghostly—or at the very least maintaining an agnostic stance about them. This isn't necessarily cynicism but pragmatism: There is no publicity to be gained by casting any doubt a claimed ghost photo taken in their hotel that's making news.

Biddle told Discovery News, ""This is a classic example of inexperienced investigators and fluff piece media jumping the gun and promoting an easily explainable anomaly as something supernatural rather than doing legitimate investigative/detective work to figure out the mystery. It's the reason paranormal investigation remains in the land of pseudoscience."" Whether ghosts haunt the Stanley remains to be seen, but it's unlikely that Yau's staircase double exposure is one of them.

"Scientist's aren't sure yet, but they do display REM-like patterns with high and low brain frequency during sleep. ",http://www.livescience.com/54593-do-australian-dragons-dream.html,"Australian dragons cycle through more than 350 episodes of rapid eye movement and slow-wave sleep each night, spending about half their sleeping hours in each phase.

Do dragons dream? Maybe, according to new research that finds rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep in a lizard, the Australian dragon, for the first time.

The discovery suggests that these phases of sleep may be more than 100 million years older than previously realized.

REM sleep is characterized by brain waves that look similar to waking brain activity. In mammals, the large muscles of the body are immobile, but the eyes twitch randomly during REM sleep. People do most of their dreaming in this phase of sleep. Slow-wave sleep is a non-REM sleep phase that is marked by slow brain waves called delta waves. [Top 10 Spooky Sleep Disorders]

Sleep's missing link?

Quiet, sleep-like periods are known in many animals, even invertebrates like fruit flies. However, researchers had only found REM and slow-wave sleep brain activity in mammals and birds. Both of those kinds of animals diverged from a common group, the amniotes — mammals, reptiles and birds that lay eggs on land or hold them in their bodies — more than 300 million years ago. The amniotes gave rise to the synapsids and the sauropsids. Mammals are the only group of synapsids left (the earliest arose about 195 million years ago). The sauropsids encompassed the dinosaurs as well as modern birds and reptiles.

The fact that sleep appeared only in these two disparate branches of the evolutionary tree was puzzling, said lead study researcher Gilles Laurent, a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Germany. It seemed that mammals and birds had independently evolved the brain patterns for REM and slow-wave sleep — a case of convergent evolution — or, more confusingly, that these sleep patterns were an ancestral trait that was lost multiple times among reptile lineages but somehow not in birds.

The new research, which will be published Friday (April 29) in the journal Science, suggests a much simpler explanation: REM and slow-wave sleep were present in a common amniote ancestor, and the fingerprints of these brain patterns had been missed until now.

""It poses many questions: How did sleep start? What did it start for? Is sleep the way that we understand it today in mammals, including humans, the same thing as what it started as?"" Laurent told Live Science. ""These questions are ones we'd like to find answers to.""

REM sleep in reptiles

Laurent and his colleagues didn't intend to study sleep, at first. His lab is interested in how the cortex works, and he uses lizards as model organisms to study this brain region. The researchers were using electrodes implanted in the brains of Australian dragons (Pogona vitticeps) to record brain activity.

An Australian dragon (Pogona vitticeps), the first lizard ever discovered to have mammalian-like brain patterns during sleep. The discovery, reported April 29 in the journal Science, suggests that the evolution of this brain activity may date back at least 320 million years. (Image credit: Dr. Stephan Junek, Max Planck Institute for Brain Research)

""In the middle of some experiments we were doing, we decided to let the recordings go overnight after a day's work, just to see what would happen during the night,"" Laurent said. ""And upon analyzing the results, there were interesting oscillations of activity that were very regular, that suggested the potential existence of sleep-related patterns of activity in the brain.""

Further recordings of the brains of five different lizards of the same species revealed two distinct sleep patterns. One showed high-frequency wave forms of about 20 cycles per second. The other showed low-frequency wave forms of less than 4 cycles per second. Video recordings of the sleeping lizards showed that during the high-frequency brain activity, the dragons' eyes twitched periodically.

""We had a characterization that was starting to become more and more like what we observe in mammalian sleep,"" Laurent said. ""A REM phase with broadband activity and high-frequency activity, and slow-wave sleep where there is no eye movement."" [What Do Dogs Dream About?]

The slow waves also showed negative spikes of electrical potential 200 to 400 milliseconds long, interrupted with an oscillation of the brain's electrical activity, Laurent said. These ""sharp waves"" and ""ripples"" are seen in the slow brain waves of mammalian sleep, he said.

Modern equipment and analysis techniques likely allowed Laurent and his team to find these brain patterns where others had failed, Laurent said.

There are differences between the sleep of lizards and mammals, however. In humans, for example, the REM phase of the sleep cycle is relatively short. A person might experience just 5 minutes per hour of slow-wave sleep at the beginning of the night, and then, as this phase gradually lengthens, 15 or 20 minutes per 90 minutes of slow-wave sleep later on. In the Australian dragon, the ratio of REM to slow-wave sleep is about 50-50. And the dragon cycles between the two every minute or minute and a half. They experience up to 350 sleep cycles per night, compared to four or five in humans.

These patterns arose in a brain region called the dorsal ventricular ridge, which doesn't exist in mammals, Laurent said. The sleep patterns seen in the study were similar to the ones seen in the mouse hippocampus during sleep, but strangely, the dorsal ventricular ridge is not analogous in its connections or neural cell makeup to the mammal hippocampus at all, Laurent said.

Do Australian dragons dream?

The research suggests that REM and slow-wave sleep may have evolved in the amniotes, but the patterns found in the lizards studied may be even older, Laurent said. Amphibian sleep has been studied and sleep patterns have not been found, he said, but perhaps scientists need to check again.

In humans, REM sleep is closely associated with dreaming. So do Australian dragons dream? There's no way to be sure right now, Laurent said. The answer may also depend on how you define dreaming. Under a strict definition in which dreaming requires higher cognition, the answer might be no. But if dreaming were defined as a replay of brain activity during sleep that resembles brain activity during wakefulness, lizards might well dream, Laurent said.

""Maybe in a few years, we'll be able to tell you,"" he said.

The silver birches' branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found.

""Our results show that the whole tree droops during night, which can be seen as position change in leaves and branches,"" study lead author Eetu Puttonen, a researcher at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, said in a statement. ""The changes are not too large, only up to 10 centimeters [4 inches] for trees with a height of about 5 meters [16 feet].""

It's unclear if the sun ""woke up"" the trees or if they relied on their own internal circadian rhythm, the researchers said. But ""the fact that some branches started returning to their daytime position already before sunrise would suggest this [internal circadian clock] hypothesis [is right],"" the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online on Feb. 29, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.

The finding isn't too surprising, but oddly enough it hadn't been studied until now, the researchers said. Most living organisms have day and night circadian rhythms, and any gardener will notice that some plants open their flowers in the morning and that some trees close their leaves at night, the researchers said.

The famed botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) found that flowers confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed, and naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) noted that the nocturnal movement of leaves and stalks on plants looked like sleep.

However, their studies concentrated on small plants grown in pots. The finding in trees represents the first study to use lasers to precisely measure the nighttime movements of wild trees, the researchers said.

The tree study didn't address why the branches and leaves drooped at night, but it's likely related to the turgidity, or the internal water pressure within the tree, the researchers said.

""Plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cells, which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis,"" said study co-author András Zlinszky, a researcher at the Centre for Ecological Research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. [How Tall Can Trees Grow?]

The researchers said in the future, they plan to examine the water movement within each tree and compare it to measurements made by the laser scans. ""This will give us a better understanding of the trees' daily tree water use and their influence on the local or regional climate,"" Puttonen said.

Only pathogen-free blood and no more than a few teaspoons otherwise it becomes toxic because of its high iron content that our bodies cannot process. ,http://www.livescience.com/15899-drinking-blood-safe.html,"With such a high interest in vampires these days — they're all over television, movies, and bookstore shelves — many people may be wondering if humans really can survive as vampires.

Turns out, sucking blood isn't just fiction fun: In 2011, a 19-year-old Texas man named Lyle Bensley allegedly broke into a woman's apartment and bit her on the neck. This was not bedroom playacting between lovers; Bensley claimed to be a centuries-old vampire who needed blood to stay alive. The woman escaped and called police, and Lyle the would-be vampire was arrested for assault.

But is it safe to drink blood?

Related: How much blood is in the human body?

In very small amounts (say, a few teaspoons), and if the blood is free from pathogens (such as the many blood-borne diseases), blood might not harm you. Beyond that, watch out.

The strange fact is, blood, when drank, is toxic. When confined to places where blood is supposed to be — such as the heart, vessels, and so on — it is essential for life. But when ingested it's a very different story. Of course all toxins have doses, and just as a tiny bit of poison won't necessarily harm you, the more you eat or drink, the greater the danger.

Related: 7 strange ways that people act like vampires

(Image credit: Isabell Schatz)

Because blood is so rich in iron — and because the body has difficulty excreting excess iron — any animal that consumes blood regularly runs a risk of iron overdose. While iron is necessary for all animals (and indeed most life), in high doses it can be toxic. This condition, called haemochromatosis, can cause a wide variety of diseases and problems, including liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders.

Even so, blood-feeding in humans seems to be more common than one might expect. John Edgar Browning of Georgia Tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a BBC article that thousands of people across the United States drink blood for various reasons. Some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by Browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn't overdo the blood meals: ""No vampire I’ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood,"" Browning said, according to BBC.

Unlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. According to Katherine Ramsland in her book ""The Science of Vampires"" (Penguin Putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, ""requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. When ingested, the blood goes through a tract that's adapted for extracting nutrients. Research on this system suggests that bats have a mucous membrane along the intestinal tract that acts as a barrier to prevent too much iron from getting into their bloodstreams.""

You, however, are not a vampire bat. Because humans did not evolve such an iron-extracting mechanism, drinking blood can kill us.

If you're thinking of sampling human blood, make sure there's a doctor handy — for you, not your victim.

Yes.,http://www.livescience.com/55086-deep-breathing-stress.html,"A new app from Apple coaches you through breathing exercises, but do these exercises really help reduce stress?

This week, Apple announced a number of new features for the Apple Watch, including an app due out this fall called Breathe, which will ""encourage users to take a moment in their day to do deep breathing exercises for relaxation and stress reduction,"" the company said in a statement.

The app will guide users though a timed breathing session, lasting 1 to 5 minutes. The watch can track a user's heart rate, and so at the end of a session, users will see a summary of their heart rate data, Apple said.

Although some experts recommend up to 20 minutes of breathing exercises a day, just 5 minutes of breathing exercises can help people feel calmer and refreshed, said Nancy Harazduk, director of the Mind-Body Medicine Program at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C.

Studies suggest that deep-breathing exercises may reduce certain types of stress and anxiety, and can temporarily lower blood pressure. But many of these studies have been small, so more research is needed to learn more about the exact benefits of deep-breathing exercises, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

Deep breathing is a type of relaxation technique that is intended to counteract the body's normal response to stress, the ""fight or flight"" response. Deep breathing lowers heart rate and reduces levels of stress hormones, according to the NCCIH.

And because deep breathing dilates blood vessels, it can also lower blood pressure, Harazduk said .

In addition, when you breathe deeply, you take in more oxygen, which may help improve your mental concentration and release endorphins that increase feelings of well-being, she told Live Science .

Focusing on breathing can also take your mind off stressful thoughts. ""One of the ways of letting go thoughts of anxiety or stress is by focusing on our breathing,"" Harazduk said. [11 Tips to Lower Stress]

Studies show that deep breathing and other relaxation techniques may reduce anxiety in people undergoing certain medical procedures, such as breast biopsies or dental treatment, the NCCIH said. A 2013 study from researchers in South Korea found that burn patients who practiced breathing exercises had lower scores on measures of pain and anxiety when doctors treated their burns, compared with people who didn't practice the breathing exercises.

Deep breathing might also help with some day-to-day stresses. A 2013 study from researchers at Tufts University found that people who had anxiety about taking math tests performed better on the tests, and reported feeling calmer, if they practiced a breathing exercise beforehand.

However, breathing exercises by themselves may not be the best treatment for people with generalized anxiety disorder, a mental health condition in which people find it hard to control their anxiety, according to the NCCIH. Studies suggest that people with generalized anxiety disorder who are treated with psychotherapy do better than those who practice relaxation techniques alone.

And although breathing exercises can lower blood pressure in the short term, it's not certain how long these effects last. The Food and Drug Administration approved a device called Resperate, which helps people slow their breathing, to reduce stress and lower blood pressure. A review study conducted by the British Hypertension Society, which included nearly 500 patients, found that the device did lower blood pressure, by about 3.7 millimeters of mercury for systolic and 2.5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure, on average.

But the longest-duration study in the review was nine weeks. The Society said that, because the effect was small and the studies were short, it could not recommend Resperate at this time.

Deep-breathing techniques should not be used as a replacement for conventional care, or to postpone seeing a doctor for a health problem, the NCCIH said.

The Breathe app will be available in the fall with the next update to the Apple Watch operating system, called watchOS 3.

(There are no results of someone actually drinking only water for a month, the article only discusses the benefits of water in general.) ",http://www.lifebuzz.com/drink-water/,"Water is crucial to basically everything in our bodies. When it comes to drinking water, there are two things that most of us know: One, water is good for us (Probably better than anything else). Two, most of us don't drink enough of it -- after all, it's pretty tough to get those eight eight-ounce glasses each and every day. But do you know the specific reasons why water is great for you, beyond your average run-of-the-mill hydration? From blood to heart health to bones and skin, water can be beneficial on virtually every level and we've compiled some information that will encourage you to make sure you stay hydrated. And, now that it's summer, you really can't argue with at least eight glasses of water a day: It will keep you healthy, cool, and totally energetic during the heat of these oppressive summer days. Find out why you shouldn't skimp on the H2O -- all summer long and beyond.After all, 90% of your body is water -- it needs to be replenished in order to function properly.

But there's actually a lot that people don't know about the benefits of drinking water. And it's more than just quenching your thirst.

For starters, water can help you lose weight. And it contributes to weight loss in more ways than one.

For starters, water helps satiate you. People who drink more water have less of a tendency to overeat, because they know when they are full. Nicola Locatelli

When it comes to weight loss, water also acts as a detoxifier. Think about it: Most other drinks have sugar, which lead to weight gain. All water does is help flush out those nasty toxins. USAID U.S

It can also increase your metabolism. Drinking as much water as possible boosts your metabolism by up to 24%. Drink ice cold water for best results. as it shocks your system into working just a bit harder. Helga Weber

Beyond weight loss, water has a number of other benefits as well. There's basically not a single part of the body that healthy water intake doesn't help. Aikawa Ke

For starters, it keeps your heart healthy by keeping your blood thin. Water prevents your blood from getting too thick, making heart attacks less of a threat, and to keep clots from forming.

It also helps keep your brain sharp. A recent study showed that drinking 8 to 10 cups of water a day can increase your brain power by up to 30%. Staying hydrated can help increase mental clarity and focus as well.

And it's not just milk that keeps your bones healthy. Water increases bone strength by adding a protective barrier around them, and strengthening cartilage. monkeywing

Frequent water consumption can help slow down the aging process. It really makes the skin healthy and young looking by stimulating collagen and cell reproduction. refeelwater / instagram

Water also decreases your risk of stroke. The same way that water can reduce your risk of heart attack, studies have shown that it can also prevent strokes.

Not to mention the positive effect it has on your joints. It also increases flexibility and keeps the connective tissue strong. In other words, drinking water will totally keep your yoga game strong. wallace_Lan

"No one is sure, but if they do it has no smell. ",http://www.dailydot.com/geek/do-birds-fart/?fb=ss&prtnr=mentalfloss,"Have you ever wondered, “Do birds fart?” No? Well maybe now we’ve sparked your curiosity.

They don’t fart—detectably. There’s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn’t seem like anyone has ever truly observed—or more importantly, measured—a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate?

As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don’t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird’s gastrointestinal tract, he’d be concerned something was wrong with the bird.

But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there’s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected.

In another blog post, she describes the only written account she’s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master’s thesis on blue jays.

One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas.

Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod’s observation.) He also acknowledges that the “wisp of whitish gas” could also have simply been water vapor—steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog’s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)

It’s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that “the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment” and break down into its smellier components—namely sulfur. So if birds don’t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn’t smell it.

Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.

But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air?

As far as we could tell, this isn’t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab’s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart “in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.” He also said that he’s never personally noticed a bird fart.

Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying “excuse me” after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird’s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. And without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.",Do birds fart?

"Triclosan, which scientists speculate may cause imbalances in gut bacteria. ",http://www.healthiestblog.com/2016/06/ingredient-consumer-products-damage-health.php,"Many consumer products contain this common antimicrobial agent which can have a negative impact on the human health.

Triclosan is a synthetic antimicrobial agent that can upset bacterial communities in the gut, a new study suggests.

Use of triclosan can also lead to ‘superbugs’ which are bacteria that are fully resistant to antimicrobials (e.g. antibiotics).

Triclosan was first introduced in the 1970s in hospital scrub soap and is now found in many consumer products, such as:

toys,

cosmetic products,

deodorants,

toothpastes,

mouth washes,

shampoos,

detergents,

bedding,

kitchen utensils,

cutting boards,

trash bags,

and surgical cleaning treatments.

Triclosan is absorbed through the skin easily and traces can be found in most people’s urine.

Dr Thomas Sharpton, an author of this study said:

“There has been a legacy of concern about exposure to microbial pathogens, which has led to increased use of these antimicrobial products. However, there’s now a growing awareness of the importance of the bacteria in our gut microbiome for human health, and the overuse of antibiotics that can lead to the rise of ‘superbugs’. There are consequences to constantly trying to kill the bacteria in the world around us, aspects we’re just beginning to understand.”

Exposure to triclosan makes changes to the microbial community structure and the diversity of microorganisms.

Also, some bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae are vulnerable and some — such as those in the Pseudomonas family — are resilient to the impact of triclosan.

Scientists believe that these changes can imbalance the bacteria in the gut, which in turn contributes to severe illnesses in humans.

Dr Christopher Gaulke, lead author of the study, said:

“Clearly there may be situations where antibacterial agents are needed. However, scientists now have evidence that intestinal bacteria may have metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune and neurological impacts, and concerns about overuse of these agents are valid. Cumulative impacts are also possible. We need to do significantly more evaluation of their effects, some of which might be dramatic and long lasting.”

The gut microbiome is vital for human health as it improves immune system function, produces micronutrients and stops the growth of pathogens in the body.

Abnormality in the gut microbiome can lead to conditions such as malnutrition, arthritis, diabetes and heart disease.

The study was published in PLOS ONE (Gaulkeet al., 2016).

"A diet high in fat. 
Thank you Andy!",http://www.healthiestblog.com/2016/06/diet-starves-brain.php,"Consumption of this diet starves the brain of much-needed glucose, a new study shows.

Consumption of high-fat-content foods causes reduction of glucose levels in the brain, a new study shows.

Three days of a high-fat diet in mice led to a depletion of blood glucose reaching the brain and unbalanced the body.

It took more than four weeks for the brain to restore the sugar uptake at a cost to the rest of the body.

Glucose is the primary fuel and the main source of energy for the brain.

When the brain does not get the fuel, this will affect cognitive skills and memory.

Scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Germany examined the mice’s brains to see how a high-fat diet affects them and how this can lead to diabetes and obesity.

Dr Alexander Jais, the study author, said:

“A high-fat diet reduces the uptake of blood glucose into the brain in as little as three days. So the brain is starving, even though the mice are consuming a lot of calories daily. Responsible for this is the protein GLUT-1, which is the most important glucose transporter at the blood-brain barrier.”

Free saturated fatty acids can have a toxic effect on the blood-brain barrier cells and reduce the GLUT-1 transporter.

The brain has no way to store glucose and some areas of the brain actually lack glucose and they need to get it immediately from the blood stream.

These areas include the cerebral cortex — which are responsible for learning and memory — and hypothalamus which controls the metabolism.

To compensate for the lack of energy, the brain takes action by using macrophages.

Macrophages are particular cells in the immune system and they can produce the growth factor VEGF.

This growth factor is part of the system that restores the oxygen supply to tissues and they can increase the production of GLUT-1.

The research team was able to measure the glucose levels in mice which were on high-fat diet.

They found that the glucose uptake in the brain will still reduce in mice that lack this growth factor.

Dr Jais said:

“As a result of this, the mice learn more slowly and have impaired memory.”

When the diet is high in fat the brain is looking for the sugar and to satiate its need will impact the rest of the body.

Dr Jais explained:

“We call it the selfish brain, because it gets its glucose by stimulating the body’s appetite for sweet foods and in the long run preventing the uptake in muscles and fat. The cells in the musculature are becoming resistant to insulin, the hormone that normally regulates glucose uptake in the cells of these organs. Ultimately, this leads to the development of diabetes.”

The study was published in Cell (Jais et al., 2016).

"Statistics show no positive academic effects, and studies show negative health effects. ",http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/homework-could-have-impact-kids-health-should-schools-ban-it/,"Reformers in the Progressive Era (from the 1890s to 1920s) depicted homework as a “sin” that deprived children of their playtime. Many critics voice similar concerns today.

Yet there are many parents who feel that from early on, children need to do homework if they are to succeed in an increasingly competitive academic culture. School administrators and policy makers have also weighed in, proposing various policies on homework.

So, does homework help or hinder kids?

For the last 10 years, my colleagues and I have been investigating international patterns in homework using databases like the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). If we step back from the heated debates about homework and look at how homework is used around the world, we find the highest homework loads are associated with countries that have lower incomes and higher social inequality.

Does Homework Result In Academic Success?

Let’s first look at the global trends on homework.

Undoubtedly, homework is a global phenomenon; students from all 59 countries that participated in the 2007 Trends in Math and Science Study (TIMSS) reported getting homework. Worldwide, only less than 7% of fourth graders said they did no homework.

TIMSS is one of the few data sets that allow us to compare many nations on how much homework is given (and done). And the data show extreme variation.

For example, in some nations, like Algeria, Kuwait and Morocco, more than one in five fourth graders reported high levels of homework. In Japan, less than 3% of students indicated they did more than four hours of homework on a normal school night.

TIMSS data can also help to dispel some common stereotypes. For instance, in East Asia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan – countries that had the top rankings on TIMSS average math achievement – reported rates of heavy homework that were below the international mean.

In the Netherlands, nearly one out of five fourth graders reported doing no homework on an average school night, even though Dutch fourth graders put their country in the top 10 in terms of average math scores in 2007.

Going by TIMSS data, the US is neither “A Nation at Rest” as some have claimed, nor a nation straining under excessive homework load. Fourth and eighth grade US students fall in the middle of the 59 countries in the TIMSS data set, although only 12% of US fourth graders reported high math homework loads compared to an international average of 21%.

So, is homework related to high academic success?

At a national level, the answer is clearly no. Worldwide, homework is not associated with high national levels of academic achievement.

But, the TIMSS can’t be used to determine if homework is actually helping or hurting academic performance overall, it can help us see how much homework students are doing, and what conditions are associated with higher national levels of homework.

We have typically found that the highest homework loads are associated with countries that have lower incomes and higher levels of social inequality – not hallmarks that most countries would want to emulate.

Impact Of Homework On Kids

TIMSS data also show us how even elementary school kids are being burdened with large amounts of homework.

Almost 10% of fourth graders worldwide (one in 10 children) reported spending multiple hours on homework each night. Globally, one in five fourth graders report 30 minutes or more of homework in math three to four times a week.

These reports of large homework loads should worry parents, teachers and policymakers alike.

Empirical studies have linked excessive homework to sleep disruption, indicating a negative relationship between the amount of homework, perceived stress and physical health.

What constitutes excessive amounts of homework varies by age, and may also be affected by cultural or family expectations. Young adolescents in middle school, or teenagers in high school, can study for longer duration than elementary school children.

But for elementary school students, even 30 minutes of homework a night, if combined with other sources of academic stress, can have a negative impact. Researchers in China have linked homework of two or more hours per night with sleep disruption.

Even though some cultures may normalize long periods of studying for elementary age children, there is no evidence to support that this level of homework has clear academic benefits. Also, when parents and children conflict over homework, and strong negative emotions are created, homework can actually have a negative association with academic achievement.

Should There Be “No Homework” Policies?

Administrators and policymakers have not been reluctant to wade into the debates on homework and to formulate policies. France’s president, Francois Hollande, even proposed that homework be banned because it may have inegaliatarian effects.

However, “zero-tolerance” homework policies for schools, or nations, are likely to create as many problems as they solve because of the wide variation of homework effects. Contrary to what Hollande said, research suggests that homework is not a likely source of social class differences in academic achievement.

Homework, in fact, is an important component of education for students in the middle and upper grades of schooling.

Policymakers and researchers should look more closely at the connection between poverty, inequality and higher levels of homework. Rather than seeing homework as a “solution,” policymakers should question what facets of their educational system might impel students, teachers and parents to increase homework loads.

At the classroom level, in setting homework, teachers need to communicate with their peers and with parents to assure that the homework assigned overall for a grade is not burdensome, and that it is indeed having a positive effect.

Perhaps, teachers can opt for a more individualized approach to homework. If teachers are careful in selecting their assignments – weighing the student’s age, family situation and need for skill development – then homework can be tailored in ways that improve the chance of maximum positive impact for any given student.

I strongly suspect that when teachers face conditions such as pressure to meet arbitrary achievement goals, lack of planning time or little autonomy over curriculum, homework becomes an easy option to make up what could not be covered in class.

Whatever the reason, the fact is a significant percentage of elementary school children around the world are struggling with large homework loads. That alone could have long-term negative consequences for their academic success.

"“Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up – there's a way out.” 
Thank you Gab for the link!",http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/stephen-hawking-gives-some-beautiful-advice-depression/,"World-renowned scientist Stephen Hawking is known for providing us with complex yet invaluable insights into space, time, and the nitty-gritty of theoretical physics. However, in a recent talk, the iconic physicist applied his brilliant mind to a more emotional matter.

Hawking gave a poignant message to people suffering from depression, making a poetic comparison between depression and a black hole – no matter how dark they seem, neither are impossible to escape.

Hawking said: “The message of this lecture is that black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought.

“Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up – there's a way out.”

He gave the speech in front of a crowd of over 400 people on Thursday evening, January 7, as part of the Reith lecture at the Royal Institute in London. The lecture was scheduled for November last year, but had to be postponed due to Hawking’s poor health.

Hawking, who turned 74 the day after the lecture, has lived with motor neuron disease for almost 53 years – despite being told he had just two years to live when diagnosed in 1963.

Speaking to the same audience, his daughter Lucy noted Hawking’s incredible mental fitness – both intellectually and emotionally.

“He has a very enviable wish to keep going and the ability to summon all his reserves, all his energy, all his mental focus and press them all into that goal of keeping going,” she said.

“But not just to keep going for the purposes of survival but to transcend this by producing extraordinary work – writing books, giving lectures, inspiring other people with neurodegenerative and other disabilities.”

For those lucky enough to have access to BBC Radio 4 , you’ll be able to listen to the full lecture through two broadcasts on January 26 and February 2 at 9 a.m.

A recent survey asked participants: ""if you were at a restaurant, which critter would make you drop your fork: Rodents, cockroaches, flies, ants, or snakes?"" 61% chose cockroaches. But scientists warn that flies are actually two-times more likely to spread germs - specifically those ubiquitous, hard-to-swat houseflies.

So what's the science behind this? Well, flies eat some of the grossest things imaginable: Poop, garbage, rotting animal carcasses. Another fact about flies is that they can't chew, so in order to eat, they spit-up enzymes onto their food, which dissolves it and lets them slurp it up.

RELATED: Flies Use Fighter Pilot Maneuver to Avoid Swatting

Even though it's probably the grossest thing imaginable, it's actually the bacteria and viruses that get stuck to their body that spreads disease and makes people sick, not their enzymatic spit-up. They only need to touch your food for a second for their legs or the tiny hairs all over their bodies to transfer germs from all those nasty things they eat onto what you're eating. And since flies can transfer serious, contagious diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid, it's probably best if you avoiding eating things that a fly lands on.

Are you the type of person who throws out your food if a fly lands on it? Have you become one after watching this video? Let us know in the comments section below because we'd love to hear from you.

"Some researchers claim that because humans are so powerful, yet so sensitive to Earth procceses (like weather), humans were brought by aliens 60k-200k years ago. ",http://www.lifecoachcode.com/2016/04/18/humans-did-not-evolve-on-earth/,"This year, other scientists have argued that life originated on Mars, due to a mineral found in Martian meteorites, thought to be crucial to the genesis of life.

BUT, a new book by American ecologist Dr. Ellis Silver offers arguments, based on human physiology, that humans as species may not have evolved alongside other life on Earth – but arrived from elsewhere, brought here by aliens as recently as a few tens of thousands of years ago.

This is a BIG claim, however, the facts that Silver puts on the table will make you say “how did I not realized this sooner!!”

Silver, an environmentalist who is currently working with the effort to clean plastic debris from the Pacific, says his book aims to provoke debate – and is based on scientific work on the difference between humans and other animals.

“The Earth approximately meets our needs as a species, but perhaps not as strongly as whoever brought us here initially thought,” Silver said in an interview with Yahoo news.

“Mankind is supposedly the most highly developed species on the planet, yet is surprisingly unsuited and ill-equipped for Earth’s environment: harmed by sunlight, a strong dislike for naturally occurring foods, ridiculously high rates of chronic disease, and more,”

Dr. Ellis says that humans might suffer from bad backs because they evolved on a world with lower gravity.

He also says that it is strange that babies’ heads are so large and make it difficult for women to give birth, which can result in fatalities of the mother and infant.

“No other truly native species on this planet has this problem,” he says. Silver also points out to the “extra” 223 genes in human beings, which are not found in any other species, and to the lack of a fossil “missing link”.

“Lizards can sunbathe for as long as they like – and many of them do. We can just about get away with it for a week or two. But day after day in the sun? Forget it. You might as well just lie down on the freeway and wait for a bus to hit you.” We are dazzled by the sun, which is also odd, says Silver – most animals are not.

“We are all chronically ill,” says Silver.

“Indeed, if you can find a single person who is 100% fit and healthy and not suffering from some (perhaps hidden or unstated) condition or disorder (there’s an extensive list in the book) I would be extremely surprised – I have not been able to find anyone.” Silver continues.

It’s like we desperately try to hide the fact that we do not fully belong in this Nature we try to fit in.

We say that we evolved but, if we truly evolved here, shouldn’t we be more in connection with Nature instead of being less and less, to a point that we even harm life around us?

Something just does not seem right.

“I believe that many of our problems stem from the simple fact that our internal body clocks have evolved to expect a 25 hour day (this has been proven by sleep researchers), but the Earth’s day is only 24 hours. This is not a modern condition – the same factors can be traced all the way back through mankind’s history on Earth.”

There is another key element we usually tend to ignore.

Many people say that they don’t feel like they belong on Earth, nor feel at home here, says Dr. Ellis Silver.

And this fact is not something to see as irrelevant, especially not if the majority of the human population feels like this.

“This suggests (to me at least) that mankind may have evolved on a different planet, and we may have been brought here as a highly developed species.” says Silver

What if we migrated here from Mars? And this, believe it or not, is not as farfetched as it seems. Scientists recently discovered that Mars had a strong Magnetic field before it became a wasteland.

Mars is the only planet in our Solar System that has a day of 25 hours, it is further away from The Sun than Earth, it has weaker gravity and it was discovered that Mars had large amounts of water in the past.

What if there was some kind of destruction of global proportions and we had to migrate to save our species?

This would also prove the stories of Humanity being more evolved in the past, but because of an unknown incident we “fell” from “heaven” on earth, and went through a phase of forgetting.

“My thesis proposes that mankind did not evolve from that particular strain of life, but evolved elsewhere and was transported to Earth (as fully evolved Homo sapiens) between 60,000 and 200,000 years ago,” says Dr. Ellis Silver.

Some people are genetically better at sports. ,https://www.vox.com/2016/5/30/11767704/practice-doesnt-make-perfect,"I was a horrible lacrosse player in high school: bad at catching the ball, slow, and not very aggressive.

Yet I'd spend hours at a handball wall with my stick: throwing, catching, repeating. I played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games. Freshman and sophomore years, I made it onto the junior varsity team — a miracle.

By 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse. This is when my history teacher — the varsity coach — pulled me aside and suggested I shouldn't bother. I'd probably be cut, he said (adding that I was getting very good grades).

For me, practice did not make perfect. Lo and behold, I now have scientific validation.

A meta-analysis in Perspectives in Psychological Science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn't matter that much.

More precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other.

Even more simply: Some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone. There was a reason I lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field. They probably had a natural advantage on me.

""One important thing — that's easy to misunderstand— is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual,"" Brooke Macnamara, the lead author of the Perspectives paper, tells me. ""So if a person practices, they will get better. Almost across the board, practice should improve one’s performance.""

But it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. ""Essentially, learning rates vary,"" Macnamara says. ""Some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice.""

The analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played. Practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities.

Practice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play. Which suggests ""deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill,"" the study reports. The analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didn't change this figure much either.

So what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent?

Here's where we should note a limitation of studying practice: Researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty.

But Macnamara doesn't think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100.

""There’s probably not one huge contributor that’s accounting for everything else,"" she says.

Instead, there's likely a whole constellation of factors — some of which are genetic or biological in nature — that explain why some people are better athletes than others. They include:

Personality and perseverance

Propensity to get injured

Propensity to choke under pressure

Individual differences in maximum oxygen uptake

Differences in how we acquire muscle mass

Coordination

Height

Enjoyment of competition

""We have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] — different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes,"" she says. ""All of those things are important and interact with each other. Which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance.""

Overall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular ""10,000 hour rule,"" which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it. The research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesn't back that hypothesis up.

On the other hand, it's not like these findings are an excuse not to try.

""Eighteen percent is big,"" Macnamara says. ""We're trying to argue against these ideas that it's so important it accounts for nearly everything."" Practice matters, but it's unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid.

For the athletically un-inclined, like myself, it's a bit of a relief. It's okay if you can't make up the difference with practice, or if you're just a ""slow learner"" when it comes to sports. It's also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing you'll unlikely be the best.

Growing up, my dad was on a quest to find ""my sport"" — the activity I'd finally master. Lacrosse was the closest we came. But it was mostly a parade of failures. Baseball: Throw a ball at me and I'll be more likely to bruise than catch it. Soccer: I was much too slow. Basketball: All of the above. Tennis: I was cut from the middle school team.

I'm not a well-coordinated person, and that's just fine.

These days I stick to activities that don't involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing. I love physical activity. Life's just too short to spend it on activities you're horrible at.",I was really bad at sports in high school. This study helps me understand why.
"As smoking rates have decreased, obesity rates have increased. ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/24/one-of-americas-healthiest-trends-has-had-a-pretty-unexpected-side-effect/,"The precipitous fall has offered a glimpse into what happens when a country quits smoking cigarettes. And the answer is a ton of good things. The dip has coincided with steep declines in the rate of lung cancer, the death rate associated with cardiovascular disease (it peaked in 1968) and a number of other negative health outcomes.

But it has also, interestingly, coincided with another trend that isn't quite as encouraging: the rise of obesity. And it's not unreasonable to think that the two might be at least somewhat related.

""No one would recommend cigarette smoking as a way to combat obesity,"" said Charles Baum, a professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University, and the author of a study published in the journal Review of Economics of the Household. ""But realistically, the decline in smoking might very well have had some effect on the rise of obesity.""

Baum, along with Shin-Yi Chou, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), wondered what, if any, changes in human behavior have played a role in the growing pervasiveness of obesity, which has doubled over the past quarter-century. So they tried to estimate how things beyond the obvious and more immediate shifts in things like diet and exercise might have contributed.

In order to approximate the effect of various socio-environmental factors — things such as changes in food prices, physical demands at work, urban sprawl, racial composition, age distribution and cigarette consumption — Baum and Chou used almost 30 years’ worth of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The survey gathered detailed information about the social and economic backgrounds, weight, height and many other characteristics of more than 12,000 youth. The researchers controlled for several variables, including age, education, income and work experience. And what they found is that nothing seemed to have had much of an effect at all. That is, aside from the changes in cigarette consumption.

""The decline in the prevalence of cigarette smoking didn't have a large effect, comparatively speaking, but it had an effect,"" said Baum. ""It can explain about as much as 4 percent of the increase in obesity, according to our estimates.""

The impact associated with the fall in cigarette consumption was the largest of all the factors the researchers tested — such as the rise of urbanization, the fall in national food stamp enrollment and the growth in the number of restaurants — and that held true in all three of the models they built to compare the various factors.

The cigarette diet

The connection between the national shift away from smoking and growth in the collective American gut isn't as far-fetched as it might seem.

Cigarettes are a well-known appetite suppressant, not just within popular culture, but also among scientists who have studied tobacco's effect on the body. There is a plethora of research that suggests nicotine tends to decrease food intake (including this recent peer-reviewed study, which was published in the journal Science). The reasons, outlined in a slightly older, 1991 study, include resultant changes to the nervous system, physical activity and preferences in food consumption.

And it hasn't just been shown that smoking cigarettes can lead to weight loss — it's fairly well-established that people tend to gain weight after quitting, too.

Story continues below advertisement

""We know smoking cessation leads to weight gain. That's pretty accepted,"" said Yoni Freedhoff, an obesity expert at the University of Ottawa. ""Of course, the amount of weight gain varies, but it can be as high as 12 to 20 pounds.""

The effect is so significant that a study conducted in the early 1990s, which found that ""major weight gain is strongly related to smoking cessation,"" noted that it's likely part of what makes it so hard for people to quit.

So what?

Despite the collective eagerness to pin the obesity epidemic, which now affects more than a third of all U.S. adults, on any one particular thing, the truth is that it's more likely the result of a complex web of many and varied societal shifts. There are things, of course, that contribute more than others — the rise of processed food, for instance, or the uptick in the number of calories Americans consume. But there are also smaller, overlooked factors that slip through the cracks, evading the broader discussion.

The fall of tobacco seems like it might very well be one of those things, as evidenced not only by Baum's study, but also by myriad studies undertaken over the years, which have built on our understanding of the relationship between smoking and weight.

""Obviously, it's hard to establish any causal relationship here, but I would definitely say it's plausible that the fall in smoking contributed to the rise in obesity,"" said Freedhoff, the obesity expert.

What exactly are we supposed to glean from the suggestion that the fall in smoking might have contributed to the rise in obesity? The answer is not that anyone should look back upon the days when more than half of the population smoked regularly with nostalgia. Rather, according to Baum, it's better to view the study's finding as more of a point of interest, a takeaway that allows us to look at how societal changes move like waves that ripple, touching other shifts, even if only slightly.

The fall in smoking ""is an overwhelmingly positive thing,"" he said. ""It's just useful to know what some of the side effects of quitting are. It's interesting to see how they might be contributing to national trends, like the rise in obesity.""",One of America’s healthiest trends has had a pretty unexpected side effect
The best age to marry is exactly at 32 to reduce the odds of divorce. ,https://www.fatherly.com/parenting-and-relationships/science-identifies-the-best-age-to-marry-still-debating-when-to-have-kids/,"Data geeks have been responsible for some of our most important discoveries over the past few years, including high-value baseball players, the nation’s best burrito, and now this: The ideal age to get married.

According to new research from The Institute Of Family Studies, it’s 32.

The report swings (and mostly misses) as a bunch of explanations, but states definitively that “prior to age 32 or so, each additional year of age at marriage reduces the odds of divorce by 11 percent. However, after that the odds of divorce increase by 5 percent a year.”

That’s cool if you’re thinking about popping the question, but how does it align with previous research on the best age to have kids?

According to multiple studies summarized in Twentysomething: Why Do Young Adults Seem Stuck? by Robin Marantz Henig and Samantha Henig, it depends on what you mean by “best.” Biologically, prime baby time for women is only ideal if they’re looking for a role on MTV’s Teen Mom. Kids born to 26-year-old moms are statistically least likely to have birth defects, but kids born to 32-year-olds have the lowest overall infant mortality.

To save your calculator thumb, know that the average nets out at 31. But also know that the best age for a woman to give birth, in terms of her overall life expectancy, is 34.

That’s a lot of squishy data to divine a “best” age from, but how about this: Get married around 30 and then have your first kid before 32.

"3 years of cold and rain leading to more marshland that the horses could not traverse, and spoilage of crops leading to less food supplies for the horde which was later exacerbated further by famine. 
Thank you Darko for sending this in!",http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-finally-know-what-stopped-mongol-hordes-from-conquering-europe,"In 1206, Genghis Khan, a fierce tribal chieftain from northern Mongolia, began to take over the world. The khan’s ruthless tactics and loyal horde swept across Asia.

One territory after another fell under the overwhelming force of the Mongol Empire, which would eventually stretch from the eastern shores of China. A series of successful forays in Hungary and Poland made even Europe seem within reach of conquering.

But this unstoppable wave of victories in Europe suddenly ended. Almost as soon as the Mongols set their sights set on Austria, they abruptly returned to Asia.

Historians could only guess why until now, since written accounts from the point of view of Mongol military leaders are sparse. But a new study in the journal Scientific Reports looked at a different kind of record to solve the mystery of the horde’s abrupt exit from central Europe: tree rings.

This wooden chronicle revealed that a cold and wet period set in for years, leading ""to reduced pastureland and decreased mobility, as well as hampering the military effectiveness of the Mongol cavalry"", according to a press release.

Here’s how the Mongols rose to power - and how natural climate change may have forced them to cut their losses and stop a fearsome war of attrition.

Before Hungary

When Genghis Khan died in 1227, he left his son, Ogodei, a territory that extended from northeast China to the Caspian Sea, just north of modern-day Iran. In total, it measured an astounding 11 million square miles (28 million square km).

""Whether measured by the total number of people defeated, the sum of the countries annexed, or by the total area occupied, Genghis Khan conquered more than twice as much as any man in history,"" writes historian Jack Weatherford in his book, Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World.

After Genghis’ death, Ogodei Khan carried forward his father’s legacy. The khanate expanded to the east and west, conquering the remainder of northwest China and pushing into Russia, aided by a wet period that allowed the Mongol armies to bring thousands of horses across the largest desert in Asia: the Gobi.

By 1240, Kiev had been sacked and the horde was rapidly advancing west. Their cavalry and siege tactics were laying waste to the cities of Europe, and, perhaps more importantly, they brought along Chinese gunpowder.

This series of unqualified successes brought the vast Mongol army to Hungary in March 1241. King Bela IV fled his palace in Pest (now Budapest), and Ogodei’s armies slaughtered an estimated 1 million Hungarians: Troops, clerics, nobles, knights, and peasants. It was one of the bloodiest defeats of the medieval period.

In December of 1241, Ogodei Khan died unexpectedly. Some historians have argued that Batu, Ogodei’s nephew who had been leading the western campaign, turned back toward the Mongol capital of Karakorum for the election of a new leader.

But Batu never returned returned to Mongolia, instead remaining in southern Russia to rule the Golden Horde. Meanwhile, Ogodei’s wife, Toregene, took power as the Great Khatun.

An abrupt end

The following year, everything changed. The horde suddenly turned south, moving through modern-day Serbia, and then headed back through Russia. Though subsequent khans staged occasional raids on European cities, the major war campaign was over.

Several hypotheses exist as to why the army abandoned their western front, but, the authors of the new paper argue, none are fully sufficient to explain the change in course.

The authors sampled wood from five regions of Eurasia to track what the weather was like during the period of the Mongols’ most extensive reach.

Trees are especially sensitive to small changes in climactic conditions: in wet years, they add thick layers of bark to their trunks. In dry years, the rings are thinner, reflecting the lack of water to a tree.

They found the climate in Hungary and its surroundings were unusually cold and wet for about three years, from 1238 to 1241. The extra moisture and early spring thaw turned the Hungarian plains into marshes and swampland - unsuitable terrain for moving the thousands of horses the Mongol armies relied on for transportation and warfare.

The last year of the eastern European campaign, 1242, they note, was especially damp. This led to crop spoilage, further reducing the food supply for the khan’s hordes. Famine later set in and killed thousands in the region.

It’s likely that Ogodei’s commanders chose a southern route because of its relatively drier conditions, the authors write, directing them away from Europe.

What happened to the Mongols afterward? Ogodei Khan’s death kicked off a spate of power struggles among Genghis’ sons and grandsons, fracturing the Mongol Empire into pieces that never reunified.

His lineage, however, continued to found dynasties in India, China, Persia, and Siberia. The Mongol people continue to live in China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and modern-day Mongolia, where Genghis Khan’s portrait appears on currency, vodka, and cigarettes, and his name even graces Ulaanbaatar’s international airport.

As scientists gain the ability to examine the climate record in greater detail, we’re discovering more about how climate shaped history. Unusual climates probably allowed Polynesians to spread out across the South Pacific, led to the fall of an ancient metropolis in pre-colonial Mexico, and encouraged Attila the Hun’s campaign of terror against the Roman Empire 800 years before Genghis Khan.

The authors conclude that their study of the Mongolian withdrawal from Hungary, ""illustrates the incidence of even small climate fluctuations upon a historical event"".

It also hints at a lesson for our climate future: a few degrees is all it takes to change the course of human history.

"Two high school students were permitted to perform experiments in microgravity (weightlessness). One tested growth of bacteria used for anti-fungal purposes (the growth was not affected) and the other, the ability of jumping spiders to adapt and catch their prey (they did so successfully without gravity, then adapted again back on earth).

YouTube is a great place to find blooper, snuggly kitten or music videos. Now, it’s also a place to post grand ideas for microgravity research studies. Two of those ideas actually got to fly to the International Space Station. The YouTube Space Lab competition provided just such an opportunity, and three students saw their research performed aboard the orbiting laboratory.

For then-high school students Dorothy Chen and Sara Ma of Troy, Mich. and Amr Mohamed of Alexandria, Egypt, the sky no longer is the limit for their research questions. Chen, Ma and Mohamed completed research investigations as winners of the YouTube Space Lab global contest. The competition invited 14- to 18-year-old students to submit two-minute videos via YouTube to propose physics or biology investigations for astronauts to perform aboard the space station. Their research was chosen out of more than 2,000 entries received from around the world.

The two winning studies looked at the anti-fungal properties of the bacteria Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) in microgravity, and the predatory behavior of Salticus scenicus and Phiddipus johnsoni, also known as a zebra jumping spider and a red-backed jumping spider, respectively. The results they received from their research informed them that microgravity can be a wily participant in a research study held aboard an orbiting laboratory in space.

In a live video stream with the space station, Chen, Ma, Mohamed and NASA astronaut Sunita Williams were interviewed by Bill Nye the Science Guy about the two investigations. “To see it working is just mind-blowing,” said Chen, after talking with Williams on the station about her project. “It’s weird,” remarked Ma, “it’s like we saw the prototype for our bacteria container, and now [Williams] is holding it. It’s just really surreal.”

Chen and Ma hypothesized that B. subtilis, a naturally occurring bacteria commonly used as an anti-fungal agent for agricultural crops, would have increased anti-fungal properties when grown in microgravity compared to the same bacteria produced on Earth. Their testing also added phosphates and nitrates to the B. subtilis nutrient source to see if the additives affected growth and anti-fungal strength. The phosphates and nitrates acted as nutrients to potentially boost growth of the bacteria. The outcome of their investigation aboard the space station showed that the least amount of growth in the bacteria occurred in microgravity as compared to bacteria produced on Earth. They found that microgravity had no effect on the degree to which phosphates and nitrates affect B. subtilis growth.

In reaction to the results of her study with Ma, Chen said, “It was a little difficult to make hypotheses about the reason for the results since we never directly interacted with our experiment, but we think it may have to do with the specific strain of B. subtilis that we used.” For additional study, “I would want to include a control strain,” added Chen.

When asked how the experience of having her research conducted aboard the space station impacted her career goals, Chen said, “It has made me much more curious about the possibilities of research aboard the space station or in microgravity in general.”

Mohamed, now a college student in California, was excited about seeing his zebra jumping spider research in action while talking with Williams in orbit. “The best scientists and astronauts are the ones who work on the station, and it’s an honor to have my own experiment be done there.”

Mohamed's research hypothesized that jumping spiders, like the zebra and red-backed species, would not be able to adapt their hunting abilities to microgravity. Jumping spiders do not build webs for catching their food, instead using their vision to hunt prey, jumping and striking with a fatal bite. This hypothesis was proven wrong while the investigation was conducted aboard the space station, as the spiders did adapt to microgravity to catch prey. “The results did indeed contradict my hypothesis, which was very exciting,” exclaimed Mohamed. “I think it is boring when experiments turn out as expected or when the universe behaves as observed.”

“This competition was by far the best experience of my life. It is something that will stay with me forever,” says Mohamed, when asked how the experience of having his research conducted aboard the space station impacted his career goals. “I am currently studying engineering at my [college] in California. I am involved with the Student Space Flight Initiative. I really want space exploration to be a part of my future.”

In appreciation of the YouTube Space Lab Project, NASA, the American Astronautical Society and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space recognized Zahaan Bharmal of Google for the project as a Top Education Application on the International Space Station in 2012. Bharmal acknowledged the importance of YouTube Space Lab and other space education programs as a key motivator for students to pursue careers in research and engineering and, in turn, further human space exploration. “The first man or woman to one day walk on Mars is, today, a child,"" said Bharmal. ""YouTube Space Lab—and programs like it—are so very important to those on Earth because they are helping to inspire this next generation of explorers who may one day find a new home beyond Earth.”

By Juan Cole | (Informed Comment) | —

The adoption of wind and solar for electricity generation around the world is happening at a growing pace, and the likelihood is that it will displace hydrocarbons in fifteen to twenty years (decades sooner than Big Coal, Big Oil and Big Gas expect). Here are some stories illustrating that stepped-up pace.

Germany’s wind power output is up by a third in the first five months of 2015 over the same period the previous year. In part, some offshore projects that had been delayed have started coming on line, adding 3 gigawatts of capacity. In part, Germany’s government plans to reduce incentives for wind and has already done so for solar, on the theory that these are now mature industries. The planned changes caused owners of planned wind turbine plants to rush to finish them so as to benefit from the more generous current policies. In 2015, it is expected that for the first time, Germany will generate more electricity via renewables like wind and solar than by its aging set of 8 nuclear reactors. The cost of electricity in Germany is historically low this year as a result of the wind and solar installations in the country, and is half what it is in Britain.

China added 5 gigawatts of new solar capacity in the first three months of 2015! That is nearly equivalent to all the solar installations ever built in Spain. China is going for 17 gigawatts of new solar capacity in 2015. That will make it about tied with Germany, currently the leading solar power in the world, with 33 gigawatts of installed coapacity.

The state of Maharashtra in India has announced a plan to nearly double its power generation from renewables over the next five years, with plans to have 7.5 gigawatts of solar energy and 5 gigawatts of wind by 2020. At the moment, 9% of the state’s energy comes from renewables,and this plan would bring the total to 15%. The plan is revenue-neutral, in part because of expected help from the Indian federal government. Maharashtra lies on the country’s west coast and includes the mega-city of Mumbai (Bombay), its capital. The state has a population of 114 million, making it more populous than the Philippines and nearly as populous as Mexico. That is, if it were an independent country, it would be no. 12 by population. The state’s annual gross domestic product is $233 billion, putting it in the same neighborhood as Iraq, Chile and the Philippines.

Wind power in Brazil doubled in the past year, and solar is up 62%. Brazil is looking to add 6 new gigawatts of electricity generation capacity in 2015.

The United Arab Emirates plans to add 100 megawatts of new solar PV capacity soon. By 2017 the largest solar plant in the Middle East will open, with a capacity of 200 megawatts. By 2021, the UAE plans to get 24% of its electricity from renewables. The UAE is a country of about 9 million, though only about 2 million of those are citizens. It has a GDP of about $400 billion annually, mainly income earned from petroleum exports. But Dubai has emerged as a finance hub and the country is diversifying away from oil. Unlike American CEO’s, the Gulf sheikhs are usually not in any doubt about climate change or the likelihood that the globe will have to give up burning hydrocarbons. The UAE is attempting to position itself as a major player in green energy markets via its Masdar corporation.

Why is all this happening? Because solar power and wind power are competitive with hydrocarbons even if we don’t figure in externalities. Their real price is rapidly falling. Externalities are things like pollution, which economists often do not figure into their formulas for profitability. If we considered externalities, then coal, gas and oil are worthless because they are so destructive. Burning them is like setting off multiple atomic bombs in the atmosphere. But even if you left a little thing like that out of your equations, solar and wind can now compete with other forms of energy in the global marketplace.

For instance, Dubai let a bid for a new solar PV plant that will generate electricity for only 6 cents a kilowatt hour. It would have cost the UAE more than that to build a natural gas plant. We are only at the beginning of a huge electricity price drop.

The Sun will collapse when it runs out of fuel (hydrogen) to counteract the immense gravity holding it together. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/physicist-brian-greene-just-explained-to-colbert-how-the-world-will-end,"When we get all caught up thinking about the zombie apocalypse, the robot revolution, or something a little more realistic, like say, an antibiotic-resistant superbug that could seriously wipe millions of us out, we're talking small-time 'end of the world' stuff. Robots might rise up against us and destroy humanity forever, but the world will keep on spinning, and the Solar System will still have eight planets (sorry Pluto).

But nothing is forever, no matter how many billions of years you've existed, and theoretical physicist Brian Greene just demonstrated to Colbert how a star like our Sun will end.

Now, we don't want to alarm you or anything, but at some point, our Sun is going to run out of fuel, collapse in on itself, and everything we know and love will die.

If you have kids, that's something you maybe want to give the delicate 'birds and the bees' treatment to when it comes time to explain that little nugget of truth to them, lest they end up like one of Louis CK's daughters, when he decided to marvel at the incredible, flaming violence of it all:

""She started crying immediately, crying bitter tears for the death of all humanity... and now she knows all of those things: she’s gonna die, everybody she knows is gonna die, they’re gonna be dead for a very long time, and then the Sun’s gonna explode. She learned that all in 12 seconds, at the age of seven.""

The sad futility of existence aside, the science behind how and why a star millions of times more massive than our Sun implodes in on itself is fascinating, and nobody explains it as clearly as Greene in the video above.

And he takes things one step further, by bringing a record-breaking Galilean canon into the studio to demonstrate just how far the shockwaves of destruction will emanate from a dying sun. Dude makes breaking a world record look suspiciously easy.

Watch the video above to find out more about our ultimate demise, and check out this video by Physics Girl if you can't get enough of those stacked balls:

Take a look at a bunch of women's OkCupid profiles and you'll be hard pressed to find one that says, ""I'm looking for a guy who makes me laugh, loves trying new foods, and — oh! knows how to spin a mean yarn.""

And yet new research suggests that storytelling prowess is a desirable quality in a guy — possibly because it signals that they're high-status. Men, on the other hand, don't seem to be fazed by women's ability to tell a good tale.

Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and SUNY Buffalo came to these conclusions after conducting a series of studies with hundreds of male and female undergrads as participants.

In one study, undergrads read descriptions of men and women, some of which specified that the man or woman tells great stories. Results showed that women found men who were good storytellers more attractive as long-term partners than men who were only decent storytellers, or men whose bios didn't mention storytelling ability at all.

Men, on the other hand, didn't rate women more attractive when those women were described as good storytellers.

The researchers also asked the participants to indicate whether they thought the man or woman would be popular, admired, and a good leader. Answers to these questions indicated how high-status the person seemed.

Sure enough, men who were supposedly good storytellers were perceived by women as higher status. Again, though, women who were supposedly good storytellers were not perceived by men as more attractive or of higher status.

At this point, it's hard to say for sure why women are drawn to men who can tell a good story. The authors suggest that ""storytelling ability reflects a man's ability to gain resources. Good storytellers may be more likely to influence others or to gain positions of authority in society.""

Story continues

Previous research has found that women prefer high-status guys, so this isn't especially surprising — what's new is the idea that storytelling ability is an indicator of status.

Of course, future research is necessary to see if watching and listening to a man tell a story is as appealing as reading a story he's written.

Yet this study adds to a growing body of research on the nonphysical characteristics that can make men attractive to women, like mindfulness and altruism. In some cases, these attributes seem to be even more important than a man's looks.

Bottom line: Women might not explicitly reveal that they're looking for a guy who can tell a good story — in fact, they might not even realize that's what they want. But if you want to impress a woman, consider ditching the pickup lines and starting with ""Once upon a time ..."" instead.

What if she takes a year or two off—is the gap on her resume counted as experience, or a strike against her? If she applies for a research grant, will she get it?

Today, February 11, is the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. This is the first such commemorative day dedicated to asking these questions and coming up with solutions to a problem that affects communities from the wealthiest, most urbane settings to the poorest corners of the globe.

In place after place, women and girls are lagging behind their male counterparts in the sciences. A quick look at the stats shows why the international community so urgently needs to do a better job of promoting women in science.

A Global Problem

Worldwide, women account for just 28 percent of all researchers. Even though enrollment numbers are up and more women are studying science, they’re not matching their male counterparts with PhDs and jobs with critical decision-making clout. And we cannot assume the status quo will gradually change over time as more of those women graduate with degrees in science, technology and engineering. “Gaps and barriers persist throughout the scientific research system,” notes a flagship UNESCO science report on this issue titled, Towards 2030.



Even in Europe and the United States, the numbers of women in positions of “leadership and prestige” remain stagnant despite a decade-long push for change. “Each step up the ladder of the scientific research system sees a drop in female participation until, at the highest echelons of scientific research and decision-making, there are very few women left,” the report says. Reasons cited include a host of cultural phenomena: the maternal wall or glass ceiling, lack of recognition and support for women in leadership, and bias—both conscious and subconscious.

The latter is particularly pernicious and difficult to change. “Science remains one of the few sectors where gender bias is common and considered acceptable by some,” according to UNESCO. There is a persistent underlying belief that women simply cannot do science as well as men—or that they are overly emotional and distracting to men.

When women are missing from classrooms and research labs, they are less likely to be invited to research councils, think tanks, and the editorial boards of scholarly journals. They will not move up to political forums and roundtables of global policymaking.

The UN decided to set aside one day—Feb. 11—each year to promote women in science because it is critical to the future of humanity, and this planet. This is not just about do-good, feel-good morality goals; it’s about health and prosperity, life and death. In countries where women and girls are denied education, child and maternal death rates are higher. But when women are educated and included in decision-making circles—in the family, the village, the country—economies grow and mortality rates decline.

Take, for example, climate change. As a whole, women suffer the effects of climate change more than men. “Since men tend to enjoy a higher socio-economic status, women are disproportionately affected by droughts, floods and other extreme weather events and marginalized when it comes to making decisions on recovery and adaptation,” according to UNESCO. Yet not nearly as many women as men work in scientific fields involving climate change adaptation strategies. Not nearly as many women as men have decision-making powers—at home or in the community—to determine the best strategies for family and cultural survival. Participants at last December’s COP21 talks in Paris noted a striking gender imbalance, “detrimental to taking action to save people from the ravages of climate change.”

Think, for a moment, about daily life in a traditionally patriarchal society. Let’s say you’re a girl in a remote village, somewhere up a mountain in Timor-Leste. You quit school at third or fourth grade because your mother needs your help in the kitchen and field. You marry young, leave your parents, and move into your husband’s home. His family pays a bride price for you, and by your culture’s standards, you essentially belong to him. You are “not independent to speak,” says Rosaria Martins da Cruz, director of HIAM Health, an NGO that fights malnutrition among mothers and kids. Your husband doesn’t want you to get a job, so you don’t. You have no income of your own. You spend your days in the confines of your hut and your land—caring for kids, tending livestock, weeding the garden. As a rural woman, you are “always in the home to look after the baby, cooking for the man, clean the house, do everything for the man and the kids,” da Cruz says.

Now let’s say it’s an El Niño year (like this one). The rains are late, and drought is expected. Your crops are dying, and people say it’s going to get worse with climate change. You’ve spent the money from last year’s harvest. There is only a little rice to eat, with a few chiles and greens. You feed your husband first. You feed your baby a mush of bland white rice, nothing else. You eat the last dregs yourself, after the others have finished—because that’s tradition, that’s your place in the family. You know it’s not enough nourishment for any of you. You know you’re all getting weaker. You go to church, you pray for rain. When it doesn’t come, sickness does. The neighbor’s baby dies. Then the old woman up the road does, too. You attend each funeral, and go to bed wishing you had the knowledge to make things better, wishing you knew where to begin. The next morning, you wake before dawn to fetch the water, you light the fire, and your daily routine repeats.

This is what it’s like for millions of rural women worldwide who are neither asked nor granted the opportunity to study, to leave the village, to learn and then return to make things better. When women are excluded from education and the pursuit of dreams, their communities are denied 50 percent of all opportunity to innovate and grow. For many women around the globe, their gender presents a double burden: they are born into the lowest rungs of society, and their culture keeps them there with little chance to advance.

This is something we all must work to change, in our homes and our communities—from Timor-Leste to the United States and beyond. We need Feb. 11 as a start to promote women and girls in science. But even more, we need women and girls in science every day, all year long.

"Enzymes and stomach acid break down the oils, carbohydrates, and alcohols while the synthetic or natural rubber base ""passes"" through the digestive system naturally. 
Thank you Pat!",http://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-what-really-happens-to-your-body-when-you-swallow-gum,"You might have heard the rumours as a kid: Swallow gum and it will sit stubbornly in your stomach for seven long years.

But what does science have to say about that? Reactions, a video series from the American Chemical Society, traced the steps taken by our body’s digestive system to find out that while some of the gum we chew can survive digestion, it ""doesn’t mean the gum you swallowed in grade school is still there"". Phew.

Turns out there are three basic components of digestion: The first includes the mechanical processes that are required to process your food when you first ingest it, i.e. chewing.

The second focuses on the enzymes or proteins in your saliva and stomach that help break down that food. Last but not least are acids, which dissolve what’s left into something your body can comfortably pass through your intestines.

Traditionally, when you eat, your teeth and tongue work together to munch the food into small bits. Then your muscle movements push the food through the digestive tract until it is emptied into the stomach and churned with digestive juices, as shown below:

While this is happening, the enzymes in your saliva, stomach juices, and intestines drive chemical processes that allow you to convert that food into nutrients your body can use.

Then, the acids in your stomach get to work, dissolving what’s left of that food into a mush that your body can comfortably pass through your intestines and, eventually… dispose of.

But gum isn’t designed to be smoothly digested by your body like regular food. That’s because it contains either a natural or synthetic rubber base, which is what gives it its gummy consistency. Butyl rubber, commonly used in gum (as well as tires and basketballs, mm!), is a synthetic rubber that provides it with an ideal chewiness.

You’ve probably noticed that gum is unaffected by the crushing of your teeth - that’s kind of the point. So when you swallow the gum, it moves through your digestive tract into your stomach as one giant wad.

While your enzymes are able to break down the carbohydrates, oils, and alcohols in the gum as they would with regular food, the rubber base in the gum is basically immune to these enzymes.

Even the 'harsh brew' of acids in your stomach is no match for this rubber base. (Remember that rubber is so resilient that we use it in gloves for protection.) As a result, part of your gum survives all of your digestive system’s attempts to break it down.

But so do parts of a lot of other things you eat, like sunflower seeds or corn. So while that gum you swallowed is rebellious enough to stand up to your digestive processes, that doesn’t stop your muscles from eventually ushering it through your body and out the other end within a couple days.

"NASA appealed to congress for their next rocket build budget then received an extra $995 million above their request, however they also underwent cuts in areas of research possibly in favor of creating more jobs with the build project. ",https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/nasa-is-a-jobs-program?utm_term=.dxmG6mPKlV#.xhVavmg3eR,"Although NASA touts its discoveries in space, the federal agency is, and has always been, about jobs on the ground. “Money aimed at science and research ends up with builders and contractors instead,” a former NASA deputy administrator said.

NASA / Via nasa.gov One piece of NASA's massive new rocket

Space adventure fans might enjoy NASA’s latest saga, the story of a rocket to nowhere that Congress wants, very badly, built in Alabama. Or they might be really pissed off. In its 2017 budget request, NASA asked Congress for $1.3 billion to build its next jumbo rocket. Last week, despite years of fighting with the Obama Administration over its plans to explore an asteroid with the rocket, the Senate Appropriations Committee not only granted the request, but gave the space agency an extra $995 million to build it. A surprise billion dollars may sound good. But while adding money to “Space Operations,” the Appropriations Committee also cut $660 million from NASA’s science, aeronautics, and space technology programs that build the telescopes, observatories, planes, and landers that make the agency so beloved. In justifying this decision, the committee wrote that the rocket “is the nation’s launch vehicle that will enable humans to explore space beyond current capabilities.” The futuristic space rocket, called the Space Launch System (SLS), won’t send any astronauts into space until at least 2023, and it doesn’t even have a destination. But that doesn’t seem to matter to lawmakers. Since the moon landings ended, NASA is and has always been a jobs program, more about dollars spent on the ground than discoveries made among the stars, with the SLS bonanza just the latest example. “It is more the politics of pork than the politics of progress,” former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver told BuzzFeed News. “There’s a long-time pattern at NASA where money aimed at science and research ends up with builders and contractors instead.”

NASA / Via nasa.gov Ratana Meekham, a technician at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama

The Senate space spending committee is headed by Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, and on the minority side by Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, both of whom have NASA centers in their states. The SLS (nicknamed the “Senate Launch System” after it was forced on NASA in 2010), will be built at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama, where a $45 million 15-story test stand for the rocket reached its intended height earlier this month. “The point is to spend money and create jobs the way the Soviet Union did on its rocket design bureaus,” Keith Cowing of NASA Watch told BuzzFeed News. The SLS — “a rocket to nowhere,” as Cowing put it — fits this pattern neatly because it provides thousands of jobs in space states. No one knows where it will go. Maybe to an asteroid (the Obama administration’s unloved notion), or to circle the moon, or boost astronauts on their way to Mars. Eric Berger, a reporter at Ars Technica decried the move to build the rocket ahead of a destination. Cuts also came to NASA’s “space technology” funding, a $130 million bite meant to keep aloft earth-observing satellites run out of Goddard Space Flight Center, based in Mikulski’s state of Maryland. As Berger said, “the motivation seems primarily to be keeping people employed.”

One problem with this approach is that you might end up with space rocket that doesn’t have any space technology — a habitat module, deep-space propulsion, landers — to actually let astronauts voyage to asteroids, or the moon, or Mars. You might spend billions on workers who maintain the rocket you’ve built, and not have any money left over to build the interplanetary survival gear needed to ever get to Mars, the ultimate goal of the space agency. It’s happened before, Garver said, with the the $100 billion International Space Station. “We had to spend all the money just to get it built, with very little left for science.” Scientists have long complained how little research takes place on the orbiting lab. NASA’s scientific advisory committee decided only this month to send a fact-finding group to the foundation that manages ISS research, after questioning its scientific productivity.

NASA Watch / Keith Cowing / Via nasawatch.com

“The critics are right, this isn’t a rational way to run a space program,” political science professor Harry Lambright of Syracuse University told BuzzFeed News. “But that doesn’t matter, because this is the way a space program will inevitably work in a democracy.” So it has always been for NASA, born in a moment of Cold War lunacy over the Soviet Union claiming the moon for communism, and looking for another space race to justify its budget ever since the glamour of Moon landings first wore off. In the 1960s, NASA administrator James Webb faced declining popular interest in the moon landing, responded by spreading NASA centers to politically important states, such as Lyndon Johnson’s Texas, California, Ohio, and Florida. NASA’s Stennis Space Center, which will build the rocket engines powering the SLS, is located in Mississippi, home to the chairman of the Senate’s overall spending committee, Sen. Thad Cochran. In a sense, that system is still working. NASA built the space shuttle in the 1970s in a decision largely shaped by Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign. Since then, the space agency has had to compete for Congressional dollars like every other federal agency, which means that politicians will always look to jobs as a reason for any Mars landings, Lambright said. “They can’t spend money that Congress doesn’t give them.” So, NASA will at least get a rocket out of the deal, he and others argue. “NASA is actually doing a very good job, in my view, of navigating to build a rocket while they can,"" Lambright said. ""That is what there is money to build."" The real problem, former NASA official Scott Pace of George Washington University told BuzzFeed News, is that the Obama administration’s plans to fly astronauts to an asteroid and then Mars are not very interesting to international or commercial partners, who would rather return to the moon. Building SLS lets NASA keep its options open if the next president decides to look to lunar landings instead, something that Obama seemed to rule out in a 2010 speech. Meanwhile, one commercial partner of NASA appears very much interested in Mars. SpaceX has announced that it will land an unmanned Dragon astronaut capsule on the Red Planet as early as 2018. That landing would depend on its yet-to-be-produced Falcon Heavy rocket, one almost as powerful as the SLS, carrying the capsule to Mars.

Planning to send Dragon to Mars as soon as 2018. Red Dragons will inform overall Mars architecture, details to come

That’s the same SpaceX that on April 8 demonstrated unparalleled rocket landing capabilities, by dropping one of its Falcon rockets onto an ocean barge after sending a satellite into orbit.

Might SpaceX privately building a big rocket in the next two years, and sending something to Mars, make SLS look redundant to politicians, finally ending NASA’s long cycle of rocket-building jobs programs? “That’s kind of optimistic, and I’m an optimist,” said Garver, who served as a space policy advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008. “I wouldn’t count on it.”

Sorry for long post. ",http://www.sciencealert.com/13-amazing-science-facts-you-never-learned-at-high-school,"We learn about some awesome science in high school - like Einstein's theory of relativity, the Periodic table, and DNA replication.

The knowledge we pick up there sets the foundations for all the other amazing things we go on to study. But science definitely doesn't end at high school, and it's once you take your learning to the next level that things get really interesting.

In no particular order, here are some mind-bendingly incredible facts that we didn't learn at high school, but wish we did. Because I certainly would have paid a whole lot more attention if my teacher had shared a few of these insights in class.

Side note: if you did learn about all of this and more at school, then you had a kick-ass teacher and you should probably tell them that.

1. Water can boil and freeze at the same time

Tenstone

Seriously, it's called the 'triple point', and it occurs when the temperature and pressure is just right for the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of a substance to coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. This video shows cyclohexane in a vacuum.

2. Lasers can get trapped in a waterfall

BuzzFeedYellow

Oh my gosh, yes. Not only is this an incredible example of total internal reflection, it also shows how fibre optic cables work to guide the flow of light.

3. We've got spacecraft hurtling towards the edge of our Solar System really, really fast

Clay Bavor/Twitter

We all know rockets are fast, and space is big. But sometimes when we're talking about how long it takes for us to get to distant parts of the Solar System (eight months to get to Mars, are you kidding me?) it can feel like our spacecraft are just crawling along out there.

This gif shows just how wrong that idea is by comparing the speed of the New Horizons probe, which flew past Pluto last year, to a 747 and SR-71 Blackbird.

4. An egg looks like a crazy jellyfish underwater

BIOSstation/YouTube

A cracked egg on land might make a big mess, but 18 metres (60 feet) below the surface of the ocean, the pressure on the egg is 2.8 times atmospheric pressure, and it holds it all together like an invisible egg shell. True story.

5. You can prove Pythagoras' theorem with fluid

00000000130/YouTube

Not buying what your maths teacher is selling when they tell you a2 + b2 = c2? You can actually prove it with liquid.

6. This is what happens when a black hole swallows a star

NASA

As the star gets sucked up into the black hole, a huge jet of plasma is burped out, spanning hundreds of light-years. ""When the star is ripped apart by the gravitational forces of the black hole, some part of the star's remains falls into the black hole, while the rest is ejected at high speeds,"" explains Johns Hopkins University researcher, Suvi Gezari.

7. You CAN see without your glasses

MinutePhysics

According to MinutePhysics, all you need to do is make a pinhole with your hand, which will help you focus the light coming into your retina. Sure, it won't give you 20/20 vision, but it's a good start if you've left your glasses at home.

8. This is how a face forms in the womb

BBC

Embryonic development is an incredibly complex process that scientists are still just beginning to understand. But one thing researchers have been able to map out is how the embryo folds to create the structures of the human face in the womb. We could watch this all day.

9. Popping your knuckles isn't necessarily bad for you

Vox

One researcher popped the knuckles of one hand for 60 years but not the other, and found no discernible difference in the amount of arthritis between the two of them at the end of his experiment.

12. You'd be better off surviving a grenade on land rather than underwater

Mark Rober

Those balloons? That's what would happen to your lungs if an explosion went off near you underwater.

13. If you spin a ball as you drop it, it flies

Veritasium

I mean, it really flies. It's thanks to the Magnus effect, which occurs when the air on the front side of a spinning object is going the same direction as its spin, which means it gets dragged along with the object and deflected back.

Meanwhile, the air on the other side of the ball is moving in the opposite direction, so the air flow separates.

Watch Veritasium explain it better than we ever could:

We could keep going... but the best part about science is that it discovers new things every day. Never stop learning.

“Thai food is delicious but sometimes very greasy,” BBDO writes in a project description, adding that the hundreds of stir-fry and deep fried dishes cooked with oil are one of the reasons that Thais have the second highest obesity rate in Southeast Asia. “Unhealthy eating behaviour is hard to change, and most Thai people go for what’s delicious. How can we help Thai people eat healthier without changing their regular meal?”

But 30 calories per meal is such a negligible amount that this is certainly not a silver bullet. A pound roughly equals 3,500 calories, so a dieter needs to reduce his or her caloric intake by 500 to 1,000 calories per day to lose about 1 to 2 pounds per week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The inhabitants of the Movile Cave are like no others. The “otherworldly” conditions of this Romanian cave, just a few miles west from the Black Sea, have been sealed up for around 5.5 million years. Although the air is poisonous and unbearably humid, this cocktail of factors has created a goldmine for biologists.

Fewer than 100 people have ever delved into the cave, according to BBC Earth . It was only discovered by humans in 1986, when workers of the Socialist Republic of Romania were looking for new ground to build a nuclear power plant. Nowadays, it is blocked off by the authorities and only accessible with special permission, although the central caverns are naturally “guarded” by a series of vertical shafts and narrow limestone tunnels.

Once in the depths of the cave, the air contains half of the amount of oxygen than usual and is high in carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. It is also pitch black and hasn’t seen sunlight for at least 5.5 million years.

"1.Understand and build language
2.Recognise and exploit hidden structures in data.
",http://www.sciencealert.com/what-makes-a-mathematical-genius,"The film The Man Who Knew Infinity tells the gripping story of Srinivasa Ramanujan, an exceptionally talented, self-taught Indian mathematician. While in India, he was able to develop his own ideas on summing geometric and arithmetic series without any formal training.

Eventually, his raw talent was recognised and he got a post at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked with G.H. Hardy until his untimely death at the age of 32 in 1920. Despite his short life, Ramanujan made substantial contributions to number theory, elliptic functions, infinite series, and continued fractions.

The story seems to suggest that mathematical ability is something at least partly innate. But what does the evidence say?

From language to spatial thinking

There are many different theories about what mathematical ability is. One is that it is closely tied to the capacity for understanding and building language. Just over a decade ago, a study examined members of an Amazonian tribe whose counting system comprised words only for 'one', 'two' and 'many'.

The researchers found that the tribe were exceptionally poor at performing numerical thinking with quantities greater than three. They argued this suggests language is a prerequisite for mathematical ability.

But does that mean that a mathematical genius should be better at language than the average person? There is some evidence for this. In 2007, researchers scanned the brains of 25 adult students while they were solving multiplication problems.

The study found that individuals with higher mathematical competence appeared to rely more strongly on language-mediated processes, associated with brain circuits in the parietal lobe.

Srinivasa Ramanujan. wikimedia

However, recent findings have challenged this. One study looked at the brain scans of participants, including professional mathematicians, while they evaluated mathematical and non-mathematical statements.

They found that instead of the left hemisphere regions of the brain typically involved during language processing and verbal semantics, high-level mathematical reasoning was linked with activation of a bilateral network of brain circuits associated with processing numbers and space.

In fact, the brain activation in professional mathematicians in particular showed minimal use of language areas. The researchers argue their results support previous studies that have found that knowledge of numbers and space during early childhood can predict mathematical achievement.

For example, a recent study of 77 eight-to-10-year-old children demonstrates that visuo-spatial skills (the capacity to identify visual and spatial relationships among objects) have an important role in mathematical achievement.

As part of the study, they took part in a 'number line estimation task', in which they had to position a series of numbers at appropriate places on a line where only the start and end numbers of a scale (such as 0 and 10) were given.

The study also looked at the children’s overall mathematical ability, visuospatial skills, and visuomotor integration (for example, copying increasingly complex images using pencil and paper). It found that children’s scores on visuospatial skill and visuomotor integration strongly predicted how well they would do on number line estimation and mathematics.

Hidden structures and genes

An alternative definition of mathematical ability is that it represents the capacity to recognise and exploit hidden structures in data. This may account for an observed overlap between mathematical and musical ability. Similarly, it could also explain why training in chess can benefit children’s ability to solve mathematical problems.

Albert Einstein famously claimed that images, feelings and musical structures formed the basis of his reasoning rather than logical symbols or mathematical equations.

Albert Einstein playing the violin. E. O. Hoppe

However, the extent to which mathematical ability relies on innate or environmental factors remains controversial. A recent large-scale twin and genome-wide analysis of 12-year-old children found that genetics could explain around half of the observed correlation between mathematical and reading ability.

Although this is quite substantial, it still means that the learning environment has an important role to play.

So what does all this tell us about geniuses like Ramanujan? If mathematical ability does stem from a core non-linguistic capacity to reason with spatial and numerical representation, this can help explain how a prodigious talent could blossom in the absence of training.

While language might still play a role, the nature of the numerical representations being manipulated could be crucial.

The fact that genetics seems to be involved also helps shed light on the case – Ramanujan could have simply inherited the ability. Nevertheless, we should not forget the important contribution of environment and education.

While Ramanujan’s raw talent was sufficient to attract attention to his remarkable ability, it was the later provision of more formal mathematical training in India and England that allowed him to reach his full potential.

Lack of love leads to to severe emotional and sensorial deprivation. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/can-lack-love-be-deadly,"I taught myself about orphanages 12 years ago, not actually because of my work as a human biologist but because of my daughter. She was born in 2004 and her first 14 months of life were spent in an orphanage in China.

I am well acquainted with the vast body of research that shows the physical and psychological harms of deprived environments. Orphanages can arguably be placed under this category along with other places such as refugee camps and some hospitals where children lack close contact and attention. Deprivation comes in many shapes and forms: lack of food, diseases, maltreatment, and child abuse are some of the harms that come to mind. However, I would argue that deprivation of love can be just as deadly.

When I started researching orphanages and child health I read the classic works of paediatrician Harry Bakwin, psychologist John Bowlby and psychiatrist Harry Edelston. At the beginning of the 20th century, in the US and the UK, the death rates among infants placed in orphanages, nurseries, and foundling hospitals were, in some cases, close to 100%. London’s Foundling Museum documents in depth these harsh realities. In the 1940s, the work of psychoanalyst Rene Spitz further documented high infant death rates (one out of three) and, among the babies who didn’t die, high percentages of cognitive, behavioural and psychological disfunction.

Most of these deaths were not due to starvation or disease, but to severe emotional and sensorial deprivation – in other words, a lack of love. These babies were fed and medically treated, but they were absolutely deprived of important stimulation, especially touch and affection.

The importance of touch

Human touch is fundamental for human development and survival. Research conducted by Ruth Feldman and Tiffany Field has shown the positive effects that come from skin-to-skin touch in premature babies and that these effects are still at work after ten years. Significant gains in neurological development, weight gain, and mental development of premature babies have been shown to be triggered by skin-to-skin stimulation.

Infants in orphanages can be deprived of touch, individual attention, and love. This happens not because all orphanages are terrible places (although some of them are), but because there are usually too many babies for the staff to manage. In the case of the hospitals, in Europe and the US in the first half of the 20th century, nurses were required to cover their faces with surgical masks and not interact with babies. Parents and other family members were prevented from visiting freely as it was believed this would prevent infections from spreading and help keep babies healthy. However, instead of getting better the babies got worse.

Bakwin understood that this was harmful to the children’s well-being. He stated that “failure of infants to thrive in institutions is due to emotional deprivation"". The term “failure to thrive” is currently used as an umbrella term of conditions, ranging from growth delay, emotional misery and death. It is a generalised health problem seen in high-income and low-income countries although it is more prevalent when poverty and a lack of human resources prevents the babies from receiving emotional and sensorial stimulation (or love) on a daily basis.

My daughter’s story

The reports from our adoption agency guaranteed that the children were well taken care of, fed appropriately, and had toys to play with. But how much sensory stimulation were they given? We knew that the babies were trained, from very early, to hold their feeding bottle on their own. It was not possible to have a carer per child during feeding times.

We flew to China and adoption day finally arrived. Our daughter seemed to be in good health. She adapted herself to us quickly, clearly enjoying the attention we provided, and ate everything we offered. However, on the day we held her for the first time, 90% of the baby girls her age were taller than her. The effects of short height at this age can linger for life and are usually associated with poor health in later life, such as a greater risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease.

Once we got her back home, we were certain that love and bonding would be what she needed most. Three months later, 75% of girls her age were taller than her. Today, at 11 years of age, only 50% of girls her age are taller than her. This is consistent with research that shows a catch-up growth for children who were in orphanages and internationally adopted.

When emotional deprivation and lack of love occur, physical growth slows down or stops. The body enters into a survival mode where vital, basic physiological functions are preserved at the cost of physical, mental, and social development. The longer the child is in survival mode, the more permanent and negative the effects will be. Once a child is adopted and the amount of love, care, and stimulation increases, the body ceases to be in survival mode and will start recuperating.

My husband and I study anthropometry, the study of human body measurements, providing accurate biomedical information on health and nutritional status. We measure our daughter twice a year and compare the results with the World Health Organisation references. But we do not obsess over her measurements. She is a very healthy child, doing well at school in academic subjects, sports, and music. We are now happily bracing for adolescence.

Our daughter’s experience mirrors that of thousands of other babies adopted into loving, well-off families. Increasing awareness on this issue is a step in the right direction, so that more orphaned children receive the happy ending my daughter did.

Could be bad for your health. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/why-you-shouldn-t-wrap-your-food-aluminum-foil-cooking-it,"If you’re baking fish, roasting vegetables or preparing a piece of meat for dinner tonight, chances are that you’ll wrap your food in aluminium foil. What you may not realise is that some of the foil will leach into your meal – and this could be bad for your health.

Research that I conducted with a group of colleagues has explored the use of aluminium for cooking and preparing food. Aluminium doesn’t just appear in foil: it is the most popular cookware material used by people in developing countries. Pots and pans are lined with it and it is found in some kitchen utensils like large serving spoons. Copper used to fulfil this role, but over time it’s been replaced by aluminium because it is cheaper to mass produce and easier to clean.

But while cooking your food in aluminium pots or pans isn’t a bad thing, placing it in foil and putting it in the oven is problematic. This is especially true with acidic or spicy food that’s prepared at high temperatures.

Aluminium and health

Human bodies can excrete small amounts of aluminium very efficiently. This means that minimal exposure to aluminium is not a problem: the World Health Organisation has established a safe daily intake of 40mg per kilogram of body weight per day. So for a person who weighs 60kg the allowable intake would be 2400 mg.",Why You Shouldn’t Wrap Your Food In Aluminum Foil Before Cooking It
Genes. ,http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/why-your-nose-looks-it-does,"Whether you’ve got a button nose, a hook nose, or a Roman nose, you can blame a specific group of five genes for the shape of your honker, according to a new study that appears in the journal Nature Communications.

When it comes to appearances, humans are probably the most diverse species on the planet, coming in all shapes and sizes. This goes as much for our faces as our bodies, and of course one of the most prominent items on the facial landscape is the schnoz.

Differences in nasal design are thought to be driven by a number of evolutionary adaptations, such as the need for nostrils of a particular size in order to control the volume and temperature of inhaled air. The fact that humans tend to recognize each other by sight rather than smell (in most cases!) is another key driver of our wildly varying facey bits.

Surprisingly, these enormous differences in nose shape and size are controlled by a rather small number of genes, which, according to the study authors, encode for specific characteristics such as nostril width, “pointiness,” and the inclination of the bridge of the nose.

To discover this, the researchers looked at photographs of 6,275 people from across Latin America, cross-referencing these images with a full analysis of their genomes, obtained via a DNA sample. In particular, the study authors analyzed 14 different facial traits, seeking out any genetic similarities between people with similar features.

Amazingly, the researchers were able to pinpoint five genes that seem to code for specific nasal traits. For instance, a gene called DCHS2 – which plays a role in controlling cartilage formation – was found to have a major influence over the pointiness of a person’s nose. Another gene, called PAX1, was identified as a driver of nostril breadth, while RUNX2, which is involved in bone growth, is vital for nose bridge width.

This knowledge could have major implications for the treatment of inherited facial deformations. Conditions such as Campomelic Dysplasia, for instance, are associated with a range of craniofacial defects, and are thought to be caused by mutations in genes controlling the development of cartilage.",This Is Why Your Nose Looks Like It Does
Be honest about gaps in employment. ,http://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/news/a20613/resume-gap-study/,"We've all been trained to avoid giving out too much personal information when we're on the job hunt. But according new research from Vanderbilt University, it's better to get real about gaps in your résumé—and being honest could actually land you the job.

""Our study provides the first-ever evidence that women who conceal personal information dramatically lower their hiring prospects,"" says Joni Hersch, professor of law and economics at Vanderbilt Law School, about women who take time away from their careers to raise kids. In other words, being forthright about stepping away from work in favor of family actually works—refreshingly—in women's favor.

I was shocked by the results,"" says Hersch.

Hersch and assistant professor Jennifer Bennet Shinall had 3,022 subjects act as potential employers and asked them to choose between two female job candidates. Each résumé had a 10-year gap in job history. A personal explanation—taking time off to have a child or a get through a divorce—was given for some of the candidates. No explanation was given on the other résumés.

The job-searchers who gave the personal info had a 30-to-40 percent increased chance of being hired, according to the findings.

""I was shocked by the results,"" says Hersch. ""The personal information gave no indication whether the woman would be a more or less productive employee. This was entirely neutral information. Yet the number of people who preferred the woman who explained her résumé gap was staggering.""

"When the bears switch to a leafy, less fibrous diet, they slough off the lining of their gastrointestinal tract ",http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/what-are-there-gooey-masses-panda-poop,"An analysis of giant panda poop has revealed that when the bears switch to a leafy, less fibrous diet, they slough off the lining of their gastrointestinal tract. It then passes through their digestive system and comes out as a gooey mass. The findings, published in Frontiers in Microbiology this month, may help explain why these endangered animals are struggling to reproduce.

Recent work revealed that the digestive systems of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) resemble that of carnivores and omnivorous bears – even though their transition to a vegetarian diet happened some 2 million years ago. Their gut and gut microbes are built for breaking down meat and small amounts of plant matter, yet pandas eat up to a third of their body weight in bamboo every day.

A team led by Garret Suen from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ashli Brown of Mississippi State studied two giant pandas living at the Memphis Zoological Society in Tennessee: a female named YaYa and a male named LeLe (pictured above). The team observed the pandas’ bamboo consumption behavior, and they collected fresh feces (pictured to the right) as well as samples of mucous excretion.

Pandas undergo dramatic seasonal shifts in diet: Most of the time, they eat bamboo stalks, but in August and September, they shift to leaves. Shortly after this summertime shift from woody stalks to less fibrous leaves, the pandas experience episodes of gastrointestinal tract distress, with symptoms ranging from abdominal pain to the excretion of mucous stools containing gelatinous pellets called mucoids. And the pandas stop eating.

After sequencing DNA extracted from stool samples, the team found that microbial diversity is lower in samples collected immediately before mucoid episodes than in the mucoids. Additionally, mucoids contain microbes that are typically found in the gut lining. Together, these findings suggest that mucoids are the expulsion of the internal mucus lining driven by changes in diet.

“What we think might be happening is that their diet is causing a strong internal reaction, leading to an inflammatory response,” Suen explained in a statement. “Pandas are basically shedding their gastrointestinal lining to allow for the replacement of those microbes. It’s kind of like resetting the microbiome.”

The researchers aren’t sure why pandas experience this resetting, and furthermore, this summer shift in food – and the sickness that follows – coincides with the beginning of panda pregnancies. Mucoids are more prevalent following breeding season, and the reduction in nutrition may affect gestation, lactation, and cub development.

Ecuador's Chimborazo is the tallest. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/everest-may-not-be-tallest-mountain-world-after-all,"Here’s an easy question for you: What’s the tallest mountain in the world? If you are wary of being asked such a seemingly simple query, you would be right to be concerned, because the answer is not necessarily Mount Everest.

At a height of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level, it puts other mountains on Earth to shame. However, if you measure this distance out from the center of Earth, thanks to elevated crust near the equator, Ecuador’s Chimborazo is by far the “tallest.”

Measured above sea level, it is only 6,268 meters (20,564 feet) high; when taken from Earth’s core, it is actually 2,168 meters (7,113 feet) higher than Everest would be by this metric. This means that although Everest may be the highest peak on Earth, Chimborazo may in fact be the most prominent – meaning that it “sticks out” more than anything else.

Then there’s the issue of Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on the island of Hawaii. At 4,207 meters (13,803 feet) above sea level, it doesn’t come close to either Everest of Chimborazo using this traditional metric. If the water around it is removed, however, then the height of this once angry mountain is actually around 9,330 meters (30,610 feet). Side by side, Mauna Kea trounces Everest.

The reason this old volcano is so high is because it is sitting on oceanic crust, which is denser than the continental crust that Everest has emerged out of. This means that, even with a massive chunk of rock sitting on top of it, the former cannot be compacted as much as the latter. Ultimately, oceanic crust can support the weight of higher mountains than the continental crust ever could.

In any case, this all pales in comparison to the depths of the deepest point in the ocean. The Challenger Deep, found south of the Japanese archipelago, is 10,984 meters (36,036 feet) below the surface of the ocean. At this depth, it is 2,136 meters (7,000 feet) deeper than Mount Everest is tall.

But why stop at looking at Earth’s features? Thanks to a now-extinguished stationary superheated mantle plume beneath the crust, the Olympus Mons shield volcano on Mars spent millennia piling lava flow after lava flow on top of itself. Nowadays, the extinct edifice is 21,229 meters (69,649 feet) high, which is roughly 2.4 times the height of Everest.

Speaking of volcanoes, Io – the most volcanically active object ever discovered – is currently orbiting Jupiter and spewing out some unbelievably high plumes of sulfurous material. Thanks to explosive volcanic activity at the surface, a nearly non-existent atmosphere providing almost zero resistance, and a low gravitational field strength, some of these plumes can reach heights of 500 kilometers (311 miles).

These gloriously gargantuan columns of volcanic material, some of which have been observed in real-time as they begin to freeze into frigid crystals in space, can fit around 57 Mount Everests inside them. To the Solar System, Everest is a mere molehill.",Everest May Not Be The Tallest Mountain In The World After All
It has a moon. ,https://secondnexus.com/technology-and-innovation/makemakes-moon/,"The dwarf planet Makemake, discovered in 2005, is cold, dark and remote. It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon.

Finding a Dark Moon

Until this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake’s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake’s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake’s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The “dark moon hypothesis” offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. “Imagine that the dark material isn’t on Makemake’s surface… it’s in orbit!” image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. “If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!”

Credit: Source.

Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake’s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden.

MK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don’t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker’s words, “not actually that faint”), but it was easy to miss before.

Part of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake’s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he

thought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, “Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?” When Buie replied, “There’s a moon in the Makemake data?” they knew they’d made a major discovery.

The Moon in the Data

It is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2’s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake’s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place.

However, MK2’s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake’s past atmosphere. If MK2’s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, “The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.” If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts.

The New, Improved Makemake System

While MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, ""The discovery of this moon has given us an

opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.""

Makemake is sometimes referred to as “Pluto’s little sister” because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. “That's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,” Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake.

Looking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system’s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech’s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, “The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. But we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story.” Small worlds like Makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more “exotic” ices and compounds. Since MK2 will allow scientists to tell Makemake’s density and thus the densities of the materials it’s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets.

The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. Even before then, though, information about Makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new Hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. “This new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system,” Buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us.",“Pluto’s Little Sister” Makemake Has Something Even Pluto Doesn't
New Orleans is sinking faster than previously thought. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/some-regions-new-orleans-found-be-sinking-five-centimeters-year,"It was already known the region is sinking, but now NASA has revealed it is happening at higher rate than previously thought. NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri

NASA has confirmed that New Orleans and the surrounding areas are sinking at a much higher rate than previously thought. Using airborne radar to map the rate at which the ground is sinking over a period of a few years, they were able to document in fine detail exactly which regions are most at risk, and where planning and building needs to be monitored.

The Earth’s surface can sink due to a mixture of natural and man-made causes. The weight of deposited sediment can, for example, cause subsidence, as can the movement of glaciers and the compaction of shallow sediments. But humans can also influence this process by pumping out oil and gas, or in the example of New Orleans, by the withdrawal of water.

The extraction of groundwater and dewatering of the region, in which surface water is removed in order to prevent standing water or saturated earth, is causing the city to sink. This has been exasperated by the building of levees, which prevent the natural build-up of sediment that counteract the sinking.

The region of Norco is one of the worst affected, sinking 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri

This is most acute in regions upriver along the Mississippi River, specifically the industrial areas of Norco and Michoud, where the ground is sinking by a worrying 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. Other areas of concern were in New Orleans Upper and Lower 9th Ward, where the subsidence may be related to the water levels of the Mississippi. Of particular concern is the changes in ground level around the levees built to prevent flooding, as they found regions behind the levees sinking by 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) a year.

The data used by NASA to build the maps, published in a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was created using NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), which is able to track changes in elevation on the Earth’s surface down to a centimeter difference. This by itself can’t tell the researchers what is causing the change in ground level, so they then have to disentangle all the possible causes, which operate at different time and space scales.

While the fact that the region is sinking is not new, NASA have highlighted that the degree to which it is happening is much greater than previously thought, and that it could be putting certain regions at a much greater risk of flooding, as if there wasn’t a big enough one to begin with. It is hoped that the data can be used to attempt to reduce or reverse the subsidence in the most severely affected areas, as well as help with planning decisions for the future.",New Orleans Is In Big Trouble

Atmospheric Mirrors caused by Solar Flares. ,http://www.iflscience.com/physics/scientists-finally-solve-50-year-old-mystery-atmospheric-echoes,"Scientists always love a thoroughly mysterious signal. Although one has never been traced back to alien life, terrific planet-wide thunderstorms on alien worlds far from our own have generated detectable radio bursts. Other such signals have been emitted from the heart of our own galaxy, perhaps due to the destruction of dark matter.

A new study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters has claimed to solve the enigma of another of these signals. The so-called “150-kilometer echoes” have been baffling scientists for half a century, but it turns out that every single person on the planet has been looking at the culprit their whole lives.

Every single day at dawn and dusk, the phenomenon rears its head: Radar signals, initially being sent into space by scientists, have been reflecting back towards the ground as echoes. Something at a height of 150 kilometers (90 miles) is acting as a mirror for these signals, and towards noon, the “depth” of the mirror extends downwards to a height of 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 19 miles).

The mirror then rises again towards sunset, where it disappears at night. Probes sent into the atmosphere during sunrise and sunset have failed to identify any potential source of the mirroring effect.

Researchers at Boston University decided to try and identify this mirror once and for all. “When you actually figure out something that nobody’s ever figured out before, that’s when it’s really worthwhile,” Meers Oppenheim, an astronomer at Boston University and joint co-author of the study, said in a statement.

The echoes, tracked throughout the day, at varying altitudes. Oppenheim and Dimant/Jorge Chau/GRL

They noted that the source of the echoes grew more powerful during solar flares and became considerably weaker during eclipses. The researchers also pointed out that the increasing depth of the signal during the day matched the angle of incoming solar radiation. This circumstantial evidence seemed to point to our local star as being potentially culpable, but the signal was unlikely to be coming from the Sun itself.

Ultraviolet light from the Sun is known to tear off the electrons of oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the upper atmosphere, which sends these electrons off at high speeds and with considerable energies. The interactions between these electrons, the electron-stripped molecules (ions) and other particles, are likely to cause the ions to vibrate in batches.

As the study suggests, this mass vibration could generate energetic waves that may be strong enough to reflect radar signals coming from the ground. Using computer simulations to replicate this mechanism, the researchers did indeed show that the energy from the incoming solar radiation is enough to ultimately produce radar-reflecting batches of vibrating ions.

As the Sun rises and moves across the sky during the day, the angle of incoming solar radiation increases, and the vibrating ion batches appear lower in the sky. Towards sunset, the angle decreases, and the “mirror” moves back upwards again. During energetic solar flares, more vibrating ions can be produced, and the mirror becomes more powerful.

Far from just solving a long-held mystery, the team note that this atmospheric mirror, which is easily located, can be used to track the complex movements of atmospheric currents and tides. In any case, this once-mysterious signal is definitely not coming from an alien civilization; perhaps more importantly, it’s not just coming from someone using their microwave at the wrong time of day.",Scientists Have Finally Solved 50-Year-Old Mystery Of Bizarre Signals
Not Yet. ,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/can-paedophilia-really-be-cured-drugs,"According to the Daily Mail, scientists in Sweden are working on a “cure” for paedophilia. The trial involves a drug that disrupts testosterone.

Forcing or persuading children to have sex is one of the worst things a person can do to them. Sexual abuse causes serious emotional and physical harm, and can ruin a child’s capacity to have healthy relationships as an adult. However, we mustn’t confuse all sexual abuse of children with paedophilia.

Paedophiles are sexually attracted to children but they may, or may not, act on their urges. In fact, my experience indicates that most of the people who abuse children are not paedophiles. Research by Alanko and colleagues, looking at the question of whether paedophilia was inherited, showed that approximately 5% of men in the study with paedophilia had offended against children. In fact, people who offend against children, in my experience, are (mostly) men who are obsessed with sex and are looking for a sexual outlet, regardless of the age of the victim.

In our research which looked at whether medication was helpful for sexual offenders who struggled with their obsession with sex, we found that while over 90% of them had committed offences against children, most of them had also abused adults. And, in some cases, victims included both males and females, showing a broad pattern of offending. These abusers will seek out any possible opportunity for sexual satisfaction and sadly children are often vulnerable and easy prey.

Clinicians use the following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria to diagnose paedophilia:

Over a period of at least six months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviours involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger). The person has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. The person is at least age 16 years and at least five years older than the child or children in Criterion A.

Most paedophiles don’t act on their urges

Many researchers think that paedophilia is a sexual orientation (like heterosexuality), rather than a psychosexual disorder or illness. Regardless of which it is, it’s very difficult for people to live with. Discovering at puberty that your sexual preference is for children, is usually a terrifying and depressing realisation.

Think back to when you were 13 or 14 years old and just beginning to become strangely drawn to the boys or girls around you. Now think what it would have been like if those feelings were not for your own peer group, but for much younger children. You might wonder or worry a bit at first, and, as time went on, worry a lot. Why are you so different? What is wrong with you? Who can you talk to about it?

It’s tough enough for teenagers to talk to their parents about sex, let alone tell them they are a paedophile. What we need to do, as a society, is to understand that some people are sexually attracted to children. More than this, we also need to understand that this attraction to children does not bring with it an uncontrollable urge to force sexual attention on children.

Or course, there will be a small number of people who either can’t or won’t control their sexual urges, but for the most part, they can and they will. Think of yourself in a similar situation with your preferred partner type. How easy do you find it to control yourself in a roomful of the type of people you are attracted to? It’s not so difficult to do, is it?

Medication to manage sexual arousal

But what about paedophiles who do act on their urges (as well as sex offenders who prey on children) – do the drugs work for them? As the researcher leading the evaluation of the use of these types of drugs in the UK prison service, I can reassure you that they do reduce people’s obsession with sex.

The drugs seem to work well and it is great that they are being offered (in this case) as a prevention tool. It’s also important that they are offered alongside psychological treatment to further help people control their urges.

As of April 1, 2016, both medication and psychological treatment are also being offered in the UK across the whole of the prison service, and some charities, such as the Safer Living Foundation, are also looking to offer them as a prevention tool for people who have not yet committed an offence.

Keeping children safe

Although testosterone disrupting drugs can help sex offenders control their urges, they may not be a cure for paedophilia. As already described, most people who offend against children are not paedophiles.

Most paedophiles are perfectly capable of controlling themselves and understand the damage that will be done to children by sexual abuse. We need to stop panicking about paedophiles, and focus our efforts on offering treatment and help to anyone struggling with their sexual urges. That’s what will help our children grow up safely.

Warmer sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean. ,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/2016-likely-be-world-s-hottest-year-here-s-why,"We’re not even halfway through the year but already you may have heard talk of 2016 being the hottest on record. But how can scientists be so sure we’re going to beat the previous record, set just last year?

Even before the end of 2015, the UK Met Office was forecasting with 95% confidence that 2016 would beat the record. Since then, that confidence has grown still further, as record after record has tumbled. April 2016 broke the record for the hottest April after we had experienced the hottest February and March on record already this year.

NASA climatologist Gavin Schmidt recently estimated at least a 99% likelihood of 2016 being hotter than 2015.

The Role Of El Niño

The main reason why scientists are so sure that 2016 will be the hottest year is El Niño, which is associated with warmer sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The 2015-16 El Niño was among the strongest on record and has increased global average temperatures.

Even though the El Niño is now decaying, the second year of a major El Niño event is often associated with much warmer than normal conditions and is typically warmer than the first.

For instance, the 1997-98 El Niño was by some measures the strongest on record, and contributed to 1998 becoming the hottest year on record globally at the time.

Since the start of this year, we have seen global temperature records smashed time and time again. This means that much colder temperatures for the second half of the year would be needed for 2016 not to surpass the 2015 record.

Even a strong La Niña event (the cooler opposite of El Niño), which some analysts are forecasting, is unlikely to produce cold enough temperatures.

One thing that could prevent 2016 becoming a record-breaking hot year is a major volcanic eruption in the tropics. Volcanic eruptions at low latitudes can eject aerosols high into the atmosphere reducing the amount of energy from the sun reaching the Earth’s surface.

Previous eruptions such as Pinatubo in 1991 and Tambora in 1815 (which caused 1816 to be “the year without a summer”) reduced temperatures across much of the globe.

However, it is the year after the eruption that often experiences the most severe cooling, so an eruption would have to be pretty soon and very strong to scupper 2016’s chances of being the hottest year on record.

What About Climate Change?

The role of climate change is smaller because we’re comparing 2016 with last year (the previous record). Over such short periods of time, the contribution from global warming doesn’t change much.

However, scientists estimated that 2015 was about 1℃ hotter than it would have been without human-caused climate change. As the human influence on the climate has not increased greatly since last year this 1℃ estimate will also apply to 2016.

The highly likely record temperature of 2016 will join the previous 17 record-breaking hot years back to 1937 which were all made more likely due to human-caused climate change (the rising global temperatures were even noticed as far back as 1938).

So even if El Niño is driving the 2016 record, we can say that the temperatures of this year (and indeed the temperatures associated with all the records over the last few years) would be virtually impossible without climate change.

Climate change has been increasing the likelihood of global temperature records for many decades. The vertical red bars show the record-breaking hot years we can attribute to human-induced climate change. The shorter yellow bars show ranges of estimates for how much more likely a record hot year becomes each year. Andrew King, Author provided

An Omen For The Future?

We expect 2016 to beat the 2015 record for global average temperature as the decaying El Niño event pushes up surface temperatures.

This year, we’ve already seen devastating events associated with unusually warm temperatures, like the mass coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef, which has been largely attributed to human-induced climate change.

In future, we can expect to see more extreme heat events, like we’ve already seen in 2016, impacting society and ecosystems across the world.

And even though 2016 is likely to be the hottest year by some margin, we wouldn’t bet on this record lasting too long. While 2017 is very likely to be cooler due to a possible La Niña, with the strong warming trend the world’s experiencing it’s only a matter of time before we have another record-breaking hot year.

Only if we substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions now will we see the benefit of fewer record heat events in the future.

You may then conclude that heating water results only in hotter water. But at some point everything changes – the water starts to boil, turning from hot liquid into steam. Physicists call this a “phase transition.”

Automation, driven by technological progress, has been increasing inexorably for the past several decades. Two schools of economic thinking have for many years been engaged in a debate about the potential effects of automation on jobs, employment and human activity: will new technology spawn mass unemployment, as the robots take jobs away from humans? Or will the jobs robots take over release or unveil – or even create – demand for new human jobs?

The debate has flared up again recently because of technological achievements such as deep learning, which recently enabled a Google software program called AlphaGo to beat Go world champion Lee Sedol, a task considered even harder than beating the world’s chess champions.

Ultimately the question boils down to this: are today’s modern technological innovations like those of the past, which made obsolete the job of buggy maker, but created the job of automobile manufacturer? Or is there something about today that is markedly different?

Malcolm Gladwell’s 2006 book The Tipping Point highlighted what he called “that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.” Can we really be confident that we are not approaching a tipping point, a phase transition – that we are not mistaking the trend of technology both destroying and creating jobs for a law that it will always continue this way?

Old worries about new tech

This is not a new concern. Dating back at least as far as the Luddites of early 19th-century Britain, new technologies cause fear about the inevitable changes they bring.

It may seem easy to dismiss today’s concerns as unfounded in reality. But economists Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University and Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University argue, “What if machines are getting so smart, thanks to their microprocessor brains, that they no longer need unskilled labor to operate?” After all, they write:

Smart machines now collect our highway tolls, check us out at stores, take our blood pressure, massage our backs, give us directions, answer our phones, print our documents, transmit our messages, rock our babies, read our books, turn on our lights, shine our shoes, guard our homes, fly our planes, write our wills, teach our children, kill our enemies, and the list goes on.

Looking at the economic data

There is considerable evidence that this concern may be justified. Eric Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of MIT recently wrote:

For several decades after World War II the economic statistics we care most about all rose together here in America as if they were tightly coupled. GDP grew, and so did productivity — our ability to get more output from each worker. At the same time, we created millions of jobs, and many of these were the kinds of jobs that allowed the average American worker, who didn’t (and still doesn’t) have a college degree, to enjoy a high and rising standard of living. But … productivity growth and employment growth started to become decoupled from each other.

Lots more productivity; not much more earning. U.S. Department of Labor Statistics

As the decoupling data show, the U.S. economy has been performing quite poorly for the bottom 90 percent of Americans for the past 40 years. Technology is driving productivity improvements, which grow the economy. But the rising tide is not lifting all boats, and most people are not seeing any benefit from this growth. While the U.S. economy is still creating jobs, it is not creating enough of them. The labor force participation rate, which measures the active portion of the labor force, has been dropping since the late 1990s.

While manufacturing output is at an all-time high, manufacturing employment is today lower than it was in the later 1940s. Wages for private nonsupervisory employees have stagnated since the late 1960s, and the wages-to-GDP ratio has been declining since 1970. Long-term unemployment is trending upwards, and inequality has become a global discussion topic, following the publication of Thomas Piketty’s 2014 book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century.

A widening danger?

Most shockingly, economists Angus Deaton, winner of the 2015 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, and Anne Case found that mortality for white middle-age Americans has been increasing over the past 25 years, due to an epidemic of suicides and afflictions stemming from substance abuse.

Is automation, driven by progress in technology, in general, and artificial intelligence and robotics, in particular, the main cause for the economic decline of working Americans?

In economics, it is easier to agree on the data than to agree on causality. Many other factors can be in play, such as globalization, deregulation, decline of unions and the like. Yet, in a 2014 poll of leading academic economists conducted by the Chicago Initiative on Global Markets regarding the impact of technology on employment and earnings, 43 percent of those polled agreed with the statement that “information technology and automation are a central reason why median wages have been stagnant in the U.S. over the decade, despite rising productivity,” while only 28 percent disagreed. Similarly, a 2015 study by the International Monetary Fund concluded that technological progress is a major factor in the increase of inequality over the past decades.

The bottom line is that while automation is eliminating many jobs in the economy that were once done by people, there is no sign that the introduction of technologies in recent years is creating an equal number of well-paying jobs to compensate for those losses. A 2014 Oxford study found that the number of U.S. workers shifting into new industries has been strikingly small: in 2010, only 0.5 percent of the labor force was employed in industries that did not exist in 2000.

The discussion about humans, machines and work tends to be a discussion about some undetermined point in the far future. But it is time to face reality. The future is now.

Artificial Sweetener. ,http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/fda-warns-artificial-sweetener-can-be-fatal-dogs,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released an official warning to dog owners on the dangers of xylitol, an artificial sweetener used in many household products. While safe for humans, the ingredient can be fatal for their furry companion.

The toxicity of xylitol for dogs has been known for some time, but this is the first official advisory from the FDA. The warning comes amid an increase in the number of dogs accidentally poisoned by xylitol – a figure that has increased from 82 cases in 2004 to more than 3,700 in 2014.

Products that contain xylitol include sugar-free gum, certain baked goods, cough syrup, chocolate bars, children’s and adult chewable vitamins, mouthwash, and toothpaste.

If ingested by your pet pooch, the sweetener can cause their pancreas to rapidly release insulin, dropping their blood sugar to dangerously low levels – all within 10 to 60 minutes of consumption.

“In people, xylitol does not stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas. However, it’s different in canines: When dogs eat something containing xylitol, the xylitol is more quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, and may result in a potent release of insulin from the pancreas,” wrote the FDA in a statement. This results in hypoglycemia, a possibly life-threatening condition if not treated.

Depending on the amount consumed, side effects can take up to 12 to 24 hours to appear, so it is best to stay vigilant during this time. Symptoms to look for include vomiting, weakness, staggering, lack of coordination, collapse, and seizures. If your dog has consumed xylitol, take your pet to the nearest vet or emergency animal hospital.

Other items that dogs should not eat include grapes, raisins, alcohol, onion, garlic, macadamia nuts, avocados, and caffeine. As a side note, the FDA said they do not know whether xylitol is poisonous to cats, as they tend to show disdain for sweets.

The takeaway: There is nothing sweet about giving your dog artificial sweetener, so keep your gum and chocolate bars out of paws reach.",FDA Warns Common Food Ingredient Can Be Fatal To Dogs
It crushes the diamond. ,http://www.iflscience.com/physics/hydraulic-press-channel-takes-one-natures-hardest-materials,"The Hydraulic Press Channel has had a meteoric rise to fame over the past few months, simply by satisfying our appetite for mindless destruction and showing millions of people how amazing Finnish accents are. So far, it’s squished everything from bowling balls to non-Newtonian fluid . But now they must face nature's hardest substance: diamond.

The diamond was donated to the channel by a generous diamond retailer looking to jump on the viral bandwagon. As stated in the video, it’s a 1.2 carat jewel and worth at least $4,000, complete with its own certificate to prove it’s the real deal.

So, as Lauri Vuohensilta – the mad genius behind the channel – says in the video: “They say diamonds are forever, but how long?”

As it turns out, not very long.

So, how was the diamond broken so easily? As some have pointed out, the “hardness” that diamonds are known for only really refers to their ability to be scratch-resistant. While the covalent bonds between the diamond atoms themselves are extremely strong, diamonds can also be brittle, especially if there’s any kind of defect or it’s been poorly cut. Scientists have even discovered materials that are actually harder than diamonds, such as wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite.

Nevertheless, it’s still pretty impressive how swiftly the hydraulic press manages to shatter the diamond. That, and the ""bonus crushing"" of the plasticine model at the end is a particularly good one.",Watch What Happens If You Put A Diamond In A Hydraulic Press

The first attack struck while Dickson, then 23 and just back from a vacation in South Africa, was attending a party in New York. She assumed that the piercing abdominal pains might be a legacy of her trip or, more likely, the consequence of bad sushi she had consumed before the party.

As the pain worsened, Dickson remembers wondering, “Is this what childbirth is like?” The next morning she saw her family doctor in New Jersey, who sent her to the hospital for tests. Soon afterward, the symptoms disappeared, and when testing revealed nothing, Dickson said she “moved on.”

Six months later, she experienced a second episode, followed by another a year later. The third attack would end far differently than the first two: Doctors at a New Jersey hospital decided that, based on the results of her CT scan, Dickson needed emergency surgery.

[Doctors dismissed his pain as migraines. Then they said he had 24 hours to live.]

Johanna Dickson thought her excruciating stomach pains were caused by food poisoning at first. It soon became clear the issue was more serious, but Dickson's eventual diagnosis shocked both her and her doctors. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)

“Something like this is very strange in a 24-year-old,” said Kenneth A. Goldman, the surgeon who operated on Dickson in August 2008. Goldman said he approached her case with some trepidation, “hoping for the best and assuming the worst.”

For Dickson, who now works as a book publicist in Manhattan, the first episode was a surprise. She had felt fine on vacation and been generally healthy during the previous year she had spent in South Africa on a college study program. Because she had worked with orphans who had HIV, Dickson underwent testing for infectious diseases after she returned to the United States from her year abroad. “I assumed if there was anything serious, I’d find out about it,” she recalled.

The second attack, which caused stabbing pain so intense it woke her from sleep, passed fairly quickly; this time, she didn’t go to the doctor.

But the pain during the third episode was much worse. Dickson, who was then living with her parents near Princeton, said that it began in the middle of the night and grew so unbearable that she began screaming. Her mother held her and tried to soothe her; in the morning, her parents rushed her to the doctor’s office.

He decided that Dickson probably had food poisoning — she had bought fruit from a street vendor the previous day. Although her pain, which was mostly on her left side, seemed somewhat lessened, the doctor told Dickson’s parents that if it didn’t subside by noon, she should go to the hospital for an abdominal CT scan. One possibility was acute appendicitis, although that typically causes pain on the right side.

[He couldn’t eat, drink or work. And doctors couldn’t explain his searing pain.]

Dickson was little better by noon, and her parents took her to the hospital. Several hours later, an ER doctor entered the room and asked a series of rapid-fire questions. “He wanted to know if I’d ever given birth, or had surgery or had a family history of colon problems,” Dickson recalled.

He had swollen thumbs, bleeding gums and anemia. He cried whenever anyone touched his legs. Doctors were running out of time. Read the case Cam Cottrill/For The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

The answer to each question was no.

“Why?” Dickson remembers her father inquiring.

The doctor explained that the CT scan showed that Dickson’s pain was the result of a serious bowel obstruction. The most likely cause at her age was scar tissue from previous surgery. Another possibility was an inflammation of her colon. Because Dickson had never had any surgery — she had never been in a hospital — and no history of colon problems, doctors had no idea what was causing the obstruction. A surgeon was on his way to see her and would decide whether she needed an operation or whether the problem might resolve without it.

[A simple test proved that a teen with stomach pain wasn’t a hypochondriac after all]

A bowel obstruction occurs when the large or small intestine is partially or totally blocked, preventing food, fluids and gas from passing normally. It typically causes severe pain that may wax and wane.

Through a morphine haze, Dickson remembers feeling terrified about the prospect of surgery. Goldman told Dickson and her parents that surgery was essential. “I remember hearing something about my intestine being really badly tangled and that it was something you [usually] see in people over 60.”

The primary concern was that the obstruction was cutting off the blood supply to Dickson’s colon; an operation to untwist the intestine and relieve the obstruction was the only treatment. Causes of a blockage include a hernia; Crohn’s disease, a disorder that causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract; previous abdominal surgery, including a Caesarean section, which results in the formation of scar tissue; and a tumor.

Goldman remembers wondering what he would find. “I’ve seen 25-year-olds with metastatic colon cancer,” he said.

Shortly before 7 p.m., Dickson was wheeled into surgery.

A surprising discovery

In the operating room, Goldman discovered the source of the obstruction: a tumor the size of a plum in Dickson’s small intestine. He sent samples of the tumor — called frozen sections — to the pa­thol­ogy lab and waited for the initial report.

[She couldn’t stop coughing. Were fragrances to blame?]

The pathologist found that the specimen contained abnormally shaped spindle cells — round in the middle with pointed ends. Because such a finding is rare and its implications unclear, Dickson’s pa­thol­ogy samples were subsequently sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for a second opinion. In the meantime, Goldman decided that in case Dickson did have an invasive cancer, he needed to remove enough of her intestine — about 10 inches — to ensure that no malignancy remained. Dickson said she suffered no ill effects from the surgery.

The next morning, Dickson recalled, Goldman explained that the first two episodes had probably been caused by the bowel partially twisting around the tumor and then untwisting. Once the tumor grew too large, surgery was essential.

The Mayo pathologists classified the tumor as an extremely fibrous growth called a desmoid, a slow-growing mass that typically affects women younger than 40.

Because the tumor was attached to the mesentery, the fold of tissue that connects the small intestine to the abdominal wall, the condition is also called mesenteric fibromatosis. About 900 desmoid tumors are diagnosed annually in the United States.

There is disagreement about whether such tumors should be classified as benign — largely because they do not spread — or as a low-grade form of cancer. Dickson said she was told her tumor was benign.

Surgery to remove desmoid tumors is the preferred treatment, but recurrence is common. Many desmoid tumors, which can develop anywhere in the body, have no known cause. Some occur in people with Gardner syndrome, a type of familial adenomatous polyposis, a genetic disorder that results in frequent colon polyps in adolescence and in early-onset colon cancer.

[Why I hid my daughter’s medical diagnosis from her for as long as I could]

No recurrence

But in Dickson’s case, no genetic link could be found.

Dickson said she underwent frequent monitoring the year after her surgery as well as a colonoscopy, which found nothing. She sees an oncologist periodically for follow-up, but so far the tumor has not recurred.

In 2013, five years after the surgery, Dickson underwent a second abdominal operation, which involved removal of more of her intestine, to relieve pain caused by scar tissue from the 2008 operation.

“I thought, ‘Oh, my God, am I going to be doing this every five years?’ ” she remembered wondering. There is no way to prevent a recurrence — doctors don’t know what caused the tumor — but Dickson said she is careful about her diet, avoiding fried foods and dried fruit, which she has trouble digesting.

These days stomachaches always get her attention.

“If Pepto [Bismol] doesn’t work after about 20 minutes,” she said, “I do get a little nervous.”

To Goldman, Dickson remains a singular event in his long surgical career. “I’ve seen one case of this in my 32 years,” he said. “That was Johanna.”",Doctors were startled to find the cause of this 24-year-old’s excruciating pain

Go to college. Get your career established. Date around. Find out what you’re looking for in a life partner. Wait to get married.

That’s been the prevailing logic when it comes to minimizing your odds of divorce for some time now. But in a study released last month, University of Utah researcher Nicholas Wolfinger, PhD, asserts there is actually an optimal age range for lasting marriage — and you shouldn’t wait too long. He found that likelihood of divorce is lowest when you get hitched between the ages of 28 and 32.

Wolfinger, an adjunct professor of sociology at the university, had previously found a U-shaped relationship between age at marriage and likelihood of divorce by looking at data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) back in 2006 to 2010. The NSFG polled more 22,000 men and women aged 15 to 44 on topics ranging from factors determining marriage and divorce, to attitudes about sex and pregnancy.

Ever the good researcher, Wolfinger wanted to see if he could replicate those initial findings by pulling additional NSFG stats from 2011 to 2013. He got nearly identical information: Age 28 through 32 is the sweet spot for marriage — get married before or after that, and risk of splitting from a spouse increases.

“The odds of divorce decline as you age from your teenage years through your late twenties and early thirties,” Wolfinger writes. “Thereafter, the chances of divorce go up again as you move into your late thirties and early forties.” After age 32, divorce risk climbs about 5 percent each year.

But not so fast. Wolfinger’s findings are something to consider, sure — but they’re not a reason to freak out.

Related: The Best Times and Places to Have Major Relationship Conversations

There have been some naysayers of the findings, notably Phillip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. He has found a slightly older “perfect marriage” age range, using different data than Wolfinger. He found there’s, ultimately, no reason to worry if you get married later on. Cohen’s stats were from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, sent out to 295,000 American households per month to collect ongoing data on social, economic, and housing characteristics of individual communities.

Story continues

And here’s another very important thing to point out about Wolfinger’s study: It only looks at divorce during the first five years after marriage, says psychologist Karla Ivankovich, an adjunct professor at the University of Illinois at Springfield. Ideally, a marriage is going to last longer than half a decade. “So there is still possibility of divorce, just not in the time frame identified within the study,” she tells Yahoo Health.

In a way, that 28-to-32 demographic does make sense. By that age, you know a lot more about who you are, what you want out of life, and what you want in a life partner, than you did in your early 20s.

Interestingly, Marisa T. Cohen, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at St. Francis College and co-founder of the Self-Awareness and Bonding Lab, has polled the masses on this very subject: What’s the best age to get married? She found daters are pretty in sync with Wolfinger’s findings: After examining opinions from 773 people, “an overwhelming majority — 83.7 percent — felt that it is ideal to get married in between 25 to 34 years of age,” she tells Yahoo Health.

But even though getting married in this age range is something we say we want, that doesn’t mean this is the time all of us are universally ready for marriage, she caveats. “You need to be committed in order to make a marriage work. Some of the causes of divorce, besides infidelity, are lack of communication, being incompatible partners, and growing apart,” Cohen notes. “Basically, if you don’t know who you are as a person, you won’t be a good partner.”

Instead of focusing on age as the decider of when to get married, we should instead focus on social environments and life experiences — and growing out of that “emerging adulthood” phase, which generally rolls through our post-grad, mid-20s years — to determine when marriage is appropriate.

What we do know: Younger marriages are more likely to end, research shows — and the reason is the romantic landscape in a person’s early dating years. “We aren’t just seeing a change in the overall divorce rate and an increase in the divorce rate of those who marry young, but overall we are seeing a shift in the basic way in which people court one another,” Cohen explains. “What was once dating and courting, is now more of a ‘hookup’ culture in college. What was once getting to know you, your values and morals, is now right and left swipes.”

It takes time to get all those “options” out of your system, and settle on the person who is right for you. And it’s not just the romantic aspects of marriage, but also the practical ones, that come into consideration. It takes time to come to fully bear all the responsibilities Mom and Dad had been shouldering before — like car payments, rent, insurance, general life decisions — and all that takes place during this “emerging adulthood” period.

Now for the other side of that 28-to-32 group. If you choose to get married at an older age, you have been flying solo much longer, says Carin Goldstein, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in Santa Monica, California. “You’re pretty set in your ways,” she tells Yahoo Health. “You’re less willing to compromise or accommodate a partner’s opinion into your own. When you’ve been supporting yourself and making your own decisions for years, it’s harder to get used to the idea of someone else’s opinion.”

Now that we’ve looked at the logic behind the magical “28 to 32,” it’s time to examine why getting hitched before or after that age range is by no means a death sentence for your marriage. (Do relax.) In fact, that range won’t be right for everyone.

Ivankovich compares determining the ideal age a person should get married to spinning the mystery wheel at your favorite casino. “It is not so much a number, but dependent on an individual’s maturity, and ability to commit to a long-term relationship,” she explains. “Prior experiences with marriage — how [a person was] raised, psychosocial situations, religious factors, you name it — all impact readiness.”

Indeed, there are many factors that determine marital success, according to Liz Keneski, a PhD candidate in human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. She’s conducted work alongside Tim Loving, PhD, an associate professor in the School of Human Ecology at the university, examining the recipe for marital success.

One major predictor: how family and friends in the couple’s sphere of influence view the developing relationship. “People readily recognize norms for relationship development — or how relationships ‘should’ go, based on what’s typical for our society,” Keneski tells Yahoo Health.

For instance, according to Keneski and Loving’s work, couples’ friends and family members report liking a loved one’s partner more when they perceive the relationship is progressing normatively (a.k.a. nothing out of the ordinary, no apparent red flags). “They report doing things to show their support for the relationship more, too, like inviting the loved one’s partner over for an event, hugging the partner, or asking about the partner,” Keneski says.

In other words, people really like when relationships follow the “typical” script — and just like friends and family, we probably like to see that regular progression in our own relationships, too. Keneski and Loving have found that dating milestones matter a great deal, checking boxes like first kiss, first intercourse, meeting one another’s friends and parents (and so forth), in a steady order. However, what seems to matter is the order of these events and how well they go — and not necessarily how fast they occur.

No matter your age, you have to be open to amending your timeline to marriage a bit. Everyone’s journey to the altar, should they want to reach it, is very personal. But here are some areas of focus couples must work on to make a marriage last at any age.

Early on: Smell the roses.

Early in your marriage — especially if you marry in or before that “sweet spot” — Ivankovich suggests taking some time for yourselves as a couple. Plan for the future, instead of rushing through it. Discuss family, instead of starting one. Travel the world, instead of settling in one place. In other words: Stop and smell the roses. “Life is just beginning, so take a moment to explore before settling down,” she explains. “Learn about careers, enjoy time together.” There will be lots of time to establish yourselves.

As you grow: Build strong relationships apart from your significant other.

Keneski says that, ironically, a strong pairing is not just about two people. “Working on your relationship with your partner is certainly paramount in creating a great foundation for a relationship,” says Keneski, “but don’t forget to foster strong relationships with friends and family outside of your relationship. What they think of your relationship and how they interact with you and your partner matters for the happiness of your relationship.”

As you add family: Flexibility goes a long way.

Ivankovich says that the more you are able to roll with the punches and make adjustments to your plan, the happier you will be — especially as you begin to factor kids and family into the equation. “Long-term plans involve love,” she says. “Take some time to create a map for the future and consider how this will impact a life that involves family — but be willing to adapt to whatever life throws your way.”

As you mature: Decide to stay married…

Marriage and family therapist Jodie Voth says she’s polled couples in the later stages of their relationships, asking them how they’d made it last. “I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again,” she tells Yahoo Health. “If ‘marriage forever’ is your goal, every successful couple past 40 years of marriage has told me the same thing: It is a decision to stay married. Not romance, not flexibility, not negotiation or communication skills — it is a decision. Sometimes, every day.” So, the next time you two get into an argument and cannot see eye-to-eye? Voth says you say, “I’m gonna stick this out, because I want to be married to this person for the rest of my life.” And then, you keep working on it.

… And don’t foster contempt.

While deciding to stay married is hardly romantic, Voth says studies from psychologist John Gottman reveal what can make the whole experience much happier — and more likely to remain intact, too. “His research tells us that allowing yourself to be influenced by your partner and refraining from contemptuous behavior are what make marriages last,” she explains. “So, yes, keep divorce off the table — but also be open to hearing your partner’s opinion, and stop rolling your eyes and using sarcasm to communicate.” Marriage is more pleasant if you work together constructively. Leave contempt at the door.

Not making your bed exposes dust mites to air/sunlight and kills them. ,http://www.domain.com.au/advice/why-you-should-never-make-your-bed-20151001-gjy8f6/,"People often tell you to make your bed because it ‘starts the day off well’ or that it brings order and calm.

But the lazy among us have always known making your bed is a bad idea.

For starters, it’s difficult to see the point of arranging all your throw pillows and stuffed animals on the bed if you’re only going to push them off hours later.

If you have to leave the house early in the morning you’re probably all bleary-eyed and you don’t have the time or desire for tackling chores.

Even if you thought about making your bed, as soon as someone nags you to do it, that immediately makes you not want to do it. It’s all very complicated.

Plus, it’s harder to get comfortable in your bed if it’s been made and the sheets are firmly tucked in. (I like to create a cocoon out of blankets and fold all the sheets up around my legs, to the point where it’s stupidly warm, which is why bed-making is not for me.)

Another thing to consider: if you make your bed in the morning, that means you’re telling yourself that you won’t be getting back into it for the rest of the day, and you just don’t need to place those boundaries on yourself.

Finally, all these very valid points have now also been backed up by scientific evidence. Thanks science.

According to reports, making your bed every morning may be bad for your health.

The reason is dust mites; they don’t just look nasty, they are nasty.

In the average bed there’s as many as 1.5 million microscopic mites crawling around and feasting off the skin cells you shed while you sleep.

In the morning, if you make your bed immediately, all of the skin cells, sweat, mites and their droppings – which can cause asthma and allergies – will be trapped underneath.

However, if the bed is left unmade, the mites, dead skin, the sweat, all of it, will be exposed to fresh air and light.

So, if you have to make your bed it is better to wait until the evening. By that point your bed is much less appealing to dust mites and they will have died from dehydration or just lost interest.

What you should do to mitigate allergies is wash your sheets every one-to-two weeks, use a damp mop or rag to remove dust and encase your mattress and pillows in dust-proof or allergen impermeable covers.

There you have it. You’re welcome.",Why you should never make your bed
You can't react fast enough. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/watch-there-s-a-mathematical-reason-for-why-you-can-t-catch-a-dollar-bill-in-your-fingers,"Here's a life tip for you - if a stranger ever comes up to you in the street, telling you he'll give you a dollar bill for free, and all you have to do is catch it between your fingers when he drops it, get the hell out of there, it's a trap!

Seriously though, test it out with a friend, and unless you're an exceptional human being, you will never ever catch that dollar bill. But don't feel bad - there's a mathematical reason for why it can't be done, and it's rooted in the biological fact that the reaction time for most humans is about 0.2 seconds.

Yep, 0.2 seconds approximately how long it takes for you to see something, process it, and physically react to it, which is actually pretty impressive when you think about it. But that's not nearly quick enough for your eyes to see that falling dollar bill, and have your brain to process that information, and instruct your fingers to snap together in time to catch it.

So case closed, right? Well not quite, because you're perfectly capable of catching things on the fly - humans aren't completely useless - so why not some sweet, sweet cash?

As the Numberphile video above explains, it all comes down to some good old high school maths. We all know that when we drop an item from a height, you can figure out the time it will take to get to the ground based on the falling velocity and the distance travelled. Or you can figured out the distance travelled based on the falling velocity and time it takes to get to the ground.

You just need to use an equation like this, D = 1/2 gt2, where D = distance, t = time, g = gravititation acceleration, and gt = falling velocity. On Earth, gravitational acceleration is measured at 9.8 m/s2, but for the purposes of this calculation, Numberphile mathematician Tadashi Tokieda has rounded that value up to 10.

If all that is giving you maths homework nightmares, don't worry, the video above does all the work. Just sit back, relax, and feel smart by osmosis.

So when you use this equation to figure out a distance based on the human reaction time of 0.2 seconds and gravitational acceleration value of 10, you get 0.2 metres, or 20 cm.

If you measure a dollar bill, you'll find that it's around 15 cm long, which means that if someone is holding it at 5 cm or less above your fingers, it's pretty much impossible for you to react fast enough to catch it. Curse you, slow mortal brain!

But don't give up just yet, because there is hope if your one dream in life is to catch falling money between your fingers.

You'll have to watch the Numberphile video above to find out why even someone without above average reaction times could improve their chances of achieving this feat, but let's just say if you do agree to that stranger's bet in the street, make sure he lets you choose which fingers to use.

"Without a GPS, scent. ",http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/how-dogs-find-their-way-home-without-gps,"Animals’ ability to navigate long distances has long been shrouded in mystery. From the skill of racing pigeons to find their way home, to the seasonal breeding migration of the humpback whale, a huge range of creatures are capable of navigating in a consistent, precise and effective way.

Science has been slow to fully identify and understand the processes and cues involved in animal migration. However, evidence now suggests that a vast array of species, from beetles to birds to dogs, demonstrate amazing abilities to travel long distances, without the use of electronic GPS – something many humans have perhaps become over-reliant upon.

In April, the story of Pero, an adventurous four-year-old working sheepdog was reported. Pero managed to find his way from Cockermouth in Cumbria back to his previous home, near Aberystwyth, on the coast of mid Wales. In a real-life story reminiscent of “Lassie Come Home”, Pero somehow navigated about 240 miles in two weeks. Significantly, his microchip confirmed this was not a case of mistaken identity, this young sheepdog really had made it back to his first home.

Stories like that of Pero’s often attract media interest, leaving readers puzzled over how an animal can travel so far. Without speculating over whether the dog had been simply dropped off at the farm by someone who recognised him, these sorts of tales apparently prove the remarkable nature of animal instincts. The deep relationship between people and their dogs also seems to drive a desire to believe that there is something magical about this ability. So, is this navigation skill because of “personal bonds” between owner and dog, or is there a scientific understanding of the biology involved?

Sniffing out adventure. www.shutterstock.com/Kevin Lobene

A huge variety of animals use a number of different sensory systems in order to travel distances. Desert ants, for example, use environmental olfactory cues and odour plumes – clouds of scent dispersed by the wind moving odour molecules – to navigate their way both to food sources and back to their nests. Honeybees appear able to recall routes to feeding sites when exposed to scent from that location. Other species such as sea turtles, some amphibians, spiny lobsters and birds are able to use magnetic positional information to migrate or orientate towards specific target locations. This latter ability to exploit geomagnetic information is significant, as it is unlikely to be affected by weather conditions, cycles of light and dark, seasonality or global position in the same way that other cues might be affected.

In addition to a “magnetic compass”, birds also appear to use sun and star “compasses” for navigation. Parasitic nematode worms are capable of moving towards new hosts by responding to seismic vibrations and other species use vibrations for prey capture. Bats, birds and marine mammals can also identify location and travel with the help of sonar and infrasound, while visual landmarks appear critical for species such as ourselves.

Pero’s tale.

But just how did Pero find his way home? It is likely that many animals, including dogs, navigate using an integration of many of the internal systems and external signals mentioned above. Dogs are also very reward driven – so positive associations with particular places or people are likely to result in a desire to return. The intense olfactory ability of dogs is also likely to assist location awareness – my own dogs appear to “smell” the beach miles before we actually see it.

Interestingly, recent evidence that dogs and some primates possess a molecule associated with magnetoreception – the ability to sense a magnetic field – might further explain Pero’s return home. Cryptochrome 1 is a light-sensing molecule that regulates circadian rythmns in species as diverse as plants and fish. It seems that this molecule is present in the retinal cone cells of a range of other species too, including dogs, foxes, wolves, bears and badgers. It has also been identified in some primate species including the Bornean orangutan.

The reason for the presence of this molecule remains undetermined and researchers have acknowledged that it might not be related to magnetoreception. However, the identification of cryptochrome 1 in the photoreceptors of these mammals' eyes is identical to the location of the same molecule in birds. This might suggest that the ability to respond to magnetic positional information is maintained in birds and some mammals. Indeed, magnetoreception has been documented in different mammal species, leading to the suggestion that dogs might even defecate in response to the earth’s magnetic field.

It is interesting to note that researchers have as yet failed to identify this molecule in species such as bats, an animal already known to be capable of navigating using magnetic fields. Perhaps some species have evolved different ways to use magnetic fields to identify location, or, alternatively, a range of interacting biological processes may be involved.

It is important to remember however, that Pero and other animals reported as having travelled miraculous distances tend to be the exception rather than the rule. For every amazing story of a pet dog or cat travelling huge distances to return “home”, there are many more who are quite simply, lost. For those animals, even a deep bond with their human caregiver is not enough to drive or facilitate a long-distance return.

So while there does appear to be some fundamental biology that means even our domesticated species can navigate long distances, nailing down the exact science that enabled Pero’s exceptional feat of navigation remains tricky.

"It has to do whether or not you think people, especially yourself, can change. ",http://time.com/4198374/psychology-past-romance/?xid=time_socialflow_facebook,"A friend once grumbled that, given the choice, she’d rather see her ex miserable than herself happy.

Few things in life are as traumatic as the end of a long-term, romantic relationship. Nonetheless, many people are able to eventually recover and move on relatively unscathed.

Others, like my friend, aren’t so lucky. Even years later, they remain mired in the pain of the experience. Any reminder of their former partner – whether it’s a casual mention in conversation or a Facebook photo – can elicit profound feelings of sadness, anger and resentment.

Why is it that some people continue to be haunted by the ghosts of their romantic pasts, struggling to let go of the pain of rejection?

In new research, my colleague Carol Dweck and I found that rejection actually makes some people redefine themselves—and their future romantic prospects.

In one study, we asked people to write about any lessons they’d taken away from a past romantic rejection. Analyzing their responses, we realized that a number of respondents thought the rejection unmasked a basic negative truth about themselves—one that would also sabotage their future relationships. Some said they’d realized that they were too “clingy.” Other thought they’d been “too sensitive” or “bad at communicating.”

Additional studies explored the consequences of believing that rejection had revealed a fundamental flaw. By linking rejection to some aspect of their core identity, people found it more difficult to move on from the experience. Some said they “put up walls” and became warier about new relationships. Others were afraid to disclose the rejection to a new partner, fearing that this person would change their opinion of them, thinking they had “baggage.” (This might explain why some people hide past rejections, treating them like a scar or stigma.)

We then wondered: what makes someone more likely to link a romantic rejection to some aspect of “who they really are”? After all, other respondents wrote that rejection was merely a part of life, that it was an important part of growing up and actually caused them to become better people.

It turns out that your beliefs about personality can play a big role in how you’ll respond to romantic rejection.

Past research has found that people hold divergent views about their personal characteristics, whether it’s their intelligence or shyness. Some people have a “fixed mindset,” believing that these qualities are unchangeable. In contrast, those who have a “growth mindset” believe that their personality is something that can evolve and develop throughout their lives.

These basic beliefs shape how people respond to failure. For example, when people believe that intelligence is fixed, they’ll feel worse about themselves – and are less likely to persist – after experiencing a setback.

We thought that beliefs about personality might determine whether people see rejection as a piece of evidence about who they really are – as a sign of whether they are a flawed and undesirable person.

In one study, we divided people into two groups: those who think personality is fixed, and those who think personality is malleable. Participants then read one of two stories. In one, we asked them to imagine being left, out of the blue, by a long-term partner. In the other, we asked them to imagine meeting someone at a party, feeling a spark and then later overhearing that person telling a friend that they would never be romantically interested in her or him.

We might expect that only a severe rejection from a serious relationship would have the power to make people question who they are. Instead, a pattern emerged. For people with a fixed view of personality, we found that even a rejection from a relative stranger could prompt them to wonder what this rejection unveiled about their core self. These people might worry that there was something so obviously undesirable about them that a person would reject them outright—without even getting to know them.

So what can we do to prevent people from linking rejection to the self in this negative way? One promising piece of evidence shows that changing someone’s beliefs about personality can shift his or her reaction to rejections.

In a final study, we created articles that described personality as something that can evolve throughout the course of a lifetime, rather than as something that’s predetermined. When we asked people with a fixed view of personality to read these articles, they became less likely to interpret rejections as an indication of a permanent, fatal deficiency.

By encouraging the belief that personality can change and develop over time, we may be able to help people exorcise the ghosts of their romantic pasts—and move on to satisfying relationships in the future.

She eats two raw eggs everyday. ,https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/only-one-person-alive-born-183900482.html,"There’s Only One Person Alive Born in the 1800s — And Her Diet Is Incredible The woman, who's 116, has a really bizarre secret.

As of Thursday, Emma Morano is the only person on Earth who was born in the 1800s. She credits her longevity to her very bizarre diet.

The 116-year-old Italian woman isn’t gluten-free, vegan, or Paleo. She’s not gulping green smoothies or snacking on superfoods. Morano told the Associated Press she eats two raw eggs a day. Yes, really.

Since developing anemia as a child, Morano has been on the raw egg kick. It was her doctor who suggested she should add the eggs to her diet when she was just a young girl.

“

Morano’s secret doesn’t mean we should all be slugging back egg yolks in the name of health. Even though instances of egg-related salmonella have reportedly decreased since 1998, eggs for human consumption are probably better off cooked, because hey — why risk it? Plus, one study found that egg protein is more digestible when cooked, yet another compelling reason we should fully cook our omelets.

Whether or not raw eggs are all they’re cracked up to be (had to), Morano’s old age isn’t out of the ordinary for Italy, w number of centenarians. In one village, there are roughly 300 people over 100 years old, NPR reported.

It's worm poop. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/these-mysterious-south-american-mounds-turn-out-be-giant-piles-of-worm-poop,"Scientists have long puzzled over what created strange mound formations in the tropical wetlands of South America, and a new study appears to have found the answer.

The mounds, which are called surales, are found throughout the Orinoco Llanos wetlands of Columbia and Venezuela, and according to research led by archaeologist and palaeoethnobotanist José Iriarte, these spectacular formations are actually massive conglomerations of worm poop.

Surales vary in size, with the largest mounds measuring up to 5 metres in diameter and up to 2 metres tall. To figure out how these gigantic lumps came to be, Iriarte, a researcher from the University of Exeter in the UK, and his team analysed the physical and chemical makeup of the mounds' soil.

The team found that up to one half of the total soil mass of the mounds is composed of earthworm casts – the muddy soil byproduct ejected from worm guts. It's not surprising that worms leave their casts behind – after all, everybody has to go sometimes – but how do their poop piles become so… comically epic?

According to the researchers, the surales form when large earthworms feed in shallow, flooded soils within the wetlands. These big guys leave their larger deposits behind, creating mini poop 'towers' that start sticking above the surface of the water. Kind of like when Saruman's tower becomes flooded in by the Ents… except with worm poop instead of an evil wizard.

After enough time, this casts tower begins to form into a mound, and the largest surales are formed when a couple of smaller mounds situated close enough fuse together.

Professor José Iriarte

Despite the surales' somewhat humble beginnings, now that we know how they come to be, it helps solve a riddle that has long perplexed researchers. Previous hypotheses on their formation included termite activity and a form of land erosion, but the new findings finally discount those explanations.

""This exciting discovery allows us to map and understand how these massive landscapes were formed,"" said Iriarte. ""The fact we know they were created by earthworms across the seasonally flooded savannahs of South America will certainly change how we think about human versus naturally-built landscapes in the region.""

You get an oscillating circuit. ,https://www.wired.com/2016/05/go-ahead-connect-inductor-capacitor-see-happens/,"What happens when you put an inductor and a capacitor in a circuit? Something kind of cool---and actually important.

What is an inductor?

You can make all sorts of different types of inductors, but the most common type is cylindrical coil of wire---a solenoid.

When current runs through the first loop, it creates a magnetic field that passes through the other loops. Magnetic fields don't really do anything unless the the magnitude changes. A changing magnetic field will create an electric field in the other loops. The direction of this electric field will make a change in electric potential that acts like a battery.

In the end, we have a device that has a potential difference that is proportional to the time rate of change of the current (since the current makes the magnetic field). This can be written as:

There are two things to point out in this equation. First, the L is the inductance. It only depends on the geometry of the solenoid (or whatever shape you have) and its value is measured in Henry's. Second, there is the negative sign. This means the change in potential across the inductor opposes the change in current.

How does an inductor behave in a circuit? If you have a constant current, then there is no change (DC current) and thus no potential difference across the inductor---it acts like it's not even there. If there is a high frequency current (AC circuit) then there will be a large potential difference across the inductor.

What is a capacitor?

Again, there are lots of different configurations for a capacitor. The simplest shape uses two parallel conducting plates with electric charge on each plate (but a net charge of zero).

The electric charge on these plates creates an electric field inside the capacitor. Since there is an electric field, there must also be a change in electric potential across the plates. The value of this potential difference depends on the amount of charge. The potential difference across the capacitor can be written as:

Here C is the value of the capacitance in units of Farads---it also only depends on the physical configuration of the device.

If there is a current going into the capacitor, the value of the charge on the plates will change. If there is a constant (or low frequency) current, this current will continue to add charge to plates to increase the electric potential so that over time, this potential will eventually act like an open circuit with the capacitor voltage equal to the battery voltage (or power supply). If you have a high frequency current, the charge will be both added and taken away from the plates in the capacitor with no charge build up and the capacitor will act like it's not even there.

What happens when you connect a capacitor and an inductor?

Suppose we start with a charged capacitor and hook it up to an inductor (no resistance in the circuit because I am using perfect physics-wires). Think about the instant right when these two are connected. Suppose there is a switch, then I can draw the following diagrams.","Go Ahead, Connect an Inductor and Capacitor and See What Happens"

Unless you're an amphibian or a superhero (Fish Woman, anybody?), the answer will be ""No."" The brain's innate drive for oxygen would override any ""willpower"" to win the prize.

Unnervingly, if you're currently living on a steady diet of sugar-enhanced foods, your brain is similarly re-wired, demanding that next ""hit."" Your willpower has as much of a chance at resistance as the ability to keep your body underwater.

We know sugar is not a healthy substance -- but it was this stunning example by my colleague Dr. Mark Hyman about its impact on our brain that really drove home the message. You see, I'm a reformed sugar addict. During residency, a long ER shift was the cue for a few bags of Skittles. A studying session led to Swedish Fish. But I realized that these sugar hits always led to a crash -- and then a craving for even more -- which made it clear to me that it was time to make a change.

Your Brain on Sugar

Advertisement

Sugar acts within the brain's ""Reward Center"" mechanism (it's like the brain's equivalent of the elementary school Gold Star chart, or if you're like me and in a home with a toddler right now, the ""Potty Chart""). Upon eating sugar, your brain releases Dopamine, our favorite ""feel good"" hormone, the same one that's triggered by other pleasure mechanisms like sex, exercise, and, on the bad side of the spectrum, drugs like cocaine or meth.

Through the same mechanisms as drug addiction, frequent sugar intake means that the brain eventually gets accustomed to that high and become less sensitive to sugar. So to get the same rush, your brain requires more and more sugar over time.

Here's how it works: You eat a sugary food, your blood sugar levels spike, and your body releases Dopamine (yay!) and insulin (which triggers your body to store the sugar as fat). Then comes the ""crash"": your sugar level plummets and you feel tired, hungry, and reach for the next sugary treat. It's purely chemistry, my dear, and these physical urges completely override your willpower and desire to eat healthfully.

Break the Sugar Cycle

So are you doomed to be a victim to brain chemistry? Hardly. Just as excess sugar rewired your brain in the first place, cutting back can reverse the dependence, just as I did. But this is harder than it sounds, largely because:

(1) It's everywhere: Added sugar is included -- sometimes as the second or third ingredient -- in over 70% of packaged foods. Think everything from breakfast cereals to BBQ sauce to salad dressings and so-called ""healthy snacks"" like granola bars or even those ""heart approved"" refined-carb breakfast cereals. The FDA just acknowledged the confusion behind these labels this week and is looking at redefining them, but until then, it's fair game for sugar-ladened snacks to boast the ""healthy"" designation.

(2) It's sneaky: Sugar exists in many forms, making it easy for the food industry to hide it in ingredient lists, listed with other names in foods you might not even think of as ""sugary.""

The Let's-Be-Realistic Bottom Line

Look, we all know the white stuff is going to sneak in somewhere, sometime, into our own and our kids' diets. You don't need to become a biochemist to cut back, and you can still even have a sugary treat once in a while. But if you're tired of this sugary chemistry experiment going on in your brain, follow these 3 steps to at least minimize the majority of added sugar.

Learn its disguises:

As tricky as this seems, sugar is almost never called just ""sugar"" on ingredient lists, so you have to be smart about spotting where it hides.

There are at least 61 different names for sugar on food labels. I may be a science nerd at times, but even I don't expect you to memorize them. Here are a few tricks: avoid anything ending in ""-ose"" like sucrose or maltrose. Look out for the buzzwords of ""syrup,"" ""nectar,"" ""cane"" and ""sweetener."" And be mindful that even natural sugars, like agave or honey, still contribute to your daily sugar limit. If sugar (or any of these terms) is in the top 5 ingredients, it's a treat, and not a nutritious food.

Cut Out Liquid Sugar:

Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages? News flash -- your brain doesn't even recognize these calories as food, leading to a high and crash that will end with you eating even more. Public enemy #1 is soda -- with up to 46 grams in a single 12-oz can, one drinks can put you over the sugar limit for the entire day (24 grams per day for women and 36 for men, per the AHA). Multiple studies have suggested the link between increased soda consumption and obesity in the U.S.

But it's not just soda -- watch the ""healthy juice"" too: many juices and seemingly healthy drinks contain added sugar. For the most part, unless you're talking a fresh-pressed, unsweetened juice, you're better off eating a whole piece of fruit. And to settle the whole fruit-is-sugar debate, while fruit does have sugar in the form of fructose, it's nothing in comparison to added sugars and doesn't cause the same blood-spiking mechanisms. There's no need to limit fruit if you're focusing on cutting back added sugar.

DIY It:

You don't have to completely cut out everything sweet; I don't like my coffee black or my yogurt plain. But it's a lot easier to control the amount of sugar you're adding if you do it yourself. Add a half-packet to coffee instead of letting the barista talk you into a fancy sweetened frappe. Buy plain Greek yogurt and add berries and honey; I guarantee it will have less sugar than the fruit-flavored, sugar-laden packaged kind. As it often does, it comes down to a simple truth: it's a lot easier to know what's going on in your body if you control what you put into it.

"It may reduce your capacity for empathy but pain may also reduce that as well.
",http://elitedaily.com/wellness/tylenol-side-effects-empathy/1491466/,"Zapping your headache by popping a few pills may also be killing your ability to feel.

In a new study published by The Ohio State University in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, researchers reveal, acetaminophen may reduce the ability to feel empathy for others.

Acetaminophen also happens to be the main ingredient in Tylenol.

To come to its conclusion, the team devised two double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments.

As the team describes,

...participants rated perceived pain, personal distress, and empathic concern in response to reading physical or social pain scenarios, witnessing ostracism in the lab, or visualizing another study participant receiving painful noise blasts.

The study came to its findings after having 40 college-aged participants take 1,000 mg of acetaminophen, while 40 more participants took a placebo.

The group then read eight different and unpleasant scenarios. In the end, the group that took the acetaminophen rated the scenarios as ""less severe"" than their placebo counterparts.

The team tested the results with a second set of 114 college students and came to similar findings.

How can this really translate into your everyday life?

Baldwin Way, senior author of the study, told Science Daily,

If you are having an argument with your spouse and you just took acetaminophen, this research suggests you might be less understanding of what you did to hurt your spouse's feelings.

The pure volume of acetaminophen taken in the US can also have profound effects on society as well. As the team concluded in its abstract,

Because empathy regulates prosocial and antisocial behavior, these drug-induced reductions in empathy raise concerns about the broader social side effects of acetaminophen, which is taken by almost a quarter of US adults each week.

However, simply not taking pain medication is a real lose-lose situation. Dominik Mischkowski, co-author of the study, pointed out to USA Today,

Pain might actually decrease empathy as well. So, there are other factors that need to be taken into account.

Liver disease. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-discovered-what-could-be-a-significant-new-health-risk-from-travelling-in-space,"If humanity is ever going to realise its ambitions of travelling to Mars and elsewhere in the Solar System, one of the challenges we're going to have to address is how to stay healthy in space over long periods of time. NASA estimates it's going to take at least 150 days for humans to get to Mars, and that's a long time to be exposed to things like cosmic radiation without the benefits of Earth's protective magnetic field.

Unfortunately, some of the latest research on the effects of spending time in space doesn't have very positive findings. A recent study found that mice flown aboard the space shuttle Atlantis returned to Earth with the early signs of liver disease – and the animals were only off the planet for less than a fortnight.

After 13.5 days onboard the shuttle during its final flight in 2011, the mice were studied by a team of scientists including anaesthesiologist and physicist Karen Jonscher from the University of Colorado. The team found that even a short duration of spaceflight appeared to activate specialised liver cells that can induce scarring and cause long-term liver damage.

""Prior to this study we really didn't have much information on the impact of spaceflight on the liver,"" said Jonscher. ""We knew that astronauts often returned with diabetes-like symptoms, but they usually resolved quickly.""

Unlike other studies that have analysed the effects of cosmic radiation on mouse brains to see how exposure to space could impact the animals' cognitive abilities, the researchers don't think radiation is what caused the liver damage in this case.

The more likely culprit is the relative lack of gravity in a microgravity environment, which scientists think has a negative influence on the animals' metabolisms.

""We saw the beginning of nascent liver damage in just 13.5 days,"" said Jonscher. ""The mice also lost lean muscle mass. We have seen this same phenomenon in humans on bedrest – muscles atrophy and proteins break down into amino acids. The question is, how does that affect your liver?""

When the space-faring mice were compared with a control group that stayed on Earth, samples taken from the travellers indicated increased fat storage in their livers, along with lower levels of retinol – an animal form of Vitamin A – and changes to the levels of genes that help break down fats.

Taken together, these are all signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and potential early indicators of fibrosis. The most disturbing aspect of the findings, which are reported in PLOS ONE, is the rapid timeframe in which these symptoms developed in the animals.

""It generally takes a long time, months to years, to induce fibrosis in mice, even when eating an unhealthy diet,"" said Jonscher. ""If a mouse is showing nascent signs of fibrosis without a change in diet after 13.5 days, what is happening to the humans?""

While NASA is aware of some of the risks that altered gravity fields can have on the human body – listing it first on a rundown of factors that could impact our health in space – liver damage isn't one of the risks reported, indicating we may still have a lot to learn in this area.

Of course, one of the primary scientific goals of NASA astronaut Scott Kelly's famous 'year in space' was the unique opportunity to see what such a long-haul trip off the planet did to the human body – with Kelly's twin brother, former astronaut Mark Kelly, serving as an Earth-based control.

The most remarkable and immediate (and temporary) effect seen was Scott Kelly growing an astonishing 5 centimetres (2 inches) taller over the course of the year, due to the reduced gravity environment onboard the International Space Station – but NASA's ongoing research into the pair and their health will be long-lasting.

In the meantime, scientists will need to do a lot more research to gauge the potential of liver damage from space travel, both in mice and humans. And aside from any technological measures we can implement to try to reduce or mitigate the health risks of space, the researchers also acknowledge the situation might not be quite as stark as these early results suggest.

""Whether or not this is a problem is an open question,"" said Jonscher. ""We need to look at mice involved in longer duration space flight to see if there are compensatory mechanisms that come into play that might protect them from serious damage.""",Scientists Are Uncovering a Terrible New Effect That Space Might Have on Our Bodies
Can I trust this person? Can I respect this person? ,http://www.businessinsider.com.au/harvard-psychologist-amy-cuddy-how-people-judge-you-2016-1,"Harvard social psychologist Amy Cuddy. Craig Barritt/Getty

People size you up in seconds, but what exactly are they evaluating?

Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy has been studying first impressions alongside fellow psychologists Susan Fiske and Peter Glick for more than 15 years, and has discovered patterns in these interactions.

In her new book “Presence,” Cuddy says people quickly answer two questions when they first meet you:

Can I trust this person?

Can I respect this person?

Psychologists refer to these dimensions as warmth and competence respectively, and ideally you want to be perceived as having both.

Interestingly, Cuddy says that most people, especially in a professional context, believe that competence is the more important factor. After all, they want to prove that they are smart and talented enough to handle your business.

But in fact warmth, or trustworthiness, is the most important factor in how people evaluate you. “From an evolutionary perspective,” Cuddy says, “it is more crucial to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.” It makes sense when you consider that in cavemen days it was more important to figure out if your fellow man was going to murder you and steal all your possessions than if he was competent enough to build a good fire.

Cuddy’s new book explores how to feel more confident. Amazon

While competence is highly valued, Cuddy says it is evaluated only after trust is established. And focusing too much on displaying your strength can backfire.

Cuddy says MBA interns are often so concerned about coming across as smart and competent that it can lead them to skip social events, not ask for help, and generally come off as unapproachable. These overachievers are in for a rude awakening when they don’t get the job offer because nobody got to know and trust them as people.

“If someone you’re trying to influence doesn’t trust you, you’re not going to get very far; in fact, you might even elicit suspicion because you come across as manipulative,” Cuddy says. “A warm, trustworthy person who is also strong elicits admiration, but only after you’ve established trust does your strength become a gift rather than a threat.”

"Sleep to ""Prune"" unused or ineffective synapses. ",http://www.fastcompany.com/3059634/your-most-productive-self/your-brain-has-a-delete-button-heres-how-to-use-it,"There’s an old saying in neuroscience: neurons that fire together wire together. This means the more you run a neuro-circuit in your brain, the stronger that circuit becomes. This is why, to quote another old saw, practice makes perfect. The more you practice piano, or speaking a language, or juggling, the stronger those circuits get.

The ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. For years this has been the focus for learning new things. But as it turns out, the ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. Even more important is our ability to break down the old ones. It’s called “synaptic pruning.” Here’s how it works. Your Brain’s Delete Button And How to Use It Your Brain Is Like A Garden Imagine your brain is a garden, except instead of growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables, you grow synaptic connections between neurons. These are the connections that neurotransmitters like dopamine, seratonin, and others travel across. “Glial cells” are the gardeners of your brain–they act to speed up signals between certain neurons. But other glial cells are the waste removers, pulling up weeds, killing pests, raking up dead leaves. Your brain’s pruning gardeners are called “microglial cells.” They prune your synaptic connections. The question is, how do they know which ones to prune?

advertisement

advertisement

Researchers are just starting to unravel this mystery, but what they do know is the synaptic connections that get used less get marked by a protein, C1q (as well as others). When the microglial cells detect that mark, they bond to the protein and destroy–or prune–the synapse. This is how your brain makes the physical space for you to build new and stronger connections so you can learn more. Why Sleep Matters Have you ever felt like your brain is full? Maybe when starting a new job, or deep in a project. You’re not sleeping enough, even though you’re constantly taking in new information. Well, in a way, your brain actually is full.

advertisement

When you learn lots of new things, your brain builds connections, but they’re inefficient, ad hoc connections. Your brain needs to prune a lot of those connections away and build more streamlined, efficient pathways. It does that when we sleep. Your brain cleans itself out when you sleep–your brain cells shrinking by up to 60% to create space for your glial gardeners to come in take away the waste and prune the synapses. Have you ever woken up from a good night’s rest and been able to think clearly and quickly? That’s because all the pruning and pathway-efficiency that took place overnight has left you with lots of room to take in and synthesize new information–in other words, to learn.

advertisement

Thinking with a sleep-deprived brain is like hacking your way through a dense jungle with a machete. Its overgrown, slow going, exhausting. This is the same reason naps are so beneficial to your cognitive abilities. A 10- or 20-minute nap gives your microglial gardeners the chance to come in, clear away some unused connections, and leave space to grow new ones. Thinking with a sleep-deprived brain is like hacking your way through a dense jungle with a machete. It’s overgrown, slow-going, exhausting. The paths overlap, and light can’t get through. Thinking on a well-rested brain is like wandering happily through Central Park; the paths are clear and connect to one another at distinct spots, the trees are in place, you can see far ahead of you. It’s invigorating. Be Mindful Of What You’re Mindful Of And in fact, you actually have some control over what your brain decides to delete while you sleep. It’s the synaptic connections you don’t use that get marked for recycling. The ones you do use are the ones that get watered and oxygenated. So be mindful of what you’re thinking about.

"The discovery of 1,284 confirmed exoplanets. ",https://bit.ly/1T9twP8,"As NASA readied to announce new information about the organization’s planet-hunting division, many of us wondered if we were going to hear the words, “We are not alone in this universe.” We did not. During a live audio conference, Kepler mission researchers announced the discovery of 1,284 confirmed exoplanets as part of a recent study—the most every announced at one time.

Since the Kepler Space telescope launched back in 2009, it’s mission has been to seek out possible habitable planets. If we are to become a space-faring species, we have to find Earth-like planets beyond our own solar system. Since its launch, Kepler has been watching 150,000 stars to find these possible habitable planets.

This star chart illustrates the patch of sky Kepler has been staring at for the past few years. It’s field of view occupies 100 square degrees of our galaxy.

The work of these scientists uses “astrophysical false positive probability calculations for every Kepler Object of Interest.” The 1,284 planets that have been validated as exoplanets through this method and no other. They determine, using these calculations, 1 percent of the 1,284 verified planets will be false-positives.

“Planet candidates can be thought of like bread crumbs,” said Timothy Morton, associate research scholar at Princeton University in New Jersey. “If you drop a few large crumbs on the floor, you can pick them up one by one. But, if you spill a whole bag of tiny crumbs, you’re going to need a broom. This statistical analysis is our broom.”

This method may help unlock Kepler’s full potential, cutting down the busy-work of examining anomalies that may not even be planets.

Kepler’s mission is to detect planets in that Goldilocks Zone. It examines the transit of planets across distant stars, which gives researchers an idea of the candidates ability to how life based on its orbit and size. While there’s so much more information to judge the “habitablility” of a planet, this is what Kepler is able to measure.

Future telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will be able to give researcher more information about distant planets. It will allow researchers to assess whether a planet is habitable or not based on atmospheric composition.

It’s nice to think that mapping out our galaxy may help us build a road map for future space-faring generations.

Stephen Petranek, a journalist and author of a new book titled How We’ll Live on Mars, agrees. He says we must become a space-faring society. Mars is the first step, a step that won’t be without its challenges, but a necessary one that will better prepare us.

The part of the brain associated with inhibition quiets down. ,http://www.sciencealert.com/something-weird-happens-to-your-brain-when-you-start-improvising,"The best musicians are somehow able to come up with a song or piece of music on the fly that no one has ever heard before. They just let the music flow, riffing off something that exists and creating something new.

That's what we call creative genius. But where does this improvisational ability come from? Charles Limb, a music-obsessed otolaryngologist and surgeon, wanted to know exactly that.

Over the past few years, he's put jazz musicans and rappers into MRI machines to see what's happening in their brain as they freestyle and improvise.

Results showed that when someone is creating something new, parts of the brain associated with self-expression (language and at times, especially while freestyle rapping, parts associated with visual imagery) are highly active.

At the same time, and perhaps more interestingly, another part of the brain associated with inhibition quiets down. At a TEDx talk in 2010, he said it looks like it does this ""so that you're not inhibited, so that you're willing to make mistakes, so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses"".

Below is a graphic from Limb's studies that shows that while improvising, areas of the brain involved in self-monitoring – the sort of thing that might stop creativity – quiet down (those are blue); while areas of the brain connected to expression and language become very active (in red).

TED

It's important to be cautious about research like this, as Limb notes, because we're just scratching the surface here. We know very little about how the brain works. Plus, images of what's happening in the brain – as fascinating as they are – are still a sort of observational science. We see something that's happening but don't know what's driving it and certainly can't manipulate it yet, flipping a creative switch.

But this is a start to understanding what creativity looks like.

To first look at what was happening as a jazz musician came up with something new, Limb had six musicians go through a set of steps. First he had them play scales, then improvise on them. Then they played a memoriSed piece of music, and finally an improvised version of that – all while inside an MRI scanner.

But they were up to the challenge. And all showed similar results while improvising – a dampening of parts of the brain associated with inhibition and an increase in activity associated with self expression.

Here's another graphic showing the way that brain activity changed. Blue is a decrease in activity, red is an increase:

TED

When Limb first published his research on the topic, co-author Allen Braun noted the similarities between the brains of improvisers and the brains of people in REM sleep – while they were dreaming.

""It's tantalising to think some connection exists between improvisation and dreaming, which are both spontaneous events. These musicians may in fact be in a waking dream,"" Braun told Hopkins Medicine.

Limb has followed this up with other research since then. He's shown that while improvising with partners, musicians' language centres in the brain are highly active, lending support to the idea that their music may actually be understood by the brain as a 'language' on its own.

More than anything else, it's fascinating to start to look at what creativity is on a neurological level. After all, the brain is perhaps the greatest unexplored frontier in understanding how people work.

We've mapped the human genome but are still trying to understand the massive network of neurons and glial cells beneath our skull. Concepts like creativity – the ability to make a mental leap and come up with something new – are even more mysterious.

""We know very little about how we are able to be creative,"" Limb says in the TED talk. But as he told Hopkins Medicine before, creativity is a fundamental part of humanity.

""Without this type of creativity, humans wouldn't have advanced as a species,"" says Limb. ""It's an integral part of who we are.""

Josh Allen set the tone for the Bills this past Sunday well before Buffalo’s offense took its first snap against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium.

In the morning leading up to the Week 16 AFC East showdown, Allen informed teammates that he woke up with “violence” on his mind. The star quarterback’s outlook, as wideout Isaiah McKenzie explained to NBC Sports’ Peter King after the game, resonated with the Bills.

“His point in saying he woke up with violence on his mind was we gotta come out and play every play like it’s the most important play,” McKenzie told King. “And we felt that from the first play of the game.”

Allen looked like a man possessed in Foxboro. The fourth-year pro had his way with New England’s defense, throwing for 314 yards with three touchdowns while also pacing Buffalo in rushing yards with 64. Allen’s stellar performance helped the Bills secure a 33-21 win, which vaulted Buffalo back into first place in the AFC East.

McKenzie certainly took Allen’s message to heart. The speedy slot wideout put together the game of his life, racking up 11 catches for 125 yards with a touchdown. McKenzie’s breakout game couldn’t have come at a better time for the Bills, who were without top WRs Cole Beasley and Gabriel Davis.

Players and coaches fall under the Tier 1 category, the NFL.com story noted, but the NFL Players’ Association would need to sign off on the NFL’s plan before players would get the booster shot.

But one player seems eager to get the booster shot: Chiefs wide receiver Josh Gordon.

One of the longest and most toxic rivalries in the NFL reignites for 2021 when the former takes their talents to FedEx Field on Sunday, and amid a fiery public exchange of words between the team's head coaches. Mike McCarthy expressed the ultimate ""confidence"" in his gameplan to go into Maryland and win, his comments meeting the ire of Ron Rivera, who labeled them a ""big mistake.""

That was far from the end of their exchange though, the media serving as a messenger service between Dallas and Greater Landover this week. On Friday, McCarthy was asked about Rivera's distaste for his initial comment, and he didn't pull any punches.

""The conversation we had in [Thursday's press conference], we were talking about a number of different things,"" said McCarthy. ""I think when you come out of a bye weekend, just like comments that are made, context is important. And I think sometimes that gets lost. But it's irrelevant what anybody thinks, anybody thinks about what I said in here yesterday. I was talking about my team.

""I can always coach my own team. And that's where I'm at with it.""

The temperature between the two rivals spiked further when owner Jerry Jones tagged in and jumped off of the top rope.

""That's outside the Dallas area -- outside the Texas area -- Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count.""

Despite there being a large element of fact in what Jones said, it sparked an even taller storm surge during what's labeled as ""Dallas week"" in the nation's capital, but it's what Jones did two days later that's truly turning the screws. The Hall of Fame owner flew in the Cowboys benches to have them placed on Dallas' sideline on Sunday, a first time for any opponent entering FedEx Field.

Let the games begin.

Now, it's entirely possible this wasn't merely intended to be a slight from Jones to a franchise that, if they had their way, wouldn't have allowed the Cowboys into the NFL in the first place (back in the late 1950s). Apparently, the Seattle Seahawks (who lost to Washington at FedEx Field in Week 12) tipped off Jones to issues with the hotseat benches on the visitor's sideline in the stadium, per Todd Archer of ESPN, detailing how they'd routinely go out during the game, so Jones decided to ship his own to prevent that from being an issue.

Temperatures are expected to be in the mid-40s at kickoff, per Weather.com, so Jones made the call.

The Cowboys are 8-4 after stumbling mightily in November and then handing the New Orleans Saints a loss at Caesars Superdome to begin the all-important month of December, but Rivera has Washington on a red-hot four-game win streak that puts them at 6-6 and back in the playoff hunt. Their battle on Sunday will be the first of the season and is not only critical for both clubs, but will also set the tone for their second matchup to come in two weeks from today. Rivera is hoping to upset the Cowboys and not only send a message to the NFL that his team could make waves going forward, but also as a means of shoving McCarthy's and Jones' foot into their respective mouths.

Of course, the latter two want nothing more than to do the same to Rivera, who has also reportedly held a meeting to advise his players to not fall for any perceived psychological tactics being deployed this week by the Cowboys, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network. It could be argued that Rivera having that conversation means they've already allowed the Cowboys into their mental space, but ultimately it'll come down to what happens on the field that decides this game, and the NFC East.

To that point, the Cowboys are seeing a surge of reinforcements return in Week 14 while Washington is forced to be without a slew of key players due to a combination of injury and COVID-19. If Rivera is going to stun Dallas, he's going to have to hope they're not on their best game -- i.e., overconfident -- and that his squad steps up to show McCarthy and Jones why words and flown-in benches don't matter.

As for the Cowboys, well, the benches can't be the only thing on their sideline that heats up on Sunday.",Cowboys make unexpected move before game with Washington; Ron Rivera warns his team to not fall for mind games
IND 41 - 15 BUF It's the 1070th unique final score in NFL history. ,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/colts-upset-win-over-bills-ends-with-final-score-thats-never-been-seen-before-in-nfl-history/,"For the second time in the 2021 NFL season, the Indianapolis Colts found themselves involved in an NFL rarity: A Scorigami.

If you're not familiar with Scorigami, it's pretty simple: The internet cheers when the NFL gives us a final score that's never been seen before and that's what the Colts' 41-15 upset win over the Bills gave us during Week 11.

Scorigami has grown so much on Twitter that the Colts even made note of the fact that they hit the unique score in the win.

The idea of tracking every Scorigami was created by SB Nation writer Jon Bois and there's now a Twitter account with more than 275,000 followers that tracks each and every Scorigami.

The Scorigami Twitter account should probably dedicate this week's Scorigami to Jonathan Taylor and that's because he scored five touchdowns in the win.

The Colts victory marked the NFL's fourth Scorigami of the season and the SECOND one by Indy. The Colts also had a Scorigami back in Week 9 when they beat the Jets 45-30. The first one of the year came back in Week 6 when the Rams beat the Giants 38-11. Arizona and Houston also had a Scorigami in Week 7 when the Cardinals beat the Texans 31-5.

In the Colts' win over the Bills, the Scorigami almost didn't happen. Going into the fourth quarter, the Colts were ahead 38-7 and if that had been the final score, that wouldn't have been a Scorigami because it's happened 45 times in NFL history.

Early in the fourth quarter, the score changed when Josh Allen hit Stefon Diggs for a touchdown. After the score, the Bills also hit on the two-point conversion to make it 38-15. Although that score is rare, it has happened five times before in NFL history, so that wouldn't have been a Scorigami, either. The Scorigami wasn't locked in until Michael Badgley hit a 35-yard field goal with over six minutes left to make it 41-15.

The Colts then picked off Mitchell Trubisky late in the game to seal the Scorigami. And that's how you get a unique score for the 1,070th time in NFL history.

This has been a surprisingly slow year for Scorigamis with only four. Last year, there were a total of 12 on the season. Of course, it's not surprising to see fewer Scorigamis and that's because every time one hits, that's one final-score option that's taken off the table.

Brady has made plenty of rivals since joining the NFL in 2000. The Miami Dolphins have always given him trouble, the Kansas City Chiefs were responsible for his torn ACL, and the Indianapolis Colts and Peyton Manning always provided must-see television.

Beating those teams was likely satisfying, but there's one team Brady enjoys beating even more. If you think about Brady's career for a few seconds, you can probably guess which one.

Yeah, it's the New York Giants.

Brady revealed that tidbit on his podcast ""Let’s Go! With Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald and Jim Gray.” Why the Giants? The Super Bowl losses, of course.

Here's Brady's answer, per NBC Sports.

“Holy cow, that’s a good question,"" Brady said. ""The team I would love to beat the most is the Giants, there’s no doubt about that, because they’ve taken away some really, you know — I’ve always joked with Eli [Manning] but, yeah, and I think he likes that I bring it up all the time. So to bring it up again, I do not like losing to those guys, so when we beat them I love that.""

The choice is understandable. Two of the biggest losses of Brady's career came against the Giants. The two times Brady played the team in the Super Bowl, he lost.

The regular season is a different story. Brady is 5-1 against the Giants. He's thrown eight touchdowns and four interceptions in those games.

Tom Brady praises Patriots after beating them in Week 4

Brady took things a step further and told Gray which team he enjoys beating the least. It's easy to assume Brady harbors bad blood against the Patriots, but that's not the case. He admitted he enjoyed beating his former team the least.

Brady explained it was tough to face off against former teammates.

""And the team I like to beat the least is obviously the Patriots. Again, those are my guys, man. Those are the other warriors that I went to battle with for so long. I’ve had a lot of battles over the years with different teams, there’s a lot of mutual respect in pro sports, but glad I’m through with the one last night.”

Sunday's win might have been bittersweet, but Brady can offset that feeling in a few weeks. The Buccaneers will take on the Giants in Week 11, and Brady won't feel any remorse if he's victorious in that one.",Tom Brady reveals the NFL team he loves beating the most and it's exactly who you think

Matthew Stafford knew where he wanted to go, and he ultimately took matters into his own hands to ensure his desires were fulfilled.

With his Detroit departure imminent, Stafford reportedly zeroed in on the Los Angeles Rams, the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers as his top three potential landing spots. And when a team not on that list became “aggressive” in their pursuit of the veteran quarterback, Stafford intervened.

According to NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport, Stafford nixed a trade to the Carolina Panthers that was gaining steam.

From Rapoport’s report Sunday:

After consulting with his family, he made clear that he wanted to go to the Rams and so did his family. Stafford made his voice heard, and the Lions brass listened.

Suddenly, the Panthers — despite offering a prime first-round pick and Teddy Bridgewater — were out.

""hey Alex, just want to let you know they'll fix you right up, you'll be good as new... I'm out here and I don't feel any pain from my injury three years later""
He felt bad because Smith's leg ended up needing 17 surgeries
",https://www.audacy.com/610sports/sports/ryan-fitzpatrick-on-regrettable-text-he-sent-to-alex-smith,"It's always the thought that counts in a nice gesture, and 99 percent of the time, performing said nice gesture leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. But there are also times when this isn't the case — like, for instance, finding out that a co-worker is taking the day off and telling them to enjoy it, only to find out that he/she is missing work for a funeral. Trust me... I know from experience.

And the same goes for Ryan Fitzpatrick, the longtime quarterback who's beloved by fans and players alike but had one innocent gesture that didn't quite turn out the way he had planned. He shared a story about a message he sent to Alex Smith on the ""Green Light with Chris Long"" podcast.

""He was picked No. 1, I was pick No. 250, but he was always really nice to me going through the (draft) process and I've always appreciated him over the years,"" Fitzpatrick said, referring to their 2005 NFL Draft class. ""When Alex broke his leg in that game a few years ago, I had a what I thought was similar injury. I fractured my tibia in 2014 with the Houston Texans and so the single-worst... text I've ever sent out, I sent to Alex.

""And I said, 'hey Alex, just want to let you know they'll fix you right up, you'll be good as new... I'm out here and I don't feel any pain from my injury three years later,' or whatever, whenever it was. And I sent it and felt good about it. And he said, 'Oh, mine might be a little more complicated.' And 17 surgeries later and the story of what he had to overcome, I mean, I felt like the biggest a------ ever.

""...But what he did last year was, it was incredible for him to get back on the field and I was very happy after sending that text that he didn't lose his leg.""

Smith's miraculous recovery story was one of the defining moments — perhaps the defining moment — of the 2020 NFL season, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it was easy for everyone to watch. In fact, it was quite the opposite, and Smith remembers just how poor the conditions were for such a return.

""I think the first [game] that he got put in was against the Rams and it was just images of Aaron Donald jumping on his back and him sitting there having to hold Aaron Donald on his back, and [he] got sacked a bunch that game, and it was pouring rain, and it just seemed like it was a miserable experience,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""I don't want to speak for Alex, but I'll say that I assume that it was such a huge personal challenge for him just to prove that he could do it, that he could come all the way back, and I think it was a really inspirational story for a lot of people watching him do that.""

Smith won Comeback Player of the Year, leading the Washington Football Team to a 5-1 record in his six starts and leading the league in passing yards (390) in just his first start of the season. The fact that he returned from an injury that threatened not only his leg but his whole life was a remarkable way for him to cap off an excellent career. After such an improbable feat, Smith decided to hang 'em up earlier this week.

How would Fitzpatrick sum up Smith's legacy outside of the injury?

""I think, you know, it's a goofy label and sometimes gets used too much, but I'm gonna use it for him,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""He was a winner. I mean, he won when he was in San Fran at the tail end there, when he was in Kansas City, and [it] wasn't always the 300-yard games and five touchdown passes and the way it kind of happens now with some of these young kids.

"Most consecutive stolen bases without getting caught to begin a career.
",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/diamondbacks-speedster-tim-locastro-sets-mlb-stolen-base-record-with-28th-swiped-bag/,"Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Tim Locastro stole his 28th career base in Saturday night's game against the Cincinnati Reds. With it, Locastro broke the Major League Baseball record for most successful stolen bases to start a career. Since making his MLB debut in 2017 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, he's gone 28 for 28 on his stolen base attempts. His mark of 28 stolen bases passes Hall of Famer Tim Raines, who stole 27 in a row from 1979-81. Records for successful stolen bases attempts have been kept since 1951.

Here's a look at stolen base No. 28:

Locastro, 28, will send his cleats that he wore for the record-breaker to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

""Obviously you always want to get into Cooperstown,"" Locastro told reporters after the game. ""That's what you dream about as a kid, winning the World Series and getting into Cooperstown. So, having my cleats there, that's unfathomable to me.""

The speedy Locastro -- who boasts an elite sprint speed of 30.9 feet per second -- grew up two hours from the Hall of Fame, in Auburn, New York. While Locastro's spikes will be featured in the Hall of Fame, he received second base as a keepsake for breaking the MLB record. The grounds crew at Chase Field retrieved it, and the base was authenticated.

Locastro gave his mom the base after the game:

Locastro's impact wasn't limited to the base paths in the D-Backs' 8-3 win over the Reds. He hit in the leadoff spot (for the third consecutive game) and finished with four singles, two runs scored and the record-breaking stolen base.

"Doctors found a blood clot in his lung and were able to treat it successfully.
",https://yhoo.it/2QbpT3y,"NCAA basketball official Bert Smith hasn't watched the moment that might have saved his life.

Smith abruptly collapsed during an Elite Eight game between No. 1 seed Gonzaga and No. 6 seed USC last month in the men's NCAA tournament. It was a scary moment as an audible thud was heard throughout Lucas Oil Stadium, and the official was taken off the court on a stretcher, though he was awake and alert.

Smith told the Indianapolis Star's Gregg Doyel he doesn't remember falling and hasn't seen a replay, but what doctors found that night could have been life-saving.

NCAA ref on stretcher photo

Smith, who became an NCAA Division I official in 1993, said he remembers the play preceding the fall. The action was moving away from his baseline position after a Gonzaga steal, but he said he couldn't move or catch his breath. He felt wobbly and the next thing he remembers seeing is the ceiling of the stadium.

Immediately after falling, Gonzaga assistant coach Tommy Lloyd ran to him and the bench waved for doctors. He was surrounded by medical professionals and eventually was helped on to a stretcher.

He's grumpy in the now-famous photo of him on it and told Doyel he was tricked.

“The doctor said, ‘Listen, tell you what, why don’t you just sit on the stretcher?’ I said OK, I can do that,” Smith says and now he’s laughing. To me, he offers an aside: “He’s taking advantage of a guy in a weakened position.”

He continues the story:

“The doc says, ‘Swing your legs around.’ I swing my legs around, and they go: Click-click-click-click. They strapped me in! I looked at him and said, ‘Oh no you didn’t …’”

He said he told the doctor at the time, ""You little SOB, you tricked me!”

Fall could have saved official's life

The NCAA announced later in the night that Smith was ""alert and stable"" and would not be transported to a hospital. Per the Star, he was treated at the stadium for two hours with vital checks on pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level that came back normal. He didn't have a headache or blurry vision.

Story continues

A few hours later, his officiating friends joined him at the hotel and suggested he go to the hospital to be evaluated for a concussion, just in case. At IU Health Methodist, the 56-year-old Smith was treated by Dr. Katie Trammel, ""an important part of this story.""

Via the Star:

“She sits down next to the bed,” Smith continues, “and she says: ‘I saw your fall tonight. Something doesn’t add up. I want to know why you fell.’ She checked a few things out, came back in and took me through the car wash. Just a lot of tests. And they found out.

“She said: ‘I got the answer to the question. You went down because you had a blood clot in your lung.’”

Smith’s pausing. Dr. Katie Trammel, he’s wanting me to know, may have saved his life.

“You don’t know where that clot was going next,” he says.

Smith was put on blood thinners and discharged two days later with the clot gone. No one knows where the clot came from, per the Star. He said the night before the game, while running the stairs in the hotel to see his buddies or get ice, he was a little out of breath. He gets exercise any time he can and officiates around 90 games a year for the NCAA.

It could have been a red flag, he said doctors told him, but then again ""sometimes it just hits you.""

Smith is back home in Kentucky with his wife, Jacquie, and his grandson, Karter. He said he'll be back officiating next season. He told the Star he's happy it happened during the Elite Eight when he could get the right help he needed rather than during an instance when he was driving or sleeping.

"The Patriot League hasn't played many non-conference games so they're a mathematical outlier.
",https://sports.yahoo.com/how-ncaa-rankings-have-tiny-colgate-ahead-of-a-handful-of-powerhouses-221121339.html?ncid=facebook_yahoosport_l0w2dc1068w,"The top seven teams in the NCAA’s NET rankings include unbeaten Gonzaga, one-loss Baylor and a trio of Big Ten heavyweights with national title aspirations.

Then there’s No. 8: A small-conference afterthought that has never won an NCAA tournament game in program history, nor even once appeared in the AP Top 25.

How is Colgate — the No. 2 seed in this week’s Patriot League tournament — ranked ahead of 2019 national champ Virginia, blue blood Kansas and powerhouses Ohio State and Villanova? Even the coach of the Raiders didn’t see this coming.

“It’s a mathematical outlier,” Matt Langel told Yahoo Sports. “It’s an interesting tidbit in what has been the craziest college basketball season in my lifetime.”

The explanation for Colgate’s top-10 NET ranking begins with the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the Patriot League’s schedule. The league did not allow six of its eight teams to start their seasons until Jan. 2. Only Army and Navy were exempt and had permission to schedule games in November and December.

As a result of that decision, the totality of the Patriot League’s non-league schedule this season consists of nine games involving either Army or Navy. Army went 4-1 including a narrow loss to Florida and an impressive win over mid-major power Buffalo. Navy went 3-1 including an upset of Georgetown.

In a normal year, the NET rankings — a metric created to help select and seed NCAA tournament hopefuls — would evaluate the strength of the Patriot League on the results of roughly 100 non-conference games. In this pandemic year, only nine data points are available. Army and Navy outperforming expectations in those nine games is dramatically warping the NET’s perception of the league as a whole.

“Basically, Colgate and the Patriot League are a closed system,” college basketball analytics expert Bart Torvik told Yahoo Sports. “You can't really use results from just this year with no priors of any kind and compare those teams against the rest of D-I because there’s no connectedness.”

Story continues

(Michael Wagstaffe/Yahoo Sports illustration)

Colgate has soared higher in the NET rankings than its Patriot League peers because of its 12-1 record and impressive margin of victory. Because the Patriot League broke its teams into three divisions to help limit travel, Colgate has only played three opponents: Army, Boston University and Holy Cross. The Raiders’ lone loss came by two against Army. They won the rest of their games by an average of nearly 19 points apiece.

“When you beat your opponents by such a huge margin, that shows up,” said data scientist Ed Feng, founder of The Power Rank.

While it’s theoretically possible that the Patriot League could produce a team worthy of a high ranking, recent history suggests it’s unlikely. Only twice in the 2000s has the Patriot League’s NCAA tournament entrant received better than a No. 13 seed. The league has not produced an NCAA tournament victory since 15th-seeded Lehigh toppled mighty Duke in 2012.

Other respected college basketball analytics experts have avoided overrating the Patriot League this season by incorporating data from previous years into their rankings. The assumption that the league would have performed at its recent average level in non-conference play makes a huge difference.

Colgate is 80th in Torvik’s tempo-free rankings. Ken Pomeroy has the Raiders 89th.

“The preseason weighting helps anchor the Patriot League in a more realistic way,” Pomeroy told Yahoo Sports. “The weighting only applies to cases where teams have played few games, so it influences the Patriot League while not being a factor for the vast majority of teams at this point.”

While the NCAA’s algorithm does not include data from previous seasons, Colgate’s top-10 NET ranking isn’t likely to dramatically alter the selection committee’s perception of the Raiders. NCAA spokesman David Worlock cautioned that the NET is “just one tool” and that “other metrics and criteria factor into the committee’s decision for selecting and seeding teams.”

Many mock NCAA tournament brackets project Colgate as a No. 13 or 14 seed if it wins this week’s Patriot League tournament. The Raiders received a No. 15 seed two years ago and lost a first-round matchup to Tennessee.

“I don’t think we’re going to get a seed that is similar to where our NET ranking is or even close,” Langel said, “but my hope is that maybe we can bump up a spot or two.”

The most tangible impact of Colgate’s high NET ranking is that Langel’s phone has rung more often than usual the past few weeks. Coaches of teams on the NCAA tournament bubble keep calling to try to hastily arrange a game.

Stoppages and outbreaks caused an unusual number of teams to scramble to fill holes in their schedules. What better way to do that than by scheduling the Raiders in hopes of earning a résumé-boosting Quadrant 1 victory without having to beat a traditional power?

“I fielded a number of calls from bubble teams as the season was winding down,” Langel said. “My angle was to try to get them to come here. I think a testament to our team is that nobody really had a lot of interest in doing that. They wanted to play us, but they wanted to play us in their venue.”

Colgate’s top-10 NET ranking has also garnered attention from coaches eager to assess how the Raiders did it. They all want to know if this is strictly a COVID anomaly or if there’s a lesson to be learned in how to game the NET in the future.

Among those qualified to answer that question is Matt Dover, co-owner of an analytics company that helps coaches optimize their non-league schedules to maximize their chances of making the NCAA tournament. It’s Dover’s belief that this is simply a “weird artifact of a weird season” — not a loophole to be exploited again and again.

“The NET is built to be pretty hard, if not impossible to game, under normal circumstances,” Dover told Yahoo Sports. “This is just a unique situation caused by the Patriot League playing so few non-conference games. That is leaving the entire league vulnerable to huge statistical swings that there won’t be in future years.”

Could another one-bid league gamble, only play a handful of strategically selected non-league games and hope to outperform expectations the way Army and Navy did this season? In theory, maybe. In reality, too many small-conference teams rely on the revenue generated by playing road non-conference games in return for tens of thousands of dollars.

“What are they going to do?” Dover said. “Totally forgo the option of playing those? Because that’s what you’d have to do. You’d have to limit it to a tiny, tiny sample size. Once you get up to a slightly larger sample size — every team playing a few non-conference games for example — it would be much less likely you’d get something super skewed.”

Kansas City Police told Yahoo Sports on Tuesday that the investigation into the incident is ongoing and there are no updates.

KCPD originally stated that similar cases take at least 1-2 months, as it awaits toxicology reports and further investigation. That timetable is still in play. Toxicology results alone in Jackson County, Missouri can sometimes take three months to be returned, according to locals with knowledge of the system.

According to a search warrant to draw blood from Reid, the 35-year-old acknowledged to officers on the scene that he had consumed 2-3 drinks prior to driving and was taking prescription Adderall. He was not arrested on the scene for suspicion of drunk driving or any charge.

The fact Reid was taken to an area hospital, where he underwent surgery for injuries sustained in the crash, may have played a part in that decision. While the lengthy delay in charges remains a topic of discussion, police and independent local defense attorneys say this is standard operating procedure, particularly for a high-profile case involving a critical injury.

Story continues

“While many point to alleged statements made by Mr. Reid to law enforcement as a reason to charge, this was a devastating incident with catastrophic consequences,” said Chris Scott of the Christopher Scott Law Office in Kansas City.

Scott does not represent Britt Reid, but both as a former county prosecutor and now a defense attorney, he has extensive background in DUI cases.

“Law enforcement needs as much information as possible before turning the investigation over to prosecutors for a charging decision,” Scott said. “It could be more than just toxicology results they are waiting for. There could be accident reconstruction taking place, other witnesses needing to be tracked down, or other issues they need to resolve.”

As for a timetable, no one can reasonably know. Police have asked for patience and continue to stress they are doing what they can.

“If toxicology reports are pending, those could come in tomorrow or take weeks or months to come back,” Scott said.

Then and only then will local prosecutors decide whether to pursue charges.

“Ultimately, he will only be arrested if criminal charges are filed,” Scott said.

In a statement last month following the crash, the Chiefs said they were “gathering information” themselves on the situation, but offered no details or update to Yahoo Sports this week. The team instead pointed to their previous statement.

What the Chiefs have found could have a significant impact on the case and the NFL itself. The accident occurred around 9 p.m. on the ramp leading from Stadium Drive to Interstate 435. That’s when Reid struck two vehicles, including one that carried Ariel. Her mother had driven to the spot to aid a cousin who had run out of gas.

It is the most direct route from the Chiefs' facility, where the coaching staff was working to prepare for the Super Bowl, toward Reid’s home in Overland Park, Kansas.

Due to NFL COVID-19 restrictions, Reid was prohibited from visiting any bars, restaurants or even a private residence. Doing so would have prevented not only him but anyone he contact-traced with from working the Super Bowl. Even then, there is no place to drink that would require taking Stadium Drive home.

As such, the suspicion is that Reid was drinking inside the Chiefs' facility, which like all NFL buildings has extensive video and professional surveillance and security.

Reid has a history of legal and substance abuse problems, including a prior DUI in Pennsylvania. The Chiefs overlooked that in the spirit of nepotism and gave Reid a job as their outside linebackers coach.

Reid was quickly suspended by the team following the crash. He did not travel to the Super Bowl, although since he was hospitalized that decision was moot. The team allowed his contract to expire a week after the season and he is not employed in the NFL. The Hunt family, which owns the Chiefs, has been in touch with the family of Ariel Young and is now offering support and resources.

Otherwise, it is still wait-and-see in Kansas City for a frustrated public.

There’s still hope for better days for Ariel, and for details and decisions from Kansas City law enforcement and the Chiefs themselves.

Feelings apparently are not mutual between Carson Wentz and his reported strongest suitor.

During an appearance Monday on FOX Sports 1’s “The Herd,” Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer identified the franchise most likely to acquire the veteran quarterback from the Philadelphia Eagles.

“I think Chicago is the frontrunner this morning, and I do know there’s a feeling inside that building from Ryan Pace, from the coaching staff, Matt Nagy, John DeFilippo (…) they believe, mechanically, they can fix him,” Breer said, as transcribed by NBC Sports Philadelphia.

So what’s the hold-up? Wentz seemingly has been available for trade for a few weeks now, and the Bears are in need of an upgrade under center.

Well, according to Breer, Wentz’s personal desires are serving as a hang-up in trade talks.

“I think the issue right now, Colin, is where Carson Wentz wants to go,” Breer said. “I think it’s become pretty clear he’d rather go to Indianapolis, and I think part of it now, for the Eagles, is, ‘Alright, if our best return now is Chicago over Indy, then we need to convince Carson Wentz, this is the only place you’re going, bud, and you need to buck up and accept this, and realize the Bears are going to give you a good chance.’

“I think it’s pretty clear at this point that the Bears have pushed harder than the Colts to get Carson Wentz. (…) I think the Bears would like to at least know that Carson Wentz is on board before pulling a trigger on a trade.”",Carson Wentz Rumors: This Team Is Frontrunner To Land Quarterback

"First time the two most recent Super Bowl winning QBs will face each other in the Super Bowl.
",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/why-tom-brady-patrick-mahomes-will-make-super-bowl-history-as-soon-as-they-take-their-first-snaps/,"Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes are used to making history. Brady, with a record six Super Bowl rings already in his possession, will go for a seventh when the Buccaneers face the Chiefs in Super Bowl LV on Feb. 7 on CBS. Brady's counterpart, Patrick Mahomes, made history last year by becoming the first player to win Super Bowl and league MVP honors before his 25th birthday. A win in Super Bowl LV would make Mahomes the youngest quarterback in history to win multiple Super Bowls.

As soon as they take their first snaps in Super Bowl LV, Brady and Mahomes will make even more NFL history. Brady and Mahomes will become the first winning quarterbacks from the previous two Super Bowls to face each other in the Super Bowl, as noted by NFL Network's Rich Eisen. Brady is two years removed from leading the Patriots to a 13-3 win over the Rams in Super Bowl LIII. Last February, Mahomes rallied the Chiefs to a come-from-behind win over the 49ers to claim Kansas City's first title in 50 years.

While the previous two Super Bowl winning quarterbacks have never faced each other in the Super Bowl, there have been six previous Super Bowls played between quarterbacks who had already won a Super Bowl. Here's a look at the quarterbacks who took part in those games.

Super Bowl Quarterbacks Result X Roger Staubach (DAL), Terry Bradshaw (PIT) Steelers 21, Cowboys 17 XIII Roger Staubach (DAL), Terry Bradshaw (PIT) Steelers 35, Cowboys 31 XVIII Jim Plunkett (LAR), Joe Theismann (WAS) Raiders 38, Washington 9 XLIII Ben Roethlisberger (PIT), Kurt Warner (ARI) Steelers 27, Cardinals 23 XLVI Tom Brady (NE), Eli Manning (NYG) Giants 21, Patriots 17 XLIX Tom Brady (NE), Russell Wilson (SEA) Patriots 28, Seahawks 24

In the previous six games between Super Bowl winning quarterbacks, a quarterback took home the MVP award on three occasions. In Super Bowl XIII, Bradshaw, the league's MVP that season, won his first of two consecutive Super Bowl MVP awards after throwing for 318 yards and four touchdowns in Pittsburgh's second Super Bowl win over Dallas. In the second half of Super Bowl XLVI, Eli Manning helped engineer three scoring drives to help the Giants win their second Super Bowl over the Patriots. In Super Bowl XLIX, Brady's two fourth quarter touchdown passes gave him his fourth Super Bowl ring and third Super Bowl MVP award.

Brady is 2-1 in the Super Bowl against quarterbacks that have already won a ring. His first Super Bowl win came at the expense of Kurt Warner, whose Rams fell to the Patriots in one of the greatest upsets in Super Bowl history. Sandwiched between that win and the Patriots' win over the Seahawks is New England's four-point loss to Eli Manning's Giants in Super Bowl XLVI. Four years earlier, Manning and the Giants had stunned Brady and the previously undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII, 17-14. Overall, Brady is 6-3 in the Super Bowl, and his six Super Bowl wins are two more than the second-winningest Super Bowl quarterbacks: Bradshaw and Joe Montana. His four Super Bowl MVP awards are one more than Montana, who went 4-0 in Super Bowls as the 49ers' quarterback.

The specter of facing the most experienced quarterback in Super Bowl history is not lost on Mahomes, who was asked about his soon-to-be Super Bowl counterpart following Kansas City's victory over Buffalo.

""Yeah I mean, the Super Bowl is the Super Bowl. Being able to go up against one of the greatest, if not the greatest quarterback of all time in his 150th Super Bowl,"" said Mahomes, who is 1-1 against Brady in his career. ""I mean it's going to be a great experience for me. To go out there and get to have a chance to repeat and get to do it against the best, I mean it's something special and I'm excited for the opportunity.""","Why Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes will make Super Bowl history as soon as they take their first snaps"
"Every time Tom Brady lost in Week 1, he made it to the Super Bowl.
",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-has-an-improbable-streak-going-that-he-can-keep-alive-with-a-playoff-win-over-the-packers/,"No team wants to lose during the first week of the regular season, but if Tom Brady is your quarterback, losing can actually be a good thing and that's because Brady currently has a pretty wild streak going that's tied to how his team does in the regular season opener.

Over the course of his 21-year career, Brady has made the Super Bowl in every season where he's lost in Week 1 and that streak will continue this year if Tampa Bay can beat the Packers in Sunday's NFC Championship. In his career, Brady has been the starting quarterback in 19 openers and in those games, he's gone 15-4 as the starter. The first three Week 1 losses resulted in Super Bowl appearances and now, he'll be hoping the fourth Week 1 loss does the same.

Back in Week 1, the Buccaneers lost to New Orleans 34-23, but then they rebounded to go 11-4 over their final 15 games before winning two playoff games to get where they are now.

Here's a look at what happened in the other three seasons where Brady lost in Week 1.

2003

Week 1: 31-0 loss to Buffalo.

The opening week of the 2003 season was arguably one of the most disastrous games of Brady's career in New England. In a road game at Buffalo, Brady completed just 14 of 28 passes for 123 yards while also throwing FOUR interceptions in a 31-0 loss. The blowout loss must have served as a wake-up call because the Patriots would go 14-1 over the rest of the season.

End result: Won Super Bowl XXXVIII. Despite the loss in the opener, Brady and the Patriots still bounced back to make it to the Super Bowl, where they faced the Carolina Panthers. In a 32-29 win over the Panthers, Brady took home the Super Bowl MVP award thanks to a performance that included 354 passing yards and three touchdowns.

2014

Week 1: 33-20 loss to Miami.

During Brady's career, the Patriots always had a tough time playing in Miami and the opening week of the 2014 season was no different. Although the Patriots led 20-10 at halftime, the Dolphins dominated the second half by outscoring New England 23-0.

End result: Won Super Bowl XLIX. The 2014 season marked the first time in 11 years that the Patriots had lost in Week 1, but like they did in 2003, they rebounded with a Super Bowl win. Although Brady threw for 328 yards and four touchdowns, this game is mostly remembered for the fact that the Seahawks didn't give the ball to Marshawn Lynch at the one-yard line on their final offensive play of the game.

2017

Week 1: 42-27 loss to Kansas City.

This is the only opening-week loss of Brady's career that came at home and it was an embarrassing one. In the Thursday night opener, the Patriots got outscored 21-0 in the fourth quarter. Brady got outplayed by Alex Smith, who threw for 368 yards and four touchdowns.

End result: Made it to Super Bowl LII: Like every opening week loss of Brady's career, this season also ended with a Super Bowl appearance. The only difference this time around is that the Patriots didn't actually win the Super Bowl. Despite an NFL-playoff record 505 yards from Brady, the Patriots were still beaten by the Eagles 41-33.

NFL's top-two rushing teams facing each other in the playoffs. ,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ravens-at-titans-playoff-game-will-feature-something-the-nfl-postseason-hasnt-seen-in-32-years/,"It's not often you see the NFL's top-two rushing teams face each other in the playoffs, but that's exactly what will be happening on Sunday in Nashville when Tennessee hosts Baltimore for a wild-card game.

In an era where nearly every team in the NFL loves to throw the ball, the Ravens and Titans have gone against the grain and their throwback strategy means we're going to be getting a postseason rarity: This week's game will mark the first time in nearly 32 years that the NFL's top-two rushing teams have faced each other in the playoffs.

The last time it happened came in January 1989 when the Bengals and 49ers met up in Super Bowl XXIII. In that game, the 49ers and their No. 2 rushing offense narrowly beat a Bengals team that ranked No. 1 overall in rushing in 1988. Although the Bengals had the NFL MVP on their team that year in Boomer Esiason, they still managed to average 169.4 yards per game on the ground. As for the 49ers, their ground attack averaged 157.6 yards per game even though they had Joe Montana under center.

Neither team came anywhere close to their season average as the 49ers totaled 111 rushing yards while the Bengals ended with 106 yards in San Francisco's 20-16 Super Bowl win.

The Ravens-Titans game will mark the just the fourth time that the top-two rushing teams have met in the postseason since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. Besides Super Bowl XXIII, there was also the 1972 AFC Championship that featured an undefeated Dolphins team (211.4 yards per game during the season) going up against the Steelers (180 yards per game). The other meeting came in the 1970 divisional round between the Cowboys (164.3) and Lions (151.9).

In the three previous meetings, the team that led the NFL in rushing yards has gone 2-1 with the Dolphins (21-17) and Cowboys (5-0) both winning. Also, that is not a typo, the Cowboys won a playoff game 5-0.

This year, Baltimore will be going into the postseason on the heels of winning the regular season rushing title. The Ravens averaged 191.9 yards per game on the ground this year, which led the NFL by more than 20 yards. The only team that even came close to matching them was the Titans, who finished second overall with an average of 168.1 yards per game (No other team in the NFL even averaged 150 yards). Not only did they rank one and two in rushing this year, they were also two of the three teams in the NFL that called more run plays than pass plays in 2020 (The Patriots were the other one).

Although they were the top-two teams in rushing yards, there was a stark difference in how they got there. The Titans are more a one-man show while the Ravens are more of a running back by committee. The Ravens had three players finish the year with more than 700 yards rushing, including Lamar Jackson, who ended the season with 1,005.

As for the Titans, Derrick Henry finished the season with 2,027 yards, which is the fifth-highest total in NFL history. Henry could continue to make history on Sunday: If he hits the 150-mark, he'll tie Terrell Davis for the most games in playoff history with at least 150 yards rushing.

The run game will be important to both teams, but it will probably be slightly more important to the Titans and that's because they went 2-3 this year in games where they got out-rushed by their opponent and 9-2 when they had more rushing yards. As for the Ravens, they went 3-2 when they got out-rushed and 8-3 when they had more yards on the ground than their opponent.

This game will mark the third time these two teams have faced each other over the past 12 months and not only did the Titans win both games, but they out-rushed the Ravens each time.",Ravens at Titans playoff game will feature something the NFL postseason hasn't seen in 32 years
"Mets and Blue Jays
",https://bit.ly/38OMLeT,"The Mets and Blue Jays have long been considered the front-runners to land Astros free agent George Springer, and now, according to at least one report, they are the final two teams competing for the high-priced center fielder.

The New York Daily News' Deesha Thosar cited a source Wednesday that says Springer is expected to pick between those two finalists in January.

SAD TIMES: Josh Reddick has woo'ed his last 'Woo' with the Astros

SNY baseball reporter Andy Martino confirms that the Mets and Blue Jays are ""seriously interested"" in Springer, but that the Mets aren't as close to a deal as some have reported. Martino says the five-year, $125 million contract for Springer that has been floated is off and that Springer is asking for ""well over $150 million.""

MLB Network's Jon Heyman says the Mets and Blue Jays are engaged in a ""spirited derby"" for Springer as they bid against each other. He also says a deal could take a while as neither team has come close to Springer's asking price, but the Mets should be considered the favorite.

The Mets always have made the most sense as a Springer landing spot with new owner Steve Cohen looking to make a splash by opening up his wallet. Springer also grew up in New Britain, Conn., which is just about 100 miles from the Mets' Citi Field. Springer's wife Charlise grew up in upstate New York, also just about an hour-and-a-half drive from the Mets' home.

This is Springer's first chance to cash in on the free agent market. Before the 2020 season was shortened and salaries were prorated, Springer signed a one-year contract with the Astros worth $21 million. In November, Springer rejected the Astros' one-year, $18.9 million qualifying offer, which was a formality as the Astros had to offer that in order to receive draft compensation if he signs elsewhere.

If Springer signs with the Mets, it will be the second straight offseason an Astros free agent was lured from Houston by big money in New York. Last year, Astros pitcher Gerrit Cole signed with the Yankees for nine years and $324 million, the fourth-largest deal in baseball history.

The 31-year-old Springer will always be one of the faces of the Astros first championship. He was the 2017 World Series MVP, tying a record with five home runs in the seven game series. He homered in each of the final four games of that series against the Dodgers, setting a record for most consecutive games with a home run in the World Series.

Springer, who was the Astros' first-round pick in 2011, ranks fifth on the franchise's all-time home run list with 174 in seven seasons. His .491 career slugging percentage is sixth-best in Astros history.",Astros free agent George Springer reportedly down to two teams

Team Canada captain Kirby Dach is out of the 2021 World Juniors after suffering a wrist injury in Wednesday’s pre-tournament game against Russia.

The Blackhawks talented prospect needs to head back to Chicago to undergo further examination by team doctors and a potential surgery for his gruesome injury.

We say gruesome because on Christmas morning, a picture of Dach’s dismantled wrist was revealed on social media, and it is simply not the Christmas present he was hoping for…

We warn you, this ain’t pretty…

The sad thing is that Dach appeared to get injured on a harmless bodycheck in the neutral zone in the third period of the preliminary game against Russia on Wednesday night.

Right after contact, the young captain pulled off his glove, skated off the ice and went directly to the locker-room area. He probably saw what you just did above…

Against the Chargers on Thursday night, the Raiders quarterback was thrust into action in the first quarter after starter Derek Carr suffered a groin injury that sidelined him for the rest of the game. Because the injury happened with three full quarters to play, that opened the door for Mariota to not only see significant playing time but earn a serious raise in the process.

This offseason, Mariota inked a two-year, $17.6 million contract to join Las Vegas and back up Carr. As Field Yates of ESPN points out, there's an incentive to Maritoa's contact that if he plays more than 60% of the snaps in any game in 2020, he earns a crisp $200K. That payday could have reached $325K had the Raiders won, but Justin Herbert's goal-line plunge in overtime booted any chance of that extra $125K landing in Mariota's pocket.

Don't feel too bad for him though as his base salary for 2021 has now increased by $625K thanks to playing in more than 60% of their offensive snaps in this matchup as well. That means, Mariota made around $825K for his efforts against Los Angeles. Not too shabby for a Thursday night out in Vegas.

Despite being on the losing end, Mariota was extremely impressive and nearly had the Raiders pulling out the win. The former No. 2 overall pick completed over 60% of his throws for 226 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He also rushed for a game-high 88 yards and added another score with his legs. While a lot may be made about this quick cash-grab against Los Angeles following Carr's injury, this performance could even lead to a bigger payout if some quarterback-needy team this offseason sees Mariota as a potential starter for them in 2021. At that point, it'd be safe to say he's on a heater.",Marcus Mariota earns bonus from Raiders by filling in for the injured Derek Carr; here's how much he made

MLB might’ve tipped their hand at the Cleveland baseball team’s new team name, via the U.S. Patent and Trademark office.

A New York Times report late Sunday revealed that the “Cleveland Indians” moniker would be no more. That was confirmed on Monday afternoon by team owner Paul Dolan, who said that the organization would part ways with the team name after 105 years following discussions with Native American groups. However, the change won’t take place until after the 2021 season at the earliest.

Some names that have been floated around are the Cleveland Spiders and the Rockers. However, the MLB might’ve tipped their hand on the team’s newest nickname. That name is the “Cleveland Citizens,” which appears to be registered by the league in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Citizens a potential name for the Cleveland baseball team

When looking at the name, the trademark was filed on Aug. 17, 2020. While the league appears to have filed the trademark, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will ultimately be the new name. Rather, it would be more of a move to prevent someone else from filling out an application at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, so the league won’t have to negotiate a deal.

Momentum for Cleveland changing their name arrived after the Washington Football Team distanced themselves from their former insensitive moniker back in July. The Football Team name was initially used as a placeholder, but team president Jason Wright told ESPN that it was in the running to become the permanent name.

On Opening Day for the 2020 season, the Cleveland baseball team wore their navy blue road jerseys which had the city name on the front to support the name change.

Creating a new name for a sports team does take time, because they have to file trademarks for the name and the logo. It’s a lengthy process, but Dolan confirmed that they’re heading in the right direction and moving on from their previous moniker.",Did MLB just hint at Cleveland’s new team name?
“I have no interest in coaching.” ,https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-east/new-york-jets/bill-cowher-jets-coaching-interest,"Bill Cowher was linked to the potential New York Jets head coaching opening earlier this week.

The Jets are expected to fire head coach Adam Gase following the season (or before it ends). New York has yet to win a game this season and is on track to get the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.

While it’s been a disappointing season for the Jets, the head coaching vacancy could be an attractive one.

New York has some young talent and is expected to add generational quarterback prospect Trevor Lawrence in the NFL Draft. The Jets could attract some big names to their soon-to-be-vacant coaching position.

Cowher, who led the Pittsburgh Steelers to a Super Bowl, was linked to the job this week. However, he’s made it clear that he won’t be returning to the sideline.

“I have no interest in coaching,” Cowher told ESPN.

Cowher added that he has no interest in coaching and won’t discuss any jobs.

“I have too much respect for the coaching profession to talk about a job that isn’t open,” he said. “From that perspective, any job that is open, I have no interest in coaching.”

January 15th ,https://info.hockeyfeed.com/nhl-news/new-projected-start-date-for-2021-season-revealed,"Friday is a good day. And this Friday is even better than that!



Earlier this morning, TSN Senior Hockey Reporter Frank Seravalli reported that the National Hockey League has shared draft schedules with the NHLPA on Thursday, including a 56-game season outline.

While Seravalli pointed out that the schedules were all based on a Jan. 1 start date, the two sides had discussed pushing that date back until later in the month.

And now his colleague insider Pierre LeBrun reveals that the plan is now to see the 2021 season get underway on Jan. 15, which could allow teams to get training camps going after the Christmas break.

A Jan. 15 start is now being discussed, source says, really no choice given that Jan 1 doesn’t seem realistic at this point. Economic issues still unresolved but both sides keep talking about other issues around season planning. As Frank says below, some positive vibes https://t.co/0uMf6FViG2 — Pierre LeBrun (@PierreVLeBrun) December 4, 2020

Elliotte Friedman also confirms the report on Friday morning.

Latest details as far as I know https://t.co/fZgeON6uEi — Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) December 4, 2020

For the past weeks, it sounded like the NHL was refusing to stray from its original goal of starting the season on Jan. 1, despite the fact that this projected date is just a month away and the format has yet to be determined. However, this new development sounds like a positive one despite the fact that the start date is getting pushed.

Now, we all know, many more details need to be ironed out. Players aren’t happy about too many things, especially that the NHL has reportedly asked for players to defer 20% of their salaries while escrow increases to 25%. And this despite the fact that both sides agreed to a new six-year collective bargaining agreement before the league’s return to play over the summer that accounted for the expected financial repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The union agreed to 10% salary deferrals with escrow capping at 20%. That money was agreed to be paid in three equal, interest-free instalments in October 2022, 2023, 2024.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman insisted Wednesday that the NHL is “not seeking to renegotiate” the six-year Collective Bargaining Agreement extension that was unanimously ratified by owners in July.

“We’re not actually having negotiations and we’re not seeking to renegotiate,” Bettman said. “We made a number of assumptions collectively over the summer, most of which are not applicable anymore.

Matthew Stafford. The quote came from an unnamed coach. ,https://www.knbr.com/2020/11/30/would-win-super-bowl-coach-believes-49ers-should-trade-for-veteran-quarterback/,"

For those hoping the 49ers move on from Jimmy Garoppolo this offseason, an intriguing possibility became more likely this week.

The Detroit Lions axed much maligned head coach Matt Patricia after another disappointing loss on Thanksgiving. With the Lions essentially bottoming out this season, a full rebuild is on the horizon, and now discussions are ongoing around the league regarding what the Lions should do with veteran quarterback Matt Stafford, who will be 33 before the 2021 season.

According to one NFL offensive coach, the 49ers should trade for him if he’s made available.

“They would win a Super Bowl,” an offensive coach said via Mike Sando of The Athletic. “Stafford would be in a real organization finally. He would bend to Shanahan and that offense because there is such a history of success with that system. And Stafford would know he’s not going to get hit in the head all the time like in Detroit.”

Imagining Stafford as the 49ers’ QB is all well and good, but acquiring him wouldn’t necessarily be all that easy. First off, Stafford has a cap hit of $34 million next season and nearly $28 million in 2022. That’s more than the $26.4 million and $27 million that Garoppolo is owed in the next two seasons, and would likely hinder the 49ers’ ability to re-sign a few of their many upcoming free agents that includes Trent Williams and nearly the entire secondary.

It all depends on what the Lions want in return and how much the 49ers value a quarterback nearing the end of his prime. Stafford’s arm talent is fairly undeniable, and he’s still putting up numbers (261.5 yards per game, 18 touchdowns to 8 picks, 92.7 rating) on a very questionable Lions team.

Sure the 49ers as currently constructed with Stafford could be Super Bowl hopefuls, but would what they lose in bringing on Stafford keep them in that conversation?",‘They would win a Super Bowl’: Coach believes 49ers should trade for veteran quarterback

The NBA has welcomed plenty of amazing point guards from the draft in recent years. While this year’s crop is not considered as deep as the previous ones, most pundits believe that LaMelo Ball has the brightest future at that position.

Duke Blue Devils legendary head coach Mike Krzyzewski, however, completely disagrees with the public consensus and made a case why his point guard Tre Jones is a much safer bet than the controversial Ball. Coach K appeared on NBA TV and gushed over what makes the 6-foot-2 guard a truly special talent for teams looking for a floor general.

“I’d take Tre in a heartbeat. I think he’s the best point guard in the draft. He’s another guy that can come in and play right away. If you want to run, there’s nobody better in passing ahead than him. When I first saw him when we recruited Tyus, I watched Tre play quarterback for a 7th-8th grade team. He was magical out there.

"Fewest rushing attempts in a game (5)

During the Buccaneers' 38-3 loss to the Saints, Tampa Bay somehow only managed five rushing attempts, which set the NFL record for fewest rushing attempts in a game.

To say Tampa Bay gave up on the run would definitely be an understatement, because it was worse than that. It was almost like the Bucs forgot the run existed. After calling two run plays in the first quarter, they would only call two for the rest of the game. The crazy thing is that Tampa Bay was on track to finish the game with just four rushing attempts, but it ended up reaching five because Blaine Gabbert's kneel down on the final play of the game counted as a rushing attempt.

Here's what the box score looked like for the Bucs at the end of the game:

Ronald Jones: Three carries for 9 yards.

Leonard Fournette: One carry for 0 yards.

Blaine Gabbert: One carry for -1 yard.

If you're scoring at home, that's five carries for 8 yards. Before Sunday, the NFL record for fewest carries in a game was six and that had actually been done four times. In a twist of fate, Tom Brady was also involved in one of those games.

Chicago Cardinals vs. Boston Redskins, Oct. 22, 1933: The Cardinals couldn't get anything going in this game as they totaled just six carries in a 10-0 loss to Boston. Final score: Boston 10-0 over Chicago.

New England Patriots vs. Pittsburgh Steelers Oct. 31, 2004: The Patriots had to abandon the run early in this game after falling behind 24-3 in the first half. Brady ended up throwing 43 passes in a game where the Patriots rushed just six times for five yards. The Patriots were 6-0 going into this game, but fell to 6-1 after losing to the Steelers. The Patriots' leading rusher was Kevin Faulk, who had five carries for 4 yards. Final score: Steelers 34-20 over Patriots.

Minnesota Vikings vs. Buffalo Bills, Sept. 23, 2018: This ended up being one of the biggest upsets in NFL history as the 16.5-point underdog Bills would shock the Vikings. In this game, Minnesota gave up on the run after Buffalo jumped out to a 27-0 lead in the first half. The Vikings' leading rusher in this game was Mike Boone, who carried the ball two times for 11 yards. As a team, the Vikings finished with six carries for 14 yards. Final score: Bills 27-6 over Vikings.

Like the Buccaneers, all four of these teams lost. As far as rushing attempts go, the magic number seems to be nine. If you don't hit that number, then you have no chance of winning in the NFL. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, there have been 20 games where a team had eight carries or less and those 20 teams have gone 0-20.

The Seahawks, Broncos and 49ers were fined an additional $250,000. The three fines added up to $1.05 million.

The fines came a week after Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive VP of football operations, sent a strongly worded memo to all 32 teams reminding them of the importance of wearing face covering during games. The memo also stated that future discipline could be enforced to coaches who don't comply with the league's rules. This season, any non-player in the ""bench area,"" which is defined as each sideline between the 30-yard lines, is required to wear a mask at all times.

""We must remain vigilant and disciplined in following the processes and protocols put in place by not only the league, union and clubs, but also by state and local governments,"" the memo read. ""Failure to adhere to this requirement will result in accountability measures being imposed against offending individuals and/or clubs ... Becoming careless or ignoring face covering and physical distancing requirements will put the 2020 season at risk.""

While he was not fined on Monday, Rams coach Sean McVay said that he did hear from the league following his team's Week 1 win over the Cowboys. McVay told reporters that he figured that the league's memo ""was directed at me.""

""I've got to do a better job about that,"" McVay said with regard to wearing a mask during games. ""So moving forward there will be a conscious effort to do that.""

Knox’s plea may have been a bit premature at the time. However, with star running back Saquon Barkley likely done for the season with a torn ACL, his vision may soon come to fruition.

NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport has reported that the Giants plan to bring in the ex-Atlanta Falcons starting running back Devonta Freeman for a workout. Freeman, who spent the weekend visiting an NFC East foe in the Philadelphia Eagles, “should be” visiting with Big Blue on Monday.

Freeman Still Offers Upside as a Dual-Threat Weapon

Freeman has endured a notable whirlwind offseason, which included rejecting a deal from the Seattle Seahawks earlier this spring. Since then, he reportedly threatened retirement and switched agents. He’s receiving a few bites but has left every visit without a contract, this after his new agent Drew Rosenhaus vowed to find Freeman employment by “late July.”

Despite the NFL’s reluctance to commit to Freeman, he’s still just 28-years-old and a viable enough talent to help an NFL roster. While he may no longer be the player who tied David Johnson for the lead-league in total touchdowns by a running back in 2015, Freeman’s multi-faceted skillset makes him a feasible placeholder for Barkley until 2021.

The former second-team All-Pro saw a downtick in his rushing prowess this past season, averaging just 3.6 yards per carry on the ground over his 14 games. With that said, he had averaged a far superior 4.53 ypc. over the five seasons prior. Not to mention, Freeman still remains one of the league’s better receiving backs, hauling in 59 receptions in 2019, ranked eighth-most amongst players at his position.

The Giants don’t have a clear answer to losing Barkley, who went down early in the second quarter of Sunday’s loss to the Chicago Bears. But then again, no team would. Offseason addition Dion Lewis tried his best to shoulder the load in Barkley’s absence in Week 2, yet mustered up a mere 20-rushing yards on 10 carries.

Wayne Gallman, the only other running back on the Giants’ current roster, was a healthy scratch on Sunday. Expect Gallman to be tossed into action this coming week against a battered San Francisco 49ers team. Gallman has shown himself capable of producing as a go-to option in spot situations, most notably a 118-yard, two-touchdown performance back in Week 4 of last season.

Despite the duo of Lewis and Gallman, the Giants will be on the search for reinforcements in the backfield, a search which may just so happen to end with them adding a former two-time Pro Bowler into the fold.",Giants Eyeing Ex-NFL TD Leader as Saquon Barkley Replacement: Report

Earlier this week, the Patriots inked giant Central Connecticut product, Jake Dolegala to a contract and added him to the team’s practice squad.

The Patriots have signed former Bengals QB Jake Dolegala to their practice squad. Quality move for the St. Francis High grad. — Tim Graham (@ByTimGraham) September 15, 2020

Newton, who is 6-foot-5, is one of the bigger quarterbacks in the league, but Dolegala might make him look a bit little small.

Follow the Heavy on Patriots Facebook page for the latest breaking news, rumors, and content!

Where Is Dolegala From?

Dolegala played for four years at Central Connecticut. As a senior in 2018, he completed 61% of his passes, threw for 2,221 yards and 16 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions. He wasn’t drafted in 2019, but was a part of the Cincinnati Bengals’ camp this year and in 2019 where he performed well.

During the 2019 preseason, Dolegala completed 37-of-61 passes for 347 yards and 2 touchdowns. There was some thought he could be a developmental prospect in Cincinnati, but once the team drafted Joe Burrow No. 1 overall in 2020, it was clear Dolegala was expendable, even as an option to supply depth.

The Patriots must have had an eye on him last year and in 2020 because they brought him in to be a part of the practice squad.

What Role Is He Going to Play on the Practice Squad?

For now, Dolegala is just on the practice squad to provide some depth. He is the only quarterback on the practice squad with the team having released Brian Lewerke. If for no other reason, Dolegala gives the Patriots a young player who can learn their system and continue to give wide receiver prospects like Devin Ross and Isaiah Zuber some work.

Could He Be a Developmental Quarterback?

With his height, strong arm and solid decision-making, Dolegala has some potential. However, he’d need to really show himself to be quite the quick study for him to make a big enough of a mark with the team to justify any level of security. To be honest, I’d be surprised if he was still a part of the team, in any capacity, by the end of the season.

Perhaps he’ll be a surprise and push Jarrett Stidham as the best young quarterback on the roster.

One could describe Bill Belichick in any number of ways.

He’s The Hoodie. The GOAT. A legend whose football acumen is renowned across the NFL.

But for some, a nickname given to Belichick early in his coaching career might perfectly encapsulate the New England Patriots’ head man.

Here’s an excerpt from “The Dynasty,” by Jeff Benedict, which The Athletic shared Wednesday in wake of the book’s publication:

One of Belichick’s nicknames was Doom. Bill Parcells had given it to him when Belichick was his defensive coordinator for the Giants. “We used to call him Doom because every time he walked around it was the end of the world,” ex-Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor said. “‘Ah, you didn’t make this play.’ ‘Ah, you didn’t go over here.’ It was the end of the world.”

The nickname fit Belichick’s dour demeanor, which fed into his tendency to focus on and prepare for scenarios that most coaches overlooked. “Looking at the negative side and preparing for the negative has made him a better football coach, because he prepares for all of the things that can go bad,” said Patriots defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel. “And to tell you the truth, I think he kind of halfway liked the idea that people were calling him Doom because that way, he didn’t have to be nice to anybody.”

Benedict’s book goes on to describe the situation that existed when Drew Bledsoe went down with a scary injury in 2001, paving the way for Tom Brady to become New England’s starting quarterback.",Is This Old Bill Belichick Nickname Perfect For Patriots Head Coach?

In fact, Newton taking his talents to New England was long in the making.

Considering Newton lingered on the open market for roughly three months before being signed by the Patriots, many believed Bill Belichick and Co. took a flier on the veteran quarterback after seemingly no other team was willing to. But according to NFL Network’s Michael Giardi, the Patriots had been keeping tabs on Newton since he was released by the Carolina Panthers in late March.

“It’s clear there was a ton of interest between the Patriots and Cam Newton,” Giardi said. “The moment Newton was released, there was a phone call made immediately and then both sides did their due diligence. As you heard Belichick say, they felt comfortable enough to sort of create this union and obviously Cam felt the same.”

Not only were the Patriots able to land Newton on a discount, they also added a highly motivated player who will be entering somewhat of a “make or break” season. So despite what the Colin Cowherds of the world might say, New England’s investment in Newton could prove to look genius.",NFL Rumors: Here’s When Patriots First Reached Out To Cam Newton

If you ask diehard New York Mets fans what their favorite moment was, they might bring up their 1969 and 1986 World Series championships. But deep down inside, Mets fans were ecstatic once team-killer and Atlanta Braves legend Chipper Jones finally retired from the MLB. Jones has fueled Mets fanatics dreams with nightmares, because he always found a way to play at his best in Queens, NY.

Even years after his retirement, Jones is still living rent free in the heads of the Mets. Do you need proof? Well, look no further than Jones having a cardboard cutout at Citi Field during the Braves’ regular season opener against the Mets.

Was Chipper responsible for this?

It’s unknown if Jones purchased the cardboard cutout to be seated front row at Citi Field. But whoever did it, we give you major props. This is an amazing troll job.

In Jones’ 19-year career, Jones always rose to the occasion once he went to battle against the Mets. Jones played 245 games against New York, and he managed to slash .309/.406/.543 while hitting 49 home runs and 159 RBI, per Baseball Reference.

Jones always loved playing the Mets on the road, specifically at the old Shea Stadium. He loved the old ballpark so much, that he named his son Shea, who just so happens to have a cardboard cutout at Citi Field alongside his old man!

Mets fans were looking forward to the start of the season, but now they’re getting mocked by the man they sarcastically called “Larry” every time he visited the Big Apple. Well, by a picture of Jones to be exact.",Chipper Jones continues to troll the New York Mets in season opener

According to The Athletic, Manning pulled in a total of $3.36 million, making him the only player on the NFLPA's royalty list who cracked the $3 million mark last year. At this point, Manning could probably just live off his royalties if he wanted to.

The royalty numbers come from the NFL Players Association and the earnings only take into account the sales of things that the NFLPA licenses, such as jerseys, video games, and trading cards. Manning likely made millions from his Nationwide commercials and Brady likely made millions doing endorsements for companies like Aston Martin and UGGs, but those aren't included in the total since those companies don't sell NFLPA licensed merchandise.

The earnings year ended on February 29, 2020, which means the royalty totals covered all of the 2019 season. Manning has managed to stay popular, despite the fact that he hasn't played in an NFL game since winning Super Bowl 50, which took place in February 2016. Mahomes, this year's Super Bowl winning quarterback, pulled in a total of $2.78 million in royalties, which ranked third behind Brady, who pulled in $2.99 million.

There's a good chance that Brady will top this list next year, and that's because his jersey has been flying off the racks since March when he signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Of the top 10 royalty earners, only six of them cracked the $2 million mark. Besides Manning, Brady and Mahomes, Dak Prescott ($2.56 million), Saquon Barkley ($2.34 million) and JuJu Smith-Schuster ($2.19 million) all pulled in more than $2 million in royalties.

According to data obtained by This Is Money, seven million European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) cards are due to expire this year. If caught out, tourists will have to pay more in medical bills than expected.

This further adds to the worries of UK citizens who fear Brexit could mean the loss of cheaper medical bills abroad.

When in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, EHIC cards enable the holder to receive emergency medical care at the same cost and standard as state-provided care in the country.

According to the NHS, this means cardholders receive treatment “at a reduced cost or, in many cases, for free.”

After submitting a freedom of information request to the NHS business services authority, This Is Money revealed that 7,196,592 EHIC cards are set to expire this year.

The number expiring this year is unprecedented and marks an increase of 66% when compared with 2015.

Last year 4,333,892 cards expired, whilst only 2,797,576 expired in 2014. However, data is only stored for two years and This Is Money warned: “This wasn’t reflective of the whole of that year”.

✕ Brussels welcomes appointment of May as British PM

The findings suggest that a large number of UK tourists are set to be caught out if they produce an expired EHIC card when in Europe. Failure to produce a valid card may result in expensive private medical treatment.

Reminders are not sent out to EHIC cardholders and it is the responsibility of the owner to renew his card.

All adults over the age of 16 require their own EHIC card to benefit from the reduced cost in medical expenses. An EHIC card is free but This Is Money warned: “several websites have been set up in the past few years selling EHIC cards for a fee.

“However, these sites are a scam and you… can apply for an EHIC card through the official EHIC website, by calling 0300 330 1350 or by printing an application on the NHS website.”",Tourists in Europe face unexpected medical bills post-Brexit with millions of EHICs due to expire

Now, 70 years later, high-tech imaging techniques have helped shine a light onto the dark – yet profoundly inspirational – story of what took place there.

An international team of archaeologists has uncovered a 35-meter (115-foot) long tunnel that Jewish prisoners secretly dug with spoons and their bare hands to escape a Nazi massacre site in Lithuania's Ponar forest, a site where 100,000 people had been killed.

Researchers from Israel, Lithuania, Canada, and the US used electrical resistivity tomography to avoid disturbing the bodies in the mass graves, an imaging technique commonly used in mineral and oil exploration that shows up changes in electrical properties underground. Their imaging showed that a tunnel started in a pit, used to imprison the captives, and led to an open space in the forest.

“To find a little glimmer of hope within the dark hole of Ponar is very important as humans. The tunnel shows that even when the time was so black, there was yearning for life within that,” Jon Seligman, an archaeologist with Israel’s antiquities authority who participated in the expedition, told Associated Press.",Archaeologists Just Discovered Something Extraordinary Underneath The Scene Of A Nazi Massacre

Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, campaigned in support of Brexit and told GQ’s political correspondent Rupert Myers to “suck it up” during a brief exchange on Twitter on Sunday evening.

Myers had written: “I can’t get over the fact that the winning side lied about a whole bunch of stuff and yet expect us to live cheerfully with the result.”

The MP replied: “I know you’re struggling to cope with representative democracy & the decision of 17m people to disagree with you but chin up.”

Mr Jackson’s comments were spotted and retweeted by author J.K.Rowling, who wrote: “Welcome to our post-referendum, anti-elitist, in-touch-with-the-people politicians.”

In response, Mr Jackson told Peterborough Today: “I could not care less what JK Rowling thinks. It’s got nothing to do with her.

“There’s a campaign to de-legitimise the result which is the largest number of people voting for anything in British electoral history.

He added: “The point is there’s £350 million that has to be allocated to the EU. It’s up to the Government now - it might spend it on the NHS, adult social care, school places. We will have that choice to make.”

"1) Acquisition of Irish citizenship through descent, 2) marriage, or 3) ""citizenship by investment"" (basically buying your citizenship). ",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-eu-referendum-how-can-i-keep-my-eu-passport-travel-a7100091.html,"A passport from a European Union country confers the right to live and work in any other EU nation, and soon UK citizens will lose that right. After the Leave vote, some speculated that they could renew their passport immediately and remain a citizen of the EU for the next 10 years. That option will not work. Even though the cover of a British passport reads ""European Union"" at the top, when the UK leaves Europe, it ceases to be an EU passport.

Accordingly, many people will decide it is rational to seek an alternative passport. But how difficult is it?

The easiest route for some will be to acquire Irish citizenship through descent - a process that is straightforward if you have the good fortune to have an Irish parent. It doesn't matter if they were born in the Republic or Northern Ireland; it's the island of Ireland that counts.

The government in Dublin says: “If either of your parents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, then you are automatically an Irish citizen, irrespective of your place of birth. If you were born outside Ireland to an Irish citizen who was himself or herself born outside Ireland, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen.”

✕ David Cameron resigns as PM

Even if neither of your parents is an Irish citizen, you can go back another generation: to citizenship through descent from Irish grandparents.

The Irish government says if one of your grandparents is an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, you can have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register - and, “If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration.”

This lineage can continue through the generations: if you are (or become) an Irish citizen, this status can be passed on “by each generation ensuring their registration in the Foreign Births Register before the birth of the next generation”.

This is likely to mean the return of inflation – a phenomenon with which many of us are unfamiliar because prices have been stable for so long, rising at no more than about 2 per cent a year. The effect may probably not be particularly noticeable in the first few months. At first price rises would be confined to imported goods – food and clothes being the most obvious – but inflation has a tendency to spread and to gain its own momentum AFP/Getty Images 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you Interest rates might rise The trouble with inflation is that the Bank of England has a legal obligation to keep it as close to 2 per cent a year as possible. If a fall in the pound threatens to push prices up faster than this, the Bank will raise interest rates. This acts against inflation in three ways. First, it makes the pound more attractive, because deposits in pounds will earn higher interest. Second, it reduces demand by putting up the cost of borrowing, and especially by taking larger mortgage payments out of the economy. Third, it makes it more expensive for businesses to borrow to expand output Getty 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you Did somebody say recession? Mr Carney, the Treasury and a range of international economists have warned about this. Many Leave voters appear not to have believed them, or to think that they are exaggerating small, long-term effects. But there is no doubt that the Leave vote is a negative shock to the economy. This is because it changes expectations about the economy’s future performance. Even though Britain is not actually be leaving the EU for at least two years, companies and investors will start to move money out of Britain, or to scale back plans for expansion, because they are less confident about what would happen after 2018 AFP/Getty Images 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you And we wouldn’t even get our money back All this will be happening while the Prime Minister, whoever he or she is, is negotiating the terms of our future access to the EU single market.

If your genes are geopolitically unhelpful, the next possible route to an EU passport is marriage. But don’t expect instant results. Each country makes its own rules on how long it takes to acquire citizenship, and they are generally designed to avoid marriages of convenience. For example, the spouse of a citizen of Malta can become a citizen of the island only after five years of wedded bliss.

The final option is open only to those with the right kind of bank balance: buying your way in to EU nationality, with a “citizenship by investment” scheme that many countries offer. According to KPMG, Cyprus is “the ‘jurisdiction of choice’ for many high net worth individuals and their families”.

A startling number of sexual assaults were committed by serial rapists. ,http://www.attn.com/stories/8902/researchers-tested-backlogged-rape-kits-revealed-startling-truth-about-sexual-assault,"On Monday, researchers from Case Western University released the results of an investigation into backlogged rape kits in Ohio's Cuyahoga County. Included in the results are some noteworthy findings about the behaviors of serial rapists and one time offenders.

The data, which was reported by the Cut, revealed that a startling number of sexual assaults were committed by serial rapists.

According to the Cut, the Case Western study is related to a larger effort to process a huge backlog of rape kits in the Cleveland area. Researchers were able to look at 248 high priority rape case files, and found noteworthy differences between serial rapists and one time offenders.

""About a quarter of the serial offenders in this sample had previously been arrested for sexual assault, and 60 percent would have a subsequent sexual-assault arrest. The majority of both serial and onetime sexual offenders had a history of a felony-level arrest, but serial offenders' histories were more extensive and violent. Serial rapists were also more likely to kidnap their victims, commit the assault outdoors, and threaten victims with a weapon.

Case Western researchers also wrote in a brief that ""it is very likely that a sexual offender has either previously sexually assaulted or will offend again in the future.""

As result, they recommend authorities alter their approach to investigating rape cases.

""Investigating each sexual assault as possibly being perpetrated by a serial offender has the potential to reduce the number of sexual assaults if the focus of the investigation is more on the offender than on a single incident. Serial offenders have traditionally been investigated according to the consistency of the assault or the MO (e.g., who they assault, where they assault, how they assault). For example, our findings seem to suggest that MOs (while definitely important to track for investigative purposes, especially when DNA is present) are not a consistently reliable link across assaults and thus a missed opportunity to solve unsolved sexual assaults and an opportunity to prevent future offending.""

We don't know exactly how many untested rape kits are out there.

""We cannot be sure of the total number of untested kits nationwide because most jurisdictions do not have systems for tracking or counting rape kits,"" End the Backlog reports. ""Additionally, there is no federal law mandating a nationwide movement toward tracking and testing rape kits, despite efforts by some members of Congress to pass such legislation. However a growing number of states, all across the country, are making real reforms to end the backlog.""

In late May, the Senate unanimously voted to pass a bill that would grant rights to victims of sexual assault.

""The Senate measure would generally require that victims be notified of the results of rape kit tests, including any DNA matches, as well as toxicology reports that could show whether they had been given a date-rape drug, for instance,"" the New York Times reported.

""The bill would also ensure that rape kits would be preserved without charge for 20 years or until the statute of limitations expires, whichever comes first,"" the Times added.

Still, it's important to acknowledge that only a small fraction of victims of sexual assault report incidents to law enforcement.

Sixty-eight percent of sexual assault victims do not report incidents to the police, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN).

Not right away -- California grew just fine in the year the tax hikes took effect -- and especially not in the medium term, as new economic data showed this week.

Now, correlation does not, as they say, equal causation, and two examples are but a small sample. But the divergent experiences of California and Kansas run counter to a popular view, particularly among conservative economists, that tax cuts tend to supercharge growth and tax increases chill it.

California's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth of the year. That was up from 3.1 percent growth for the Golden State in 2014, which was near the top of the national pack.

The Kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015. That's down from 1.2 percent in 2014, and below neighboring states such as Nebraska (2.1 percent) and Missouri (1.2 percent). Kansas ended the year with two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- a shrinking economy. By a common definition of the term, the state entered 2016 in recession.

Other effects of the Kansas tax cuts, which were meant to spur entrepreneurship, are well-documented.

Story continues below advertisement

While state officials anticipated that the reductions would create a shortfall in the state budget, tax revenues have been consistently below even those expectations. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service have signaled that they could reduce Kansas’s credit rating, indicating there is a chance the state cannot pay its bills.

The shortfalls have forced Gov. Sam Brownback (R) and lawmakers to make additional adjustments. The state canceled the initial reduction in sales taxes, then increased them again, while delaying additional scheduled reductions in the income tax.

On the whole, Brownback’s policies modestly increased taxes for the poor and working class, who pay more in sales taxes than income taxes, while reducing taxes drastically for the rich.

The poorest 20 percent of households -- those making less than $23,000 a year -- are paying about $200 more, on average, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington. For the middle class, the changes have been a wash, with less-affluent households paying somewhat more and more-affluent households giving up a little less.

Meanwhile, the wealthiest 1 percent of households, those making at least $493,000 a year, are saving an average of $25,000.

Kansas’s gross domestic product is still less than it was at the end of 2011, said Menzie Chinn, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has been following Kansas’s economy. Meanwhile, the economy in the rest of the country continues to expand.

“It’s remarkable,” Chinn said.

It is perhaps less remarkable -- or surprising -- that California has powered along. The recovery nationwide has favored massive metropolitan areas stocked with high-skilled workers, which is to say places such as Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco. The damage from California's deep housing crash has slowly healed in places such as the Central Valley.

Still, the noncoastal regions of California lag far behind Silicon Valley and Los Angeles in their job and growth recoveries. The state's median income remains below pre-recession levels after adjustment for inflation, although it still beats the national average.

Few, if any, economists would say today that the recovery has been sufficient for all Californians. But almost no one can say that raising taxes on the rich killed that recovery. Or that given a choice of the two states' economic performances over the past few years, you'd rather be Kansas.",The interesting thing that happened when Kansas cut taxes and California hiked them
Volunteers dressed as angels formed a human wall to separate the hateful Westboro Baptist Church from mourners at victims' funerals. ,http://www.bet.com/news/national/2016/06/19/anti-lgbt-protestors-at-funerals.html,"As many of the funerals for victims of the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando have begun, and the majority of the victims were LBGT men, it's no surprise that the notorious hate group, Westboro Baptist Church, made an appearance to protest by holding up their hateful signs and claiming that homosexuality is responsible for the evil in the world. But they weren't prepared for what they found when they arrived.

The protestors were blocked by volunteers who dressed up as angels, with huge white sheets held up from their shoulders to block the signs, and chants, from the Westboro Baptist Church protestors.

The ""Angel Action"" counter-protest can be traced back almost 30 years, to 1999, when WBC members picketed the funeral of Laramie, Wyoming gay teen, Matthew Shepard where friends of the murdered teen dressed up in similar outfits to block protestors at the murder trials of the two men responsible for his tragic death.

The angels at Saturday's funerals were members of the Orlando Shakespeare Theater, and their actions were met with hugs and tears from the grateful family and friends of those lost in the tragic shooting.

The chants of the WBC were also drowned out by the angelic volunteers singing ""Amazing Grace,"" in a beautiful and emotional sing of solidarity and support.",Anti-LGBT Protesters Find a Surprise Waiting for Them at Funerals of Orlando Victims

Even though the holiday is a joyous occasion, I felt tears in my eyes as I recited our sacred prayers.

I had not been to a bar in more than 20 years. And I had never been to a gay bar. Someone in the congregation told me about a bar called the Fireplace, so I announced that as our destination. Afterward, I found out it was predominantly frequented by gay African Americans.

Approximately a dozen of us, wearing our kippot, or yarmulkes, went down as soon as the holiday ended. Some of the members of our group are gay, but most are not. We did not know what to expect. As we gathered outside, we saw one large, drunk man talking loudly and wildly. I wondered whether we were in the right place. Then my mother, who was with me, went up to a man who was standing on the side of the building. She told him why we were there. He broke down in tears and told us his cousin was killed at Pulse. He embraced us and invited us into the Fireplace.

We didn’t know what to expect, but it turned out that we had so much in common. We met everyone in the bar. One of the patrons told me that his stepchildren were actually bar-mitzvahed in our congregation. Another one asked for my card so that his church could come and visit. The bartender shut off all of the music in the room, and the crowd became silent as we offered words of prayer and healing. My co-clergy Maharat Ruth Friedman shared a blessing related to the holiday of Shavuot, and she lit memorial candles on the bar ledge. Then everyone in the bar put their hands around each other’s shoulders, and we sang soulful tunes. After that, one of our congregants bought a round of beer for the whole bar.

Everyone in the bar embraced each other. It was powerful and moving and real and raw.

After that we moved to the outdoor makeshift memorial service at Dupont Circle. There, too, we did not know what to expect. But as we gathered around the circle, people kept coming up to us and embracing us. One man we met there told us that his daughter sometimes prays with us. Others were visiting from Los Angeles but joined in full voice, clearly knowing the Hebrew words to the song we were singing.

As we were singing, I looked over at some gay members of our congregation and saw tears flowing down their faces. I felt the reality that we are living in a time of enormous pain. But I also felt that the night was a tremendous learning experience for me. I learned that when a rabbi and members of an Orthodox synagogue walk into a gay African American bar, it is not the opening line of a joke but an opportunity to connect; it is an opportunity to break down barriers and come together as one; it is an opportunity to learn that if we are going to survive, we all need each other.

Not really. ,http://www.npr.org/2016/06/15/482113672/are-gop-women-warming-up-to-trump,"Are GOP Women Warming Up To Donald Trump?

Enlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR

It's no secret that Donald Trump has struggled to win over female voters. Polls show more than 60 percent of women have an unfavorable opinion of the presumptive Republican nominee.

But, as the campaign pivots to the general election, are Republican women reconsidering Trump? It's this group of largely white women Trump needs in November.

In the key battleground state of Ohio, there are plenty of women who adore Trump — and plenty of women who despise him. But many Republican women seem to be somewhere in the middle. They may not like Trump's tone, but they're willing to vote for him, or willing to be persuaded.

""He is a rough talker, but it's not a big deal. Everybody seems so thin-skinned,"" says Diana Forrester, a longtime Republican voter. ""He's raised some wonderful children, and that tells you a lot about a person.""

Outside of her suburban Columbus house, Forrester flies an American flag. Inside, she has pictures of her family — including her son, a National Guardsman who was killed four years ago in Afghanistan by a suicide bomber.

""I don't believe we can continue to go in the direction we're going. We've got to change our direction,"" Forrester explains over chicken sandwiches and fruit on a hot summer day at her house.

She's upset by President Obama's leadership and his desire to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay.

""Why are we arguing about bathrooms?"" she asks, referencing the debate around transgender bills. ""It makes no sense to me. It's like everyone's gone crazy. ... Our sons and daughters are being killed on foreign soil, and we're worrying about bathrooms?""

Forrester says the Orlando shooting proves, once again, that even on U.S. soil, Americans are not safe.

""You can't send a child to school and be certain they will come home safe. You can't go to a restaurant and be sure you won't be shot over your soup,"" she says.

National security is her main concern, and she thinks Trump is the best candidate to protect the country. But Ohio is a place where security moms meet Midwestern manners, and Trump's tactics and tone ruffle a lot of feathers.

""I don't know how he's going to mend fences with women in general,"" says state Rep. Barbara Sears, who described Trump's attitude as ""condescending and simplistic.""

Sears is a delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich at the Republican National Convention this summer. She was a loyal Kasich supporter, and campaigned for him across five different states when he was running for president.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR

But now that Kasich is out of the running, she plans to support Trump — it's a matter of pragmatism and party loyalty, she says.

""Philosophically I'm a Republican, lean more toward the conservative side, and so the idea of moving away from some semblance of a conservative side would just not be acceptable to me,"" she explains. ""So, yes, I'll support Donald Trump ... and rally behind that, because that's the philosophy I want guiding the ship down in D.C.""

But does she like Trump?

""I'm still trying to decide whether I like him or not, but I don't know whether I have to like the president. I have to respect the president's ability to lead the country, right? I don't have to be overly excited about the idea of having a cup of coffee with him,"" she says.

At a park in a wealthy suburb just outside Columbus, moms in sun hats watch their kids in bathing suits splash through water fountains. It's the kind of park where you see Muslim, Latino and black families — and Kasich-style Republicans, like Rachel Pugar, 29.

""We're not thrilled with Donald Trump,"" she says with a laugh, nodding to her husband, who stands nearby in a pair of scrubs watching their daughter.

Pugar says they supported Kasich in the primaries and worry that Trump doesn't understand foreign policy.

""I think he's a little bit dangerous,"" she says. ""I don't like the way he talks about women and minorities. ... He just doesn't seem like a very stable candidate.""

But come Election Day, she says, she will probably still vote for him ""because we dislike Hillary even more.""

NPR spoke to about two-dozen Republican women from Columbus to Cleveland for this story, and many of them said they would vote for Trump even if they don't like his tone or his character.

But a few women were adamant that Trump is a choice they cannot accept. So, they say, they simply will not vote for president this November; they insist they'll vote for down-ballot elections, but they'll leave the top of the ticket blank.

""He's just so liberal to me, so liberal,"" says Sandy Nowak, who voted for Ted Cruz in the primary.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR

Nowak worries that Trump is not a true conservative.

""I just feel like I can't, in good faith, go vote for him and then sit back with a good conscience,"" she says. ""I don't necessarily trust him as a person. ... I feel like if we get him, we're saying goodbye to the Republican Party as we've known it.

Her best friend, Tamara Frazier, seems a little more open to persuasion.

""I'm willing to sit back and listen and see what he does over the next few months,"" she says. ""I'm still expecting him to be Donald Trump. I'm sure he's going to say things that just make me go, 'Oh!' ""

Frazier says some days she's optimistic that Trump is heading in the right direction.

""A lot of times he's on late-night talk shows, and he's being very calm and reasonable, and I'm sitting there going, 'OK, it's possible he could have good manners,' "" she says.

But then, she says, she's reminded of the insults he's hurled at women, mainly because of an ad she's seen on TV that she can't get out of her mind; it's an anti-Trump ad made by a superPAC supporting Hillary Clinton, in which women wearing Trump T-shirts mouth Trump's own words regarding women.

""They're hitting everything from short women to Megyn Kelly. ... I'm not kidding, every time ... that crazy commercial comes on, it puts me in the worst mood toward him,"" she says.

The problem for Trump is that Democrats already have a built-in advantage with women. So, he can't afford to have a Republican woman like Frazier sitting on the sidelines.",Are GOP Women Warming Up To Donald Trump?

"Donald Trump and his companies have faced at least 3,500 lawsuits for not paying bills for goods or services, and not paying overtime or minimum wage to workers. ",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/6/9/1536703/-A-USA-Today-Investigation-That-Should-Surprise-Nobody,"USA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn’t pay his bills

""During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah's at Trump Plaza.

""The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder. ""Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. “That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company… which has been around since my grandfather,” he said.

""Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will ""protect your job."" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades – and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.

""At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.

""Trump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.

""In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens – filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work – since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.

""The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.""",A USA Today Investigation That Should Surprise Nobody
Germany. ,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/06/germany-made-so-much-clean-energy-it-had-to-pay-people-to-use-it/,"On a bright and blustery day last month, a surreal event took place in the world of German energy prices.

Sunny and windy weather lit up the country's solar and wind farms, causing a surge of clean energy that amounted to almost all of Germany’s 45.8 gigawatt daily demand. Topped up by the supply from traditional power plants, the sum of energy being produced that day was well in excess of the amount needed.

And that means that for a brief moment in time, energy prices were negative: consumers were effectively being paid to use energy.

The below chart shows Germany's power production and consumption on 8 May 2016: you can see the gigawatts peaking between 10am and 12am.

Germany isn’t the only country living the green dream: for four consecutive days last month, Portugal managed to run entirely on wind, solar and hydro power. It’s a bright point in a generally cheery picture for Portugal, with renewable sources now providing almost half its energy each year.

Sixteen countries have now hit 100% renewable electricity production, according to 2013 data from the Energy Information Administration. Costa Rica made headlines recently by running entirely on clean energy for 75 days of 2015. Iceland has achieved its target of becoming 100% renewable-powered, with Norway close behind on 98%, according to the data.",This country made so much clean energy it had to pay people to use it

But for the fields of psychology, sociology and economics, it has been a gold mine, too. The sudden change in fortunes has offered a rare glimpse into the subtle but important ways in which money can alter a child’s life. The dataset is so rich that researchers continue to study it to this day.

""It would be almost impossible to replicate this kind of longitudinal study,” said Randall Akee, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the impact of changes in household income. “Especially for a sample this large. This is the sort of circumstance you dream of as a researcher.""

Seizing the opportunity, Akee, along with a team of other researchers, recently revisited the data to analyze each child’s personality both in the years before the casino was built and in those after.

As part of the original study, the children and parents were asked a series of questions, designed to measure, among other things, a number of personality traits. The same questions were posed every other year, for a decade. Akee's goal was to observe any changes—positive or negative—resulting from the extra household income. Their findings, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research last month, are nothing short of remarkable.

""This was hugely important to the development of the children, to their wellbeing” said Akee. ""And the effect wasn’t small either—it was actually fairly large.""

Not only did the extra income appear to lower the instance of behavioral and emotional disorders among the children, but, perhaps even more important, it also boosted two key personality traits that tend to go hand in hand with long-term positive life outcomes.

The first is conscientiousness. People who lack it tend to lie, break rules and have trouble paying attention. The second is agreeableness, which leads to a comfort around people and aptness for teamwork. And both are strongly correlated with various forms of later life success and happiness.

Story continues below advertisement

The researchers also observed a slight uptick in neuroticism, which, they explained, is a good sign. Neuroticism is generally considered to be a positive trait so long as one does not have too much of it.

""We're talking about all sorts of good, positive, long-term things,"" said Emilia Simeonova, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies the economics of health, and one of the paper's co-authors. ""There are very powerful correlations between conscientiousness and agreeableness and the ability to hold a job, to maintain a steady relationship. The two allow for people to succeed socially and professionally.""

Remarkably, the change was the most pronounced in the children who were the most deficient. ""This actually reduces inequality with respect to personality traits,"" said Akee. ""On average, everyone is benefiting, but in particular it's helping the people who need it the most.""

Story continues below advertisement

Why exactly this happened with the children neither Akee nor any of his co-researchers can say with absolute certainty. Not even Jane Costello, a professor at Duke University who was part of the team that initiated the original study and co-authored the recent paper can say. But they have a few ideas, based on observable changes in the families after the casino was built and the extra money started to flow in.

They know, based on the interviews with parents, that the relationship between spouses tended to improve as a result. They also know that the relationship between the parents and their children tended to improve. And they know that parents tended to drink less alcohol.

""There is a lot of literature that shows in order to change outcomes among children you are best off treating the parents first,"" said Simeonova. ""And these are really clear changes in the parents.""

Story continues below advertisement

There's also the question of stress, which the extra money helps relieve—even if only a little. While the added income wasn't enough to allow parents to quit their jobs, it's a base level that helped with rent and food and other basic expenses. That, Akee said, is powerful enough itself.

""We know that the thing poor couples fight about the most is money,"" he said. ""Off the bat, this means a more harmonious family environment.""

And some of the families, given the boost, even moved to areas with slightly better census tracts in terms of both income and education. They were, in other words, able to expose their children to a different group of peers.

Story continues below advertisement

For the most part, scientists agree that the window for improvement in a child's cognitive abilities is short-lived. By the age of about 8, children have set themselves on a path, Akee said. What comes next happens, more or less, within the confines of the limits that were created in their early years.

One's personality, on the other hand, is malleable well into adolescence. What's more, the changes tend to be fairly permanent.

""All of the evidence points to the idea if they change in the teenage years, they will stay changed forever,"" said Akee. ""In this case, the kids will likely maintain a different level of conscientiousness and agreeableness for life.""

Experts have known about the power of intervention for some time. A lot of previous research has shown that educational interventions can have sizable impacts on personality traits and, in turn, life outcomes. But rarely, if ever before, have researchers been able to observe the impact of a change in income across such a large group.

The takeaway isn't that casinos are inherently benevolent institutions. But rather that money—even modest sums—can be a pretty powerful thing. And for reasons most would likely overlook.",The remarkable thing that happens to poor kids when you give their parents a little money

",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ozone-pollution-rules-delay_us_5759af44e4b0ced23ca7571c?section=politics,"The House passed a bill that would delay stricter ozone rules by a decade or so. Priyanka Parashar/Mint via Getty Images

The House passed a bill on Wednesday that would delay the Environmental Protection Agency’s new ozone regulations for perhaps another decade -- a move that could endanger the health of millions of Americans.

The EPA’s October 2015 regulations lowered the limit for ground-level ozone pollution -- otherwise known as smog, which forms when nitrogen oxide reacts with volatile organic compounds in the air. The rules had been in the works for seven years, and even the updated standard was not low enough to please a number of public health and environmental groups.

But business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argue that the new standard is too strict and will hurt industry. They scored a win with the House bill, sponsored by Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas), which would push back implementation of the rules by 10 years.

Olson said in a statement that the bill is simply a “common sense"" effort to provide “needed flexibility so that states and localities can adequately achieve new, lower standards with time for compliance.”

Business advocates are understandably pleased. “Manufacturers are encouraged to see House leaders pursue much-needed legislation to reduce the burdens and inflexibilities associated with the 2015 ozone standards,” said Ross Eisenberg, NAM's vice president of energy and resources policy, in a statement.

But environmental, science and health advocacy groups contend that such a delay would increase dangerous air pollution. On June 7, 116 organizations signed a letter warning that the bill ""could well result in communities being exposed to unhealthy levels of smog and soot and sulfur dioxide and even toxic lead pollution.""

The White House has made it clear that President Barack Obama would veto the bill if it passed the Senate, releasing a statement on Tuesday that said it “would jeopardize progress toward cleaner air and significantly delay health benefits worth billions of dollars for millions of Americans.”

Ozone pollution can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, including asthma attacks, wheezing and increased risk of stroke and early death, according to the American Lung Association. The dangers are considered even greater for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and people with pre-existing lung and heart conditions.","This Bill Would Make It Harder To Breathe.

Turner was convicted in March on three felony counts of sexual assault.

According to Turner's inmate details, which are available to the public, he will be released on Sept. 2, 2016.

County of Santa Clara

Public Information Officer Sgt. James Jensen, from the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office, said over the phone the date that appears on the site is indeed when the court has instructed officials to release Turner, although he could not say that the sentence has been formally shortened.

When asked if it's possible that the release date suggests Brock may be moved to another corrections facility, Jensen said, ""That would not be a possibility.""

""If it says he's getting released on that date — unless there's some special circumstance and he receives new criminal charges while in prison and were to be charged — that is the date of his release,"" said Jensen.

An unnamed representative from the same sheriff's office told TMZ that Turner is being held in ""protective custody"" away from any inmates who aren't also in protective custody, and will have an escort who will accompany him on prison grounds.

According to the representative, Turner was eligible to receive these protections by virtue of him serving time for sexual assault and ""those type of inmates are often targeted,"" wrote TMZ staff.

"""Brexit"" is the option for Britain to leave the European Union. Proponents cite the economy and immigration control. Opponents cite damage to trade and a potential recession. ",http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/09/news/economy/eu-referendum-brexit-what-would-happen/index.html,"Later this month, Britain may do what no country has done before and vote to leave the European Union.

Opinion polls suggest the public is split down the middle. The referendum on June 23 is too close to call.

Those in favor of walking out of the EU -- the Brexit option -- say European rules stifle U.K. business and leaving would boost the economy. They also say Britain would regain control of its borders and be able to limit immigration.

Those campaigning for the U.K. to stay -- including the government -- paint a much grimmer picture of life outside the EU. They say trade and investment would suffer, triggering a recession, killing jobs, slamming the pound and causing house prices to fall.

The referendum is the biggest decision Brits have faced in a generation. The last direct vote on the country's ties with Europe was in 1975.

A win for Brexit would shape the future of the U.K. and Europe for decades to come. The big problem is that nobody knows exactly how.

Government crisis?

Prime Minister David Cameron would face huge pressure to resign. He is campaigning for Britain to stay in the bloc, but his Conservative party (and government) is bitterly divided over the issue.

Fellow Conservative and former London mayor Boris Johnson leads the Brexit campaign and may be a candidate to succeed Cameron.

Whoever leads the government, he or she would eventually have to give formal notice to the other 27 EU countries of the U.K.'s intention to quit.

There is no deadline for that to happen, but once it does there is no turning back. The U.K. would then have two years to negotiate its divorce from the EU -- including the terms of trade with its 440 million remaining consumers.

They're worried about the impact on trade. By leaving, Britain would lose its automatic right to trade freely with the rest of the EU, which currently buys about 45% of British exports. The EU is an even bigger market for British services, such as banking and insurance.

On the other side, ""Brexiteers"" say the government could negotiate a new free trade agreement. But no country outside the EU has been able to secure that kind of privileged access to European markets without agreeing to pay into the EU budget or to accept free movement of citizens -- principles rejected by the Brexit campaign.

Investment and employment may also suffer. Many U.S. companies are heavily invested in Britain and use it as a gateway to the rest of Europe. So they may scale back in the U.K.

Other EU countries poured £496 billion ($708 billion) into Britain in 2014 -- almost half of all foreign investment. Those campaigning to remain in the EU say the flow of money could fall if the U.K. severs its links with the bloc. Many companies sell goods from their U.K. factories to other EU countries, and Brexit would make that harder.

A recent survey by professional services firm EY found that 72% of global companies see access to Europe as a key factor in deciding where to put their money. Nearly a third intended to either freeze or reduce their investment in the U.K. until the result of the referendum is known. Real estate investment has already been hit hard.

World leaders: Brexit is a 'serious risk to growth'

U.K. officials have said that up to 820,000 jobs could be lost if Britain leaves the EU. Several global companies have hinted they might shift jobs out of the U.K. The latest warning came from JPMorgan (JPM) last week.

Some Brexit campaigners have acknowledged that a vote to quit the EU could initially cost Britain jobs.

What happens to millions of migrants?

Migration is another hot topic. One of the core principles of the EU is the free movement of people, which gives citizens of any member state the right to live and work in any of the 28 countries in the union.

Those in favor of Brexit say leaving the bloc would allow the U.K. to decide which migrants to let in.

But an exit from the EU would raise questions about the status of roughly 3 million people from other EU states who currently live in the U.K. Campaigners say they would be allowed to stay, but future EU migrants would likely need a visa.

Brexit would also impact the roughly 1.2 million Brits living in other EU countries, as they could lose their right to travel around freely and access benefits such as healthcare.

Brexit: The big numbers you need to know

The domino effect?

A British vote to leave the EU could be the start of turbulent times for Europe. The EU is grappling with the world's worst refugee crisis in 70 years, and populist parties are gaining strength. The economy remains weak and unemployment high.

Support for the EU is falling sharply. A Pew Research Center study this week found that 47% of people in 10 member countries have an unfavorable opinion of the EU.

EU leaders are worried that if Britain decides to leave, other countries could follow. That could lead to a gradual unraveling of the EU, with huge consequences for the global economy, security and stability.

A more immediate threat is the risk that the United Kingdom could break apart. Leaders of the Scottish National Party have said they would seek a new referendum on Scotland's independence if Britain votes to leave the EU.

Scots are expected to vote in favor of keeping the U.K. in the EU.",EU referendum: What happens if Brexit wins?
"Underwater volcanoes create massive carbon dioxide buildups in the lake - when the giant ""bubble"" is burst by an earthquake or a storm, the gas kills neighboring life. ",http://www.ozy.com/flashback/exploding-killer-lakes/65346,"A giant cloud of carbon dioxide bubbled up from Lake Nyos in northwestern Cameroon near the border of Nigeria on August 21, 1986, flowing into the valley below. It stripped the air of oxygen, suffocating 1,746 villagers and 3,000 animals to death.

This may sound like a scary movie plot, but for the thousands affected, it was a very real nightmare. A hydrovolcanic eruption 400 years earlier created a crater in the lake, where massive amounts of carbon dioxide built up over the centuries. Volcanic rumblings continued miles below the surface, with gas seeping into the groundwater to create “CO 2 -charged soda springs” that bled into the lake, says Dr. George Kling, a biologist at the University of Michigan.

When that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke.

The problem with CO 2 is that it builds up, “like in a soda bottle,” Kling says. No one can see the pressure building as long as the cap — in this case, the weight of the water — stays put and forces the gas to dissolve or be submerged. But when that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke, with bubbles rising to the surface and a giant burst of CO 2 escaping into the atmosphere.

Triggering the pressure’s release can be as simple as heavy rain or an earthquake. In Nyos, some boulders and dirt were the likely culprits, and Kling says he found evidence of a “very large and recent landslide” when he visited after the disaster. Dr. Njilah Isaac Konfor, a disaster-management and groundwater expert at the University of Yaounde in Cameroon, says there were reports of a week of rain before the event.

Luckily, there are just three known lakes worldwide with these properties, and only two of these limnic eruptions have occurred in recorded history. The first was a much smaller explosion at Lake Monoun, also in Cameroon, that killed 37. It took place two years earlier, almost to the day, just 19 miles away from Lake Nyos. Volcanologists and engineers, Kling says, have been working to eliminate the CO 2 risk there ever since via six-inch pipes that pump out the gas.

While “unlikely,” according to Dr. Greg Tanyileke of the Cameroonian Institute for Geological and Mining Research and the chief government scientist working on the lake, Lake Nyos could suffer another deadly eruption. Warding off such a calamity is an ongoing process, he says. Kling adds that, despite efforts to warn locals and help them make “informed choices,” many have returned to their homes and farmland because the soil there is so fertile, and farming is critical to their rural existence.

But CO 2 isn’t the only problem. There’s also a rickety natural dam made of volcanic ash and rock at one part of the crater. If it collapses, the top 130 feet of the lake could come crashing down, causing a flood that “would reach Nigeria” and endanger 5,000 people, Kling says. Even worse, this could cause another imbalance in the lake and possibly unleash any remaining carbon dioxide still suppressed at the bottom. This “double-whammy threat,” as Kling calls it, is being addressed by an expensive but essential dam-strengthening project that is nearing completion.



Even if Cameroon’s lakes are no longer a threat, scientists have their eyes on a far bigger lake in Central Africa with similar attributes. Lake Kivu, which lies on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, is 1,600 times larger than Nyos and contains 1,000 times more gas. It also sits on the Albertine Rift, where it is enduring increasing volcanic activity. This, combined with the fact that it has gas levels high enough to kill two million people along its shores if there’s a limnic eruption, makes it what Kling calls the “largest ticking time bomb in the world.”

And scientists haven’t settled on what can be done to avert the danger. The lake is so big that the methods used to degas Cameroon’s bodies of water simply won’t work. Instead, the Rwandan government is trying to prevent a disaster and capitalize on the natural gas — the fifth largest methane deposit in the world — by carefully harvesting the deposits for electricity. But until this project is done on a larger scale, another disaster like the one at Nyos remains possible.",Exploding Killer Lakes
"About $420,000. ",http://hellogiggles.com/chewbacca-mom-has-lots-o-money/,"Here's how much money Chewbacca Mom has made since her video went viral

One day, Candace Payne was just a regular cool mom, sitting in her car after a shopping trip to Kohl’s, and decided to try out the talking Chewbacca mask she had just bought. The next day, she was the biggest star on the internet.

Literally overnight, her simple Chewbacca mask video went completely viral, and now it is the most-watched live video on Facebook ever. Since then, she’s joined James Corden on his way to work; appeared on Good Morning America; and even took a trip to Disney World. These spoils are the same equivalent of what Luke Skywalker got after he blew up Death Star.

We can’t exactly put a price on that cool medal Leia hangs around Luke’s neck, but we can put a price on everything that Payne, a mother of two Star Wars loving kids, has received over the last week. Money went ahead and tallied up the actual $$$ that Payne has received since her video hit the internet…and it’s a lot. It’s almost enough to buy her own Death Star.

According to Money, the grand total is roughly $420,000.

Money breaks down the amount like this: $3,000 in gift cards from Kohl’s +$5,000 travel expenses for talk shows + $2,500 gift card from Hasbro + $7,500 Disney World vacation for the family + $2,000 for the VIP treatment at Fan Expo Dallas + $400,000 in college scholarships for her family.

That’s a whole lot of money. It’s just under half a million dollars, and it all came out of posting a 4-minute video where she laughs in her car over a CHEWBACCA MASK. Clearly, this wookiee is winning.",Here's how much money Chewbacca Mom has made since her video went viral
Women's shelters in El Salvador. ,https://www.buzzfeed.com/karlazabludovsky/this-is-where-women-are-seeking-peace-in-the-worlds-most-vio?utm_term=.paEjzVymQ#.etpGyq36j,"When Idalia, 37, decided she would defy his orders, her husband hired a hitman to kill her. Luckily for her, the assassin was himself thrown in jail before he could carry out the hit. Desperate to find out what was going on, Idalia went to visit her would-be killer in prison and found out how much her husband had paid to get rid of her. “$10,000. That’s it,” she said in disbelief, crying quietly.

In El Salvador, where warring gangs have unleashed an unprecedented bloodbath, turning it into the country with the highest murder rate in the world, women’s lives are almost worthless. “Men continue thinking they own women,” said Alba Evelyn Cortez, a consultant on gender issues at El Salvador’s legislative assembly.

It is, frankly, terrifying to be a woman in El Salvador. The staunchly Catholic country of six million on the Pacific coast of the Central American isthmus is one of the most machista and patriarchal in the region.

Systematically beaten, raped, and killed in a country that has rarely held their aggressors accountable, women have become even more vulnerable since a government-brokered truce between the country’s two main gangs collapsed in 2014, experts and activists say. In 2012, when the truce was signed, homicides dropped by 60% from the previous year, but last year they shot up past pre-truce levels: There were 6,653 homicides — an average of 18 per week, or 115 for every 100,000 people.

This violence has spilled from the street into people's homes. “Gang members are at the center of families,” said Silvia Juárez, of the Organization of Salvadoran Women for Peace, or ORMUSA, a nonprofit. “The violence that women in El Salvador face is more lethal now.”

Femicides, or the killing of women because of their gender, have been on the rise in recent years. In 2014, there were 183 cases of femicide, up from 98 the previous year, though the numbers are believed to be significantly underreported. But it’s not just femicides: The rate at which women are being killed is rising faster than men. Last year, women made up 8.6% of all homicides, up from 7.5% the previous year, according to the Institute of Legal Medicine.

Despite this, there are few resources available for women who suffer domestic violence. The Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women, a government agency, has just one overnight shelter for victims of domestic violence, making it impossible for most women to reach.

In recent years, however, a glimmer of hope has emerged in the figure of the former first lady, Vanda Pignato. She has led a campaign to bring women's rights into the mainstream, and has built six centers — known as Ciudad Mujer (or Women's City) — around the country, offering women a place where they can seek help. And most importantly, they can do so anonymously — essential in a country where speaking out against your male abusers can be fatal.",This Is Where Women Are Seeking Peace In The World's Deadliest Country
Oregano. ,http://grist.org/food/this-herb-could-be-the-secret-to-curbing-cows-climate-changing-burps/,"Oregano may seem like an unlikely ingredient in the fight against climate change. But this modest herb could make cows’ methane-heavy belches — a big contributor to the warming of our planet — a little less potent.

Oregano’s essential oil contains carvacrol, an antimicrobial that kills off some of the methane-producing bacteria in the cow’s rumen. Danish researchers who are investigating oregano’s methane-suppressing abilities hope that it could reduce cows’ methane emissions by a quarter. Nearly 15 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to livestock, and 65 percent of that total comes from raising beef and dairy cattle.

NPR points out that oregano oil isn’t the only solution to cutting down cows’ ballooning emissions. Scientists have explored unpronounceable alternatives like 3-nitrooxypopanal, a methane-inhibiting chemical. But those may not be compatible with organic guidelines, and many of the people who care about cows’ methane emissions are the same ones who buy organic milk.

We could just eat less dairy and beef. But while some Americans are starting to shift away from meat, that change may not happen soon enough. It might behoove us to get our cows chewing oregano cud, since that could be one small solution we could implement fast.",This herb could be the secret to curbing cows’ climate-changing burps

For more than 15 years, Savage's doctors doled out the same advice: You need to stop gaining weight. When Savage replied that she had tried watching her diet and exercising, only to pack on more pounds, it was clear they simply didn't believe her. Her family was equally skeptical.

""I would eat like my sister, and I would gain weight but she wouldn't,"" recalled Savage, a civil engineer who lives in Montgomery County and turns 31 next month.

Savage's inexorable weight gain, which began in middle school and resulted in obesity, was not her only problem: For years, she also struggled with eruptions of painful acne and facial hair. ""These things made me feel ugly,"" she said.

Last year, after Savage had trouble getting pregnant, an inability she suspected was linked to her irregular periods, she consulted a new obstetrician/gynecologist. The doctor suggested that Savage's constellation of problems might have a single cause. But it took a second OB/GYN to conduct the proper tests, which led to a definitive diagnosis of a common -- and consequential -- disorder.

""It's frustrating to me that so many doctors"" didn't think of this, she said. ""If I'd known, I would have made changes years ago.""

From the time she was 12, Savage recalled, her inability to lose weight became one of the defining elements of her life. And because she is short -- 5-foot-3 -- extra pounds were particularly noticeable. Her family's comparisons with her older, thinner sister rankled.

At her mother's suggestion, Savage joined a gym, but that didn't help her lose more than a few pounds.

Savage said she was too intimidated to ask her doctors why her weight didn't budge much, even when she faithfully followed a diet and worked out.

Nor did she mention the other problems that plagued her. ""The facial hair thing was embarrassing, so I didn't want to talk about it,"" she recalled. ""Same with the acne. I felt so sensitive about it.""

Savage wasn't sure what to make of her irregular menstrual periods, but doctors did not seem concerned. At times she went three months without a period; at other times they lasted for two weeks. She managed to lose a little weight in college, but her acne and other problems persisted.

✕ What if men had periods?

In her early 20s, Savage said, her gynecologist chided her about how heavy she was; every year, she seemed to gain 10 pounds. ""I explained that I had tried diet and exercise, but he said I was not trying hard enough,"" Savage recalled.

To regulate her menstrual cycle and tame her acne, the doctor prescribed oral contraceptives, which helped clear her skin and made her periods somewhat less irregular.

When she got married in 2010, Savage and her husband joined a popular weight-loss program to see whether they could motivate each other.

Savage said she lost only about eight pounds after several months, while her husband, who followed the same diet, had no trouble shedding much more weight.

""It was very frustrating,"" she recalled. ""I was serious about following the rules, but it didn't pay off. I kind of gave up.""

By early 2015, she was desperate. She had stopped taking the pill nearly a year earlier, in hopes of getting pregnant; without it, her acne had roared back and her facial-hair problem had worsened. Savage was at her heaviest weight -- about 240 pounds -- and her family doctor warned that her cholesterol, at 210 mg/dL, was too high.

In March, she switched gynecologists. Her new doctor zeroed in on her irregular periods and her weight and asked Savage whether she had heard of a metabolic disorder called polycystic ovarian (or ovary) syndrome.

Savage replied that a friend in college had been diagnosed with PCOS. She was surprised when the doctor responded that she suspected Savage might have it, too.

An explanation at last

PCOS is a common hormonal imbalance that often begins in puberty and affects as many as 10 percent of women. Its cause is unknown, but heredity appears to play a role: Women whose mothers or sisters have the disorder are at higher risk. Many women with PCOS have enlarged ovaries containing fluid-filled cysts that produce excess androgens -- male sex hormones, which interfere with ovulation. Other signs of PCOS include irregular, absent or prolonged periods, acne and excess facial and body hair, a condition known as hirsutism.

Because it also disrupts the regulation of insulin, many women with PCOS are overweight or obese. The disorder, which can be controlled but not cured, also increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart attack.

The gynecologist told Savage that she also suffered from PCOS. When Savage asked whether it was possible to test for the disorder, she said that the gynecologist told her, erroneously, that there were no tests. The best way to treat the problem was to lose weight, the doctor advised. And, the gynecologist added, she held weight-loss seminars in her office and urged Savage to sign up.

Savage declined. Two weeks later, she consulted a third OB/GYN, Neil Horlick, who practices in Montgomery and Frederick counties.

Horlick, after taking her history and performing an exam, said he suspected she had PCOS. When Savage told him she had been told there was no test for it, he assured her that testing was available and that he would order it.

Because abnormalities of the thyroid or adrenal glands can cause similar symptoms, those must be ruled out first. PCOS is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion, made on the basis of blood tests, a patient's symptoms and an ultrasound of the ovaries.

""We generally look for two out of three criteria for PCOS,"" Horlick said. These include a history of irregular or absent periods, elevated levels of male hormones, particularly testosterone, and the presence of ovarian cysts. In Savage's case, an ultrasound showed no cysts, but she did have an elevated testosterone level.

Horlick said he was surprised that Savage's condition went undiagnosed for so long. ""PCOS is always on our radar"" when a patient with irregular periods complains of weight gain and hirsutism, Horlick said.

He told Savage that her best chance of getting pregnant involved losing weight. Horlick prescribed metformin, a diabetes drug that can promote weight loss. Metformin is commonly given to PCOS patients and may help promote ovulation as well.

Savage decided to take a new approach to food. She began following a paleo diet, which emphasizes meat, vegetables, nuts and fruit, and drastically reduces the intake of carbohydrates, sugar and processed foods.

The first month, she said, she was elated to discover that she had lost 15 pounds; between April and September, she shed 50 pounds and her cholesterol dropped 20 points. Her acne also improved, her level of testosterone dropped, and her menstrual cycle became more regular.

Savage said she asked relatives whether anyone else had been diagnosed with PCOS. ""My parents had never heard of it,"" she said.

In October 2015, she and her husband were elated to learn that she was pregnant with identical twin boys. Savage spent six weeks hospitalized at Maryland's Shady Grove Medical Center under close observation, because her twins have a rare condition in which they share a single amniotic sac and placenta, a condition unrelated to PCOS. The babies were born April 22.

Savage said she hopes that her experience will spare other women from ""struggling for years the way I did.""

"Actual suggestions from article: Donate it, throw in the ocean, bake world's largest pizza, make cheese sculptures, shoot into the sun, put on the moon. ",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/17/cheese-america-surplus-donation,"As if we didn’t already have enough to worry about, what with the never-ending wars, economic inequality, prejudice, and the latest Drake album being very underwhelming to be perfectly honest, now I find out we have too much cheese.

According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, the United States has an overwhelming surplus of cheese, enough to equal three extra pounds of the stuff for every person in the country. If that’s really the case, then I eagerly await my share of this glorious bounty. Just ship it over in some dry ice, Obama. This hot tub I just installed in my back yard will make an excellent fondue pot.

The unfortunate dark side of this situation is that the overproduction of cheese by dairy farmers has tanked the price of their number one product, costing the industry millions of dollars in lost revenue. Michigan dairy farmer Carla Wardin told the Journal that her colleagues plan to deal with the situation by “do[ing] the same thing … you milk more cows”.

If dairy farmers refuse to stop making cheese, I suppose the only solution to this problem is to quickly, efficiently dispose of the cheese surplus. How are we going to do that? Glad you asked, because I have a few brilliant solutions. In fact, these are so clever that you might as well start calling me the Elon Musk of dairy products:

Donate the cheese to the hungry

According to the United Nations World Food Programme, 795 million people on the planet don’t have enough food to lead a healthy life. That’s about two and a half times the population of the US, but there’s enough surplus cheese here to give each of those hungry people 1.5 pounds. Even though cheese is not particularly healthy, and some people are lactose intolerant, some cheese is still better than no cheese, which also happens to be my rule at cocktail parties during the passed appetizer period.

All the extra cheese would be gone, dairy farmers could milk cows as much as they pleased, the price of cheese would soar, and the world’s starving masses would be able to enjoy a spot of brie that pairs excellently with a glass of pinot noir. There are no losers here.



Of course, that’s not what will happen. Here are scenarios far more likely than an act of kindness by the dairy industry:

Dump the cheese in the ocean

There’s already an island of trash in the middle of the Pacific Ocean the size of the state of Texas that no one seems to be bothered by, though there’s a decent chance that if Donald Trump finds out about it, he’ll promise to drop a nuke on it.

Besides the horrific effect a pile of garbage has on our marine ecosystem, it’s also not at all edible. You can’t eat an island of refuse, but you certainly can eat a large, floating mound of cheese. It’ll be a great place for cruise ships to stop for a cheesy photo opp. Plus, you can take a hunk of it home, like the Berlin Wall – at least until the whole thing melts and kills all the fish. But hey, think about what that will do to the price of fish! Cash those checks now, folks.

Bake the world’s largest pizza

We haven’t sent an astronaut to the moon in decades. Infrastructure projects that used to thrill the human imagination are now seen as major inconveniences at best, and at worst, blatant government overreach. New skyscraper height records are met with the sort of shrug usually reserved for the newest Katherine Heigl movie.

It’s time to inspire this great nation again. The only thing I can think of that really excites Americans is pizza. Every time I’ve seen a mega-pizza delivered to a home or a place of business, people gather around and poke at it with a stick like the monkeys from the beginning of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Pizza is the real final frontier, so let’s take that cheese and bake the largest pizza of all time.

The Guinness Book of World Records states that the biggest pie of all time was baked in Italy in December of 2012 by a man named Dovilio Nardi. It was 1,261.5 square meters – 13,580ft to us Yanks. That this pizza holds the record is shameful.

First of all, it’s gluten-free. Second, there’s no pepperoni, no mushrooms and no buffalo chicken – no toppings at all. But the most heinous crime is that the crust is not stuffed. If America made a giant pizza, you’d better believe that we would stuff the hell out of that crust. There’d be cheese, bacon, sausage, ranch dressing and if you’re lucky, a 2016 Chevy Malibu free to whomever is able to eat their way to it first.

Erect cheese sculptures in every city

If our current reevaluation of former presidents like Woodrow Wilson and Andrew Jackson are any indication, it is inevitable that every great American we revere now will eventually be found out as a murderer, a sadist or a racist. Why bother going through the tedious process of removing their names from buildings, taking them off currency or tearing down their statues? Why not just henceforth make each monument out of cheese? That way, they eventually rot and we have to toss them in a dumpster to get rid of the awful, awful smell of old gruyere. By the time the revelations of anti-social behavior come out, the cheese monument will be long gone.

Shoot it all into the sun with a rocket

This would be similar to the scene in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, when Superman collects all the nuclear weapons on the planet and hurls them into the sun to avert a global holocaust. Except it’s cheese.

Put it on the moon

In the same vein as the Superman IV solution, I propose we leave the cheese on the moon. It will probably be just fine sitting up there with no oxygen-based microorganisms to rot it. Remember how people once thought the moon was made of cheese? Well, now it will be. A dream no longer deferred.

Whatever we do, though, let’s make sure we don’t give it all away to someone who needs it. That would be un-American.",America is drowning in surplus cheese. What should we do with it all? | Dave Schilling

The girl’s mother described how jihadi fighters had set fire to the family home in Mosul, northern Iraq, after they failed to pay a religious tax on time.

The tax, known as the Jaziya, is imposed on all non-Muslims in Isis controlled territories and is calculated according to their estimated net worth.

The unnamed mother described how “foreign” Isis fighters had arrived at her door and said she had two choices, either “you are to leave now or you are to pay the Jaziya"".

Human rights advocate, Jacqueline Issac, said the mother told them she would pay, but asked for a “few seconds” as her daughter was in the shower.

The jihadis reportedly refused to wait and lit the house with a torch immediately.

Both the mother and her daughter managed to escape the burning house, but the child died from her fourth degree burns a few hours later.

Ms Issac told the Daily Express: “The daughter had fourth degree burns and the mother took her daughter, scrambling, doing anything to save her.

“She rushed her to the hospital and her daughter died in her arms.

“The last thing her daughter said was: ‘Forgive them’.”

Last week, a leading cleric in Baghdad said the country’s ancient Christian population could disappear within five years because of the Isis threat.

Father Martin Hermis Dawood said he used to advise members of his congregation who were contemplating fleeing the country to stay strong, but since the emergence of the terror group two years ago he had told them to go.

Iraqi Christian leaders estimate the total number of Chaldean Catholics, Syrian Orthodox and members of the eastern Assyrian church - the main denominations in the country - has declined from 1.3 million people 20 years ago to just 400,000 today, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Father Dawood said: “We are in the middle, we have seen it. When newspapers published cartoons about the Prophet Mohammed, it was in Europe, but gangs tried to assault Christians here. Something happened in Belgium or in Holland, I paid here.

“We know very well that not every Muslim here is a terrorist, but there is a culture rising, not only here in Iraq, but in the Middle East. There’s a struggle happening in the whole world and we will be burned in this fire in the future.”",'Forgive Isis': Girl's dying request to mother after she is burnt alive by militants in her own home

Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic.

Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said.

Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones.

Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food?

The answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward. Here, we explore this hotly contested issue.

What the heck does organic mean anyway?

Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed.

“By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,” Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email.

When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says “100 percent organic” indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. “Organic,” on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while “made with organic ingredients” is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients.

There’s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an “excuse to charge more.”

Indeed, there’s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are.

Still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not.

A 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and “substantially higher” levels of antioxidants.

So, what does this mean for human health?

According to the Environmental Working Group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the USDA in 2014 contained pesticide residues. In some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled.

Pesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's to cancer and birth defects.

The jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health.

In the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency.

“We’re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis,” said Michael Crupain, the director of Consumer Reports’ Food Safety and Sustainability Center, in an earlier post. “It’s not realistic to expect we wouldn’t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal. We just don’t know enough about the health effects.”

Some organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects.

When it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, there's also conflicting data.

The 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods. A meta-analysis published two years later in the British Journal of Nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds.

A recent study, published in February, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids.

“Omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function,” wrote study co-author Chris Seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the U.K.’s Newcastle University. “But getting enough in our diet is difficult. Our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients.”

As for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut.

The Centers for Disease Control notes that ""[s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health"" because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop. So choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue.

Other ways of measuring “worth”:

When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth’s well-being, too.

“When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,” she told HuffPost. “Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me.”

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health.

But organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit.

Thomas Barwick/Getty Images

Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation.

Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large.

“Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,” he said. “It’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly.”

According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers.

“Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,” the nonprofit writes.

Many organic farms are small operations, though ""big organic"" farms do exist as well. If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you're often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce.

Organic on a budget

Regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just “buy organic to the extent you can, when you can.”

And there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply):

1. Prioritize your purchases.

“It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,” advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University’s Pancreas Center, in a blog post.

She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible.

“Some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,” she said.

Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. “The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,” said Lu.

For produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable.

“Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,” said Gerszberg.

The Environmental Working Group's “Dirty Dozen” and “Clean Fifteen” lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The “clean” list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower.

2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce.

Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative.

“The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor,” writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont. “Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities.”

Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient. It also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation.

It's estimated that the average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture. In contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less.

3. Buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too.

Many mainstream supermarkets, including Safeway, Target, Wal-Mart and H-E-B, carry organic store-brand options, while Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's sell organic foodstuffs in bulk. Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products.

4. Keep an eye out for sales and coupons. Sites like All Natural Savings and Organic Deals can help customers surface organic food deals.

5. Grow your own food. It might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isn't as difficult as it sounds. It just requires a bit of effort and patience.

The bottom line

So is buying organic worth it? Depending on your priorities, it might be. Ultimately, many experts agree that eating a balanced diet, while remaining conscientious about how your food choices impact the health of the planet and farming communities, is key.

Media and Political elites. ,http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/05/31/obama_s_new_overtime_regulations_draw_complaints_from_media_activists.html,"Noam Scheiber at the New York Times posted a fantastic piece Monday about a surprising source of opposition to the Obama administration’s new overtime regulations: media and political elites.

As of Dec. 1, the law will require employers to pay the vast majority of salaried employees earning less than $47,476 annually overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours a week, double the current standard. As Vice President Joe Biden said when he announced the new regulations earlier this month, “If you work overtime, you should actually get paid for working overtime.”

The administration estimates this will raise the pay of more than 4 million workers by $12 billion over the next decade. And if an employer doesn’t want to pay the bill? Well, employees gain free time.

Sounds great, right?

Not, apparently, if you are a New York publishing insider. “You want to bump into the boss at 8 o’clock at night,” Dan Reynolds, the chief executive of Workman Publishing and a man otherwise known as, uh, the boss, told Scheiber.

Or a political activist.

In a statement released shortly after the rules were announced, Andre Delattre, the executive director of the United States Public Interest Research Group, better known as US PIRG, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization, whined, “A person of means—in service of a cause to which they feel deeply committed—can volunteer to work for our organization for free for as many hours as they wish, but a person of lesser means—who is no less committed to the work we do—cannot agree to work for our organization for less than $47,476 without having their work hours strictly limited in order to keep our costs affordable.”

What’s going on here?

When the Obama administration first announced their intention to reform the overtime regulations two years ago, some of the most vehement protest came from employers of low-wage workers, like the fast food industry. And little wonder.

While hourly workers are almost always eligible for overtime pay, salaried workers are not—unless, that is, they earn less than the overtime threshold. When that amount was set at the current $23,660, there was an easy enough dodge. Give someone a managerial or professional title, and you were all but home free. While some companies—Hi, Chipotle!—have been sued by current and former employees who allege that their highfalutin’ job descriptions did not match the reality of their less than impressive responsibilities, it seems all but certain the vast majority got away with the practice.

Advertisement

The new rules are, of course, an attempt to do away with this rather disgraceful behavior. But raising the issue brought another uncomfortable truth to light. Employers in lower-prestige professions like fast food are not the only ones treating employees unfairly. Any number of higher-end, more prestigious industries were relying on the business model, too. Scheiber calls it “The Devil Wears Prada economy,” after the famed Lauren Weisberger novel, widely thought to be about her time working for Vogue’s Anna Wintour.

This is, of course, something of an established path for career advancement. You work long hours at your intro job—like, say, editorial assistant, or political canvasser, or would-be Hollywood agent—and try to take on extra duties as well, in the hopes the boss will notice you and promote you up.

Advertisement

This model has its supporters, including Slate’s Jordan Weissman, who wrote last year, “while overtime functions pretty well when it’s used to discourage companies from working vulnerable employees in low-skill positions to the bone, it’s not necessarily appropriate in creative industries where educated young people are out to make a name for themselves and margins are thin.”

However, an argument could be made that by enabling this sort of behavior at the more prestigious ends of the labor market, we are making the practice more acceptable for everyone by normalizing it.

Americans, somewhat famously, are a nation of workaholics. In 2014, a Gallup survey found that the average American claimed to be putting in 47 hours a week on the job. As I pointed out last year, most of us seem to think that’s proper, or at least acceptable. We idealize Silicon Valley, where outsize workweeks are the norm.

Advertisement

Yet this sort of time on the job is not exactly effective. Academic studies show that work performance deteriorates rapidly after someone puts in more than 50 hours a week. In fact, the drop-off point might even come after significantly fewer hours on the job. An Australian survey recently found that for people over the age of 40, performance began to decline after a mere 25 hours a week.

Moreover, it’s easy to suspect that the bosses claiming that their underlings are desperate to work long hours for low pay are telling themselves what they want to hear.

Advertisement

A quick tour of Glass Door, a site for job listings and career advice, makes it clear that many of US PIRG’s employees and former employees have a different take. “Take better care of your employees. Invest in them. Give them the financial resources to have a live outside of work,” one wrote the week after the new regulations were announced. “With such a low pay and laborious workload, it’s hard for people to make it a long-term job,” a former canvasser claimed. “Very long hours, high turnover, terrible work/life balance - employees are expected to devote almost all their time to their jobs (80+ hours a week),” wrote a third.

Liberals like to point fingers when people like presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims, “Wages are too high,” because, as he put it a Republican debate last November, “People have to go out, they have to work really hard and they have to get into that upper stratum.” But as the US PIRG example reveals, it turned out they—OK, we—have something of a problem of our own.

The truth is this: Underpaid overwork is underpaid overwork, and it shouldn’t matter if you are serving burritos at Chipotle, making Anna Wintour’s manicure appointments, or lobbying for political change. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. That means getting paid for every hour spent on the job, not to mention getting a break from it.","Obama’s new overtime regulations draw complaints from media, activists."

Flirty Prince Harry can't keep away from glamorous US soldier at Invictus Games - there's just one problem

Prince Harry looks like he's smitten with US soldier Sergeant Elizabeth Marks - meeting her several times at his Invictus Games.

The flirtatious meetings between the two have set social media alight as the pair spent a number of hours together.

They were pictured together after the 25-year-old came first in the 100 metre freestyle with the Prince, 31, seemingly mesmerised by her leg-length tattoo.

They then shared a moving moment when Sergeant Marks gave Harry back the medal - one of four golds she won in the pool - asking him instead to deliver it to doctors and nurses at the British hospital that saved her life.

Sergeant Marks clearly found Harry hilarious as they were seen joking and laughing together as he tried on one of her US team tops.

“As soon as they met they just hit it off,” said a spectator.

“Sergeant Marks is extremely attractive and Harry clearly took a little bit of a shine to her after all what she has achieved.

“But when she asked for her medal to be given to doctors and nurses who saved her life back home he, like all of us, was bowled over.”

The next day they met up again with a kiss on the cheek as they were both spectating at the wheelchair rugby tournament.

Two years ago on the eve of competing in the first Invictus Games in London, Sgt Marks fell gravely ill when she collapsed with a lung condition.

Her trouble began on the flight over to the UK when she began losing her voice.

Initially she thought it was due to the amount of interviews she had done but by the time the plane landed in London, she couldn’t breathe and was taken to the Royal London Hospital and admitted for what they believed was pneumonia.

A specialist team from Papworth Hospital was brought in who placed her in an induced coma.

Speaking about her ordeal Sgt Marks said: “I landed in London and became very ill very rapidly, I was in hospital in London and went into respiratory distress syndrome, they shipped a team down from Papworth who put me on to ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] life support and that ultimately saved my life.

“And when they did so I was on it for 10 days and ended up waking in an army hospital in Germany having no idea what had happened.

“But they absolutely saved my life and I can’t thank the UK enough for having that kind of medical support and taking such good care of me.""

Sgt Marks joined the US army when she was 17 years old.

She suffered debilitating hip injuries in Iraq in 2010 that left her with no feeling in her left leg.

The Army evacuated her and flew her to Brooke Army Medical Centre in San Antonio, Texas, where she began a gruelling recovery.

She underwent three surgeries to restructure her hips and regain enough mobility to walk.

Doctors never determined what caused the illness and although the ECMO saved her life it left her with some neurological impairment.

Arizona-born Sgt Marks now hopes to repeat her success at the Invictus Games at Rio’s Paralympics in September.

She is ranked number one in the world in the 100-meter breaststroke with a time of 1:30.44, according to the International Paralympic Committee.

Women. ,http://elitedaily.com/envision/which-demographic-buys-gas-guzzling-suvs-the-most/1508536/,"You know those big SUVs that rush by you on the highway with no regard for human life? Most of them are purchased by one particular demographic.

According to CarBuzz, SUV sales are skyrocketing as more fuel-efficient sport utility vehicles are introduced to the once struggling marketing. But who's buying them the most? You'll NEVER guess...

Believe it or not, women are actually purchasing more SUVs than men, according to recent data and research by Michigan-based firm MartizCX.

Mainstream small SUV sales to women increased by nearly 34 percent compared to a 22 percent increase in mainstream small SUV sales to men between 2010 and 2015. Within the women purchasing SUVs, 40 percent are single and unmarried.

Premium small SUV sales to women soared by 177 percent over the same 5 years.

But why?

TIME links the increased female-dominant SUV sales to a rise in income and educational attainment and a drop in marriages and child-bearing.

MartizCX reveals,

There's a group of single, professional females out there that need vehicles, and you need to be attentive to them.

It looks like single, professional females gravitate more toward practical, fuel-efficient SUVs rather than sports coupes and luxury sedans.

So far, the top five best-selling SUVs in 2016 are: Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Ford Explorer, and the Nissan Rogue respectively.

By the early hours of Friday 24 June, it will be clear if the UK has defied the experts and pollsters by voting to leave the European Union.

If that happens, a shattered David Cameron, his leadership already a matter of speculation, will have no option but to make a statement outside 10 Downing Street saying he will respect the mandate of the British people. The Treasury, Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) will move quickly to roll out well-hidden battle plans to prevent market chaos.

A shocked European political class will find itself grappling with an unprecedented, messy and sprawling divorce that could rumble on for years.

The EU will respond as it does to any crisis, and convene an emergency summit, probably as early as the weekend.

As the morning unfolds it will quickly become clear that although the basic Brexit procedures are set down in law with some clarity, the politics, timeframe and potentially explosive brinkmanship will bring deep uncertainty and new disputes between the Brexiters and Europe.

EU commission officials, for instance, claim the UK will rapidly discover it has put itself in the role of supplicant, and they even talk of throwing the country out on its ear. Jean-Claude Juncker has already warned the UK should remember that deserters are not greeted with open arms.

“It is in our interest to do the divorce as quickly as possible. There’s no appetite for negotiating new terms in the first two years,” one source says.



Others, mainly in the leave campaign, contend that a more stately, considered pace to the divorce is possible. They deny the EU holds all the cards in shaping a new relationship between an independent UK and a jilted Europe.

The high watermark of summer: as the Glastonbury faithful turn their attention to the headliners, and football fans gear up for the knockout phases of the European championships, officials in London and Brussels will be weighing a very different knockout. Rapidly the discussion will move to the processes of Brexit, and the irreversibility of the decision. Only Greenland (on achieving self-rule) and Algeria (on gaining independence from France) have left the European bloc, and the only legal pathway out of the current EU is through article 50, inserted in the 2009 Lisbon treaty. This allows a country two years to negotiate the terms of its exit from the moment it notifies the EU of its intention to leave. A Brexit vote does not represent that formal notification. Those playing for time will argue that six weeks must be allowed for legal challenges to the referendum result, so at the very least it might be best to wait for the result to be immune from legal interference.

But once the notification is triggered, negotiations cannot extend beyond a two-year notice period, unless all remaining EU member states agree to such an extension. It would therefore take just one member state to insist the divorce must happen at the end of the two years. Arguably, and this will be contested, the UK could at some point in the two years reverse its decision to leave. If, for instance, the deal offered by the EU were very poor, nothing in the EU treaty would prevent the UK government going back to a largely pro-remain UK parliament to seek a second referendum.

Week one

The EU’s instinctive response to a UK Brexit vote will be one of self preservation. An emergency summit is likely to seek the equivalent of the “Draghi moment” when the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, announced he would do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. With markets in turmoil, and Eurosceptics across Europe emboldened, the European political class will want a joint declaration of a determination to continue, possibly as an even more integrated Europe.

Divisions will start to emerge. Countries with strong ties to the UK such as Malta, Cyprus and Poland may plead for caution. Slovakia, which will hold the presidency of the council in the second half of 2016, is reluctant to see the UK go. The inclination across Brussels will be to treat the UK harshly so Brexit cannot be presented to other sceptical states as a cost-free option. “It will be imperative to prevent the Brexit contagion gripping other countries,” says one EU official. The French and Germans, facing challenges from their own Eurosceptics in 2017 elections, will demand action. They will want to know what kind of future relations with Europe the UK proposes. At issue will be the UK access to the single market and the continuance of the free movement of labour.

Andrew Duff, a former Liberal Democrat MEP, who helped devise article 50, says: “The EU could not allow a seceding state to spin things out for too long. The clause puts most of the cards in the hands of those that stay in.”

By the end of the week, the UK may find itself excluded from some EU meetings as the remaining 27 decide how to structure the withdrawal negotiations, based on proposals from the executive commission.

Week two

Inside the UK, Cameron will either fall on his sword, prompting a leadership contest at a point of economic turmoil, or say he has a duty to negotiate an exit, perhaps staying on until the autumn.

He has said he would immediately trigger article 50 because “the British people would rightly expect that to start straight away”. George Osborne has said that “this is crucially important, the one way the European Union itself has a legal basis to negotiate our exit is to trigger article 50. Article 50 would be triggered immediately and that process would begin.” The trigger would be pulled with a fortnight, Osborne added.

However, Dominic Cummings, the campaign director for Vote Leave, says an immediate move to set article 50 in motion would be “mad and like putting a gun into your mouth and pulling the trigger”.

Meanwhile, Michael Gove claims the remarks by Cameron and Osborne need to be filtered through the prism of the referendum campaign. It is in the interests of Cameron and the commission to play up the risk of a Brexit vote.

In reality, once defeated in the referendum the political authority of the Cameron-Osborne axis will have been blown away. The mantle will have passed to Gove, and to Boris Johnson. Both men have said there is no need to rush to the exit door.

The next few weeks

The shell-shocked 450-strong majority for remain in the House of Commons will have gathered its forces. A consensus will form that it would be best for all sides to take their time.

From Cummings’ point of view, time will be needed over the summer for the EU to admit it is in its self-interest to retain a close trading relationship with the UK. At play will be the UK’s continued membership of the single market, and free movement of EU citizens.

But Agata Gostyńska-Jakubowska of the pro-EU Centre for European Reform says delaying for too long “might be unacceptable for the EU partners”, further eroding goodwill and weakening their negotiating hand. The UK, by extending the agony, would be an unwanted participant in EU meetings.

So politically Britain will not be able to delay in perpetuity, and by the autumn the pressure for an article 50 notification will be overwhelming.

Once the article 50 trigger is pulled, the EU council of ministers, now certain that Brexit is happening, will by qualified majority voting agree a negotiation mandate, in the form of directives to the commission.

The full scale of the task facing Whitehall will become clear. The UK will have to renegotiate 80,000 pages of EU agreements, deciding those to be kept in UK law and those to jettison. British officials have said privately that nobody knows how long this would take, but some ministers say it would clog up parliament for years. Greenland, with a population of 55,000, took two years to negotiate its exit.

Brexiters often point to farming or fisheries as relatively easy to negotiate, yet 60% of UK food and drink exports go to the EU and 60% of fish. The EU and Norway spend four months negotiating a fisheries deal for 40 stocks. Yet EU-UK fisheries negotiations would have to contend with 140 stocks.

A senior UK official said: “The honest answer is nobody knows how long this would take and we would all be making it up.”

Winter 2016

One scenario is that the first set of negotiations surrounding withdrawal will be completed inside two years. They will cover issues such as residual EU budget payments to and from Britain, the acquired rights of UK citizens in Europe and the reciprocal rights of EU citizens in the UK, the pensions of British EU civil servants and relocation of EU agencies based in the UK.

However, longer-term issues such as future trade relations, including tariffs, are likely to be dealt with separately.

The negotiations will be grinding on, and the Brexit campaign may find some of its optimism about a new trade deal was unfounded. Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, has claimed “we will be able to trade with the single market on free-trade terms, without paying into the system or accepting freedom of movement”. He insists that access will be tariff-free, and that the UK is uniquely well placed to strike such a deal thanks to its large trade deficit with major EU countries. Elliott has reasoned: “I cannot imagine, the day after Britain votes to leave, Angela Merkel allowing a situation where the British markets were cut off for BMW or any of the other companies. Ditto the French farmers, the Italian fashion companies and what have you.”

Others say this is overly optimistic. Cameron, for instance, has pointed out that 44% of UK exports go to the European Union, while just 8% of what the EU exports goes the other way. In short, he says, Britain is the one in greatest need of an agreement.

Striking a trade deal on services, especially the critical financial services, will be difficult as France and Ireland eye a chance to end the dominance of the City of London, and grab business. Equally UK negotiators will find it hard to get countries such as China interested in negotiating a separate trade deal with the UK, as opposed to the whole EU.

As all this emerges from the Brussels negotiations, the UK parliament may assert itself and demand a closer relationship with the EU than the one envisaged by Brexiters. One model is offered by Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area. Another is Switzerland’s relationship with the EU – in effect a series of bilateral treaties.

MPs will start to use the Commons to rein in Gove and Johnson. If no trade deal is struck they will become increasingly worried as the UK will have no choice but to trade with the rest of Europe under World Trade Organisation rules.

The House of Commons foreign affairs committee recently spelled out the implication of this: “If no deal could be concluded within the two-year notice period, the UK would move to standard WTO relationship terms and would then need to decide which of the 6,987 directly applicable EU regulations would need to be replaced by UK law.”

The French and German elections will be over. Eurosceptic parties will possibly have suffered because of the evident difficulties the UK is experiencing in its negotiations. The drawbacks of life outside the EU will have been clear to French and German voters.

Let’s imagine one far from implausible outcome. The EU has played hardball with the UK and the deadline for Brexit is imminent. Last-minute talks are due to start, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, insists he will bat for Britain through the night. With few bargaining chips at his disposal, he strikes a deal on the narrow terms of the UK exit but the future trading relationship is unclear. By default, Britain will cease to be a member of the European Union and will trade with Europe under WTO rules outside the single market, facing tariffs on exports.

This deal – such as it is – will need to be agreed by a qualified majority in the council of ministers. Any remaining UK allies in the council will be outvoted. Consent of both the European and UK parliaments will then be required, followed by ratification by member states. The UK, now outside the EU, will return to Brussels to reopen its trade talks.

It took 12 years to get into Europe and, the UK may discover, it will take just as long to get through the exit door.",What happens next if Britain votes to leave the EU?
Cancel the Paris Climate Plan. ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/05/27/donald-trump-just-made-an-extremely-important-promise-its-one-of-his-worst-yet/,"The near-term political consequences of this will — or should — be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely. I don’t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it’s likely Sanders will see it this way, too.

To get all the details on Trump’s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer’s piece. Trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue GOP agenda of “fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production.” More important, with some reporters wondering what Trump’s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: He is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we’re currently putting in place to deal with it.

Trump said that the current environmental challenges that the Obama administration is trying to tackle are “phony.” He added that he would “rescind” the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the U.S.’s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. He would withdraw the U.S. from participation in that global accord.

As I’ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a Republican president — even one as masterfully competent and strong as Trump — to roll back the Clean Power Plan and/or withdraw from the Paris climate deal. But it’s possible that Trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback.

This deepens the contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton. While Clinton would not be as ambitious as Sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that Clinton would preserve and implement the Clean Power Plan and the global climate accord, and Trump would seek to reverse them both.

Sanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face:

Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016

And:

As a father of four and a grandfather of seven, I care about leaving a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016

It’s true that Sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient. But Sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it — and the Clean Power Plan — are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Sanders knows that the Paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem. Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. What’s more, even if the Paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. The accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. Obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible.

It is often said that Sanders may not help to unify the party because he has “nothing to lose” from a Democratic loss. I think that is wrong — I believe Sanders when he says a Trump presidency is unthinkable. And at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor Sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement’s influence going forward. Trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by Sanders’ own lights, we all have to lose from a Trump presidency. My bet is Sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to Trump’s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative.

* DOWN TO THE WIRE IN CALIFORNIA: Politico reports that the Clinton campaign thinks it might eke out a win over Bernie Sanders in California, due to the latter’s strategic errors:

The biggest problem for Sanders has to do with independent voters….Those voters can vote in the Democratic primary, but to do so they must request a Democratic ballot….Educating those independent voters about the clunky process was part of a [previous Sanders campaign] field organizing strategy…But the campaign decided to go in a different direction, instead focusing its dwindling resources on television advertising.

The likely close outcome means the delegate math will remain unchanged, though a lot of people will make claims about what the “narrative” of a Clinton defeat there supposedly means.

* NEW EXPLANATION FOR HILLARY EMAIL SETUP: A former State Department official has offered a new explanation in a deposition as part of a lawsuit by a conservative group:

Lewis A. Lukens, a former State Department administrative official, said in a sworn deposition last week that after Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, he had proposed accommodating her by setting up a desktop computer in her office that would not be connected to the department’s system. That would have allowed her to send and receive email on a personal account….But that idea was abandoned, Mr. Lukens testified, after an aide to the secretary told him that Mrs. Clinton was “very comfortable checking her emails on a BlackBerry, but she’s not adept or not used to checking her emails on a desktop.”

Clinton is frustrated that she can’t move past the drip-drip-drip nature of this story, but that isn’t going to happen until the FBI releases its findings, and even then it will probably continue.

* TRUMP’S GROUND GAME IS ‘NONEXISTENT’: The Associated Press recently reported that the Trump campaign is ramping up its organization in 15 states. NBC News reports that’s nonsense:

On the ground, there are few signs the action of building a large campaign apparatus is underway. One Trump campaign source told NBC News that boasting to the AP of 15 state directors being deployed was a “piece ginned up to make it seem like we’re doing something when we’re not.”….“It’s either fluid or non-existent,” the source continued, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “I would lean towards the latter.”

The question now is whether the RNC can make up for it and build an operation for him.

* REPUBLICANS SCRAMBLE TO BUILD TRUMP A GROUND GAME: Related to the above, Politico reports:

The Republican National Committee is scrambling to respond to increasingly frantic concerns from state GOP officials that the party has not provided enough field organizers and will be badly outgunned by Democrats in battleground states. POLITICO surveyed nearly two dozen GOP chairmen, officials and operatives in key swing states who said the RNC hadn’t delivered on promises, putting in peril their ability to launch the robust voter-turnout operation needed in the general election.

But surely Trump’s candidacy is so “uncoventional” that none of this will matter.

* REPUBLICANS WORRY ABOUT TRUMP’S FINANCE OPERATION: David Drucker reports that Republicans are wondering whether Trump can build up a fundraising operation in time:

The problem is that fundraising networks don’t bring in hundreds of millions of dollars overnight….The RNC has had a very successful election cycle fundraising, bringing in $144.8 million thus far, with $17.4 million in the bank as of April 30. But the demands of running a presidential campaign, as charged to do by Trump, are going to require considerably more money, and fast. Republicans in down-ticket races wonder if there is going to be any cash left over to help them.

Maybe if Trump brashly promises a “world class” finance operation enough times, one will eventually materialize.

* TRUMP IS CONFIDENT HE’LL BROADEN THE MAP: On the campaign trail last night, Trump talked about how competitive he’ll be in states off limits to Republicans. Jenna Johnson summarizes his argument:

Which states will Trump target? California. Ohio, where he plans to spend a lot of money. Michigan. New York, his home state which was once represented by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the U.S. Senate. Florida, where he owns several golf resorts and a private club where he often lives. And Virginia, which is also home to a Trump golf course.

California and New York? Sorry, but no. Michigan? Maybe. But to make that happen, he’d have to pull off a large double digit swing among those blue collar whites that supposedly love him so much.

* TRUMP’S BOGUS ECONOMIC CREDENTIALS: Paul Krugman takes apart the idea that Donald Trump’s supposedly formidable business skills equip him to run the country:

Does business success carry with it the knowledge and instincts needed to make good economic policy?

But does this describe anyone currently running for president?

Its very likely. ,http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/north-korea-bank/484628/?utm_campaign=fuckapathy,"A security research company has found ties between $81 million stolen from the central bank of Bangladesh, the Sony email hacks, and bank thefts across the world.

Security investigators linked thefts from banks in Asia, including the $81 million stolen from the central bank of Bangladesh in February, to a hacking group in North Korea.

The research firm Symantec has been looking into the Bangladesh bank heist, and on Thursday it posted on its blog that a similar code used to steal Bangladesh’s millions was also used to hack a bank in the Philippines, as well as a failed attempt on a bank in Vietnam last year. The code, Symantec said, has also been linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures’s emails.

Investigators say the malware the thieves used shared similarities to the code used by a hacking group known as Lazarus. The FBI has linked this group to the Sony hacks, and those hacks to North Korea. That group has also been tied to attacks as far back as 2009, which mainly focused on the U.S. and South Korea, but it is also believed to be responsible for hacks on countries all over the world, such as the $12 million stolen from an Ecuadoran bank last year.

The way hackers broke into the banks was by infiltrating the industry’s global messaging system, SWIFT. The system is run by the world’s largest banks, is based in Brussels, and prides itself on security.

The New York Times adds:

North Korea’s economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations. Pyongyang does not publish economic data, but estimates have put North Korea’s gross domestic product between $12 billion and $40 billion, tiny when compared with South Korea’s economic output of more than $1.4 trillion.

An expert quoted by the Times said: “If you presume it’s North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P. This is not small change for them.”

Since investigators learned how hackers stole Bangladesh’s money, banks that had kept similar heists quiet have come forward: Just last week, it was revealed in a lawsuit that the Banco del Austro in Ecuador was targeted, as well.",Is North Korea Behind Bank Heists?
The economy. More people are flying. ,https://www.vox.com/2016/5/27/11790252/airport-security-lines-tsa,"Since March, the nation's biggest airports have been in the grips of a line apocalypse. Security lines have metastasized. What were once unusually long waits have become routine. Big airports are threatening to kick out the Transportation Security Administration and turn the security process back over to private contractors.

Watch the security line at DIA grow. From 4:30, to 5:00, to 5:45. Now it's almost to baggage claim @DenverChannel pic.twitter.com/r9sWcNrK0m — Jason Gruenauer (@JGonTV) May 26, 2016

The lines aren't invariably nightmarish at every airport, all day long. Still, many people, including me, have missed flights because they arrived at the airport at what used to be a reasonable time and found themselves still trapped in line as their flight took off.

The immediate reason for the long lines is pretty simple: Americans are flying more than ever, and the TSA hasn't grown quickly enough to keep up. But the current mess is also a direct result of the TSA's last crisis. Last fall, the agency got in trouble for not doing enough to keep weapons and explosives off planes, and stepped up security as a result.

The TSA has serious problems with culture and management, including disciplining whistleblowers who called out problems. But it's also stuck between a rock and a hard place, the victim of a political consensus that insists airport security must be perfectly airtight without ever being even the slightest bit inconvenient.

Lines are getting longer partly because more people are flying

In one sense, the long lines are good news: They're a sign of economic recovery as more people are flying.

The number of Americans flying dropped precipitously as the recession began, and didn't recover to its 2007 level until 2014. But over the past year and a half, many more people have been flying: Nearly 900 million people passed through American airports in 2015, up 5 percent from 2014. The number of people the TSA had to screen, since some of those passengers came from foreign airports, increased by 6 percent.

At the same time, airplane tickets have gotten cheaper as oil prices have fallen. The average domestic plane ticket cost $363 last year, down 8 percent from 2014. It was less expensive to fly in 2015 than in any year since 2010.

So far this year, both trends have continued. Overall passenger traffic increased 4 percent in January and 6 percent in February compared with 2014, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Some of the biggest airports — Denver, Los Angeles, New York's JFK, and San Francisco — have seen even bigger increases.

Fares, too, are continuing to fall. Hopper, an app that tracks airline ticket prices, is predicting the lowest summer airfares since 2009.

But more people flying also means more people in security lines. And TSA staffing hasn't kept up. There are 15 percent more people flying than in 2013, and the TSA has 12 percent fewer staff.

Congress isn't wholly to blame for the budget cuts. The Department of Homeland Security's own budget request for the 2016 fiscal year proposed cutting 1,666 screeners' jobs, saying that ""risk-based screening practices"" — such as getting people signed up for TSA's PreCheck program, which allows you access to expedited security if you pass a background check and pay $85 — were making checkpoints more efficient. The goal, the department wrote, was to ""continue transitioning to a smaller, more skilled, professional workforce.""

The agency now admits that this was a mistake, and is hiring 768 more screeners.

Some airports want to solve the problem by hiring contractors to handle security rather than the TSA, though it's not clear if that would make much of a difference. Some airports with privatized security still have passengers reporting long lines, including San Francisco International and Rochester, New York:

Lines weren't longer before because the TSA was sending people to expedited security

As airline passenger counts were reaching record-breaking levels in 2014, the TSA also started hurrying people through its expedited security lanes.

Since 2011, the TSA has offered PreCheck, which essentially offers pre-9/11 security for a price: Travelers at more than 150 airports keep their shoes and jackets on and their laptops and liquids in their bags, and they get to go through a regular metal detector rather than a body-scanning machine.

But initially the program didn't catch on as widely as the TSA hoped. Most Americans aren't frequent fliers, and the program cost $85. By late 2014, fewer than half a million people had signed up for PreCheck, the Wall Street Journal reported.

So in order to make sure the PreCheck lines were used, the TSA started routing regular passengers into them. In September 2013, just 10 percent of passengers got expedited screening — because they were over 70 or under 12, or because they were preapproved through PreCheck or Global Entry, a program focused on world travelers that allows them to get through customs more quickly.

Then in October 2013, the TSA expanded PreCheck to people who hadn't directly signed up for it, and the number of people getting expedited security immediately tripled.

There were a few ways to get PreCheck access without paying for it — you could be selected before arriving at the airport, based on the information you provide when you book your ticket, a program known as Secure Flight.

Or you could be routed into the PreCheck lanes at the airport once you were already there, a program known as ""managed inclusion."" The TSA would randomly assign people to either normal or expedited security lines. TSA officers observing travelers' behavior could pull you out of the expedited line, and explosives detection hand swab machines and dogs were supposed to add an additional layer of security.

The Government Accountability Office warned in March 2015 that these procedures hadn't been fully tested. Previous reports had suggested that the behavior detection officers aren't all that effective — a conclusion the TSA disagrees with. Still, at the time, the TSA was sending nearly half of all passengers to expedited screening, even though only about 7.2 million were actually qualified for PreCheck based on their background check, security clearance, or other factors:

Expediting the security lines sped up security and reduced the need for TSA screeners. But it also meant that security itself was less thorough. And if there's one thing the American people hate more than long security lines, it's the idea that a terrorist might be able to get a knife, gun, or bomb onto an airplane.

The TSA is trying to be less bad at its actual job: security

Then, starting last summer, a report from the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general concluded that the TSA was very, very bad at its actual job. Although the report was supposed to be classified, some damning details leaked: 95 percent of attempts to sneak prohibited items through security were successful.

The test results ""were disappointing and troubling,"" John Roth, the inspector general, said in congressional testimony in November. ""We found layers of security simply missing.""

Randomly choosing passengers for PreCheck took a lot of heat. Congressional hearings featured one whistleblower who said the TSA was ""handing out PreCheck status like Halloween candy.""

So in response, the TSA clamped down on security. It was obvious that this would lead to longer security waits, as Jason Edward Harrington, a former TSA employee, wrote for the Guardian in June 2015:

The greatest challenge when it comes to such failures stems from the fundamental catch-22 of the TSA’s mission: if agents properly execute their duties, then internal testing results will improve and airplanes might be slightly safer. But meticulous adherence to the TSA’s standard of practice will mean lines that back up to the ticketing counters. Flights will be missed due to the enormous security delays, and the distended passenger lines themselves will become choice terrorist targets. It’s a classic quantity-versus-quality dilemma.

In October 2015, the TSA discontinued managed inclusion, the program that sends travelers into PreCheck lines at the airport and monitors them with behavior officers and explosive trace detectors.

Starting last fall, the TSA and some reporters warned that lines were going to get longer. Washington, DC's airports noticed the change almost immediately, the Washington Post reported.

""I knew that would dramatically increase the number of people in the standard lanes,"" Peter Neffenger, the administration's head, said at congressional hearings this week. But the TSA had planned its budget assuming the expedited screening was going to continue.

Since the uproar began about the long lines, Neffenger said the agency is holding daily calls with the busiest airports and has established a national command center to monitor security wait times. And some travelers still manage to breeze through the lines with no trouble:

One week ago: 1+ hour waits @ATLairport but now NO LINE for main security checkpoint pic.twitter.com/OOvPvW2Sux — Steve Gehlbach (@SteveGWSB) May 23, 2016

But as long as Americans insist that airport security be flawless, cheap, and fast, the seesawing between outrage that the TSA is too slow and that the TSA isn't doing enough is likely to continue.

Kavya, the 2009 Scripps National Spelling Bee champion, is a spelling superstar complete with signature move: She air-writes each word across her palm before speaking it. Kavya and Mirle—her innovative, ever-enthusiastic coach—were at the small-time competition to pay homage. Over the past two decades, tournaments like this one—a regional qualifier for the North South Foundation’s spelling league—have become a breeding ground for Scripps contenders. These minor-league competitions help kids as young as 6 years old work out the spelling kinks at an early age. The result has been an Indian-American dynasty at the National Spelling Bee.

Consider the facts: Indian-Americans make up about 1 percent of the U.S. population; this year, an estimated 30 NSF-ers will compete at Scripps, 11 percent of the 273-kid field. Recent winners include Sai R. Gunturi from Dallas, who nonchalantly reassembled pococurante for a national title in 2003. Sameer Mishra from West Lafayette, Ind., nailed guerdon in 2008. And four-time finalist Shivashankar made it back-to-back titles for North South Foundation competitors last year, air-writing Laodicean for the win. If Shivashankar hadn’t come through, it’s possible another North South graduate would have: Four other NSF kids cracked the top 10 behind her.

The NSF circuit consists of 75 chapters run by close to 1,000 volunteers. The competitions, which began in 1993, function as a nerd Olympiad for Indian-Americans—there are separate divisions for math, science, vocab, geography, essay writing, and even public speaking—and a way to raise money for college scholarships for underprivileged students in India. There is little financial reward for winners (just a few thousand dollars in college scholarships) compared with the $40,000 winning purse handed out each year by Scripps. Still, more than 3,000 kids participated in NSF’s spelling events this year due in part to what NSF founder Ratnam Chitturi calls a sort of Kavya Effect. “Most American kids look up to sports figures,” he says. “Indian kids are more interested in education, and they finally have a role model.”

Just as Kavya Shivashankar has inspired the next wave of Indian spellers, Kavya found her bee mojo during the post- Spellbound boom. Before Spellbound, the 2002 documentary that featured Indian-American Nupur Lala’s run to the 1999 Scripps title, many first-generation South Asian parents saw NSF as a way for their children to assimilate—the best way to understand a culture, after all, is to learn its language. They used the North South Foundation events as a sort of SAT prep, teaching their children to use phonetics, etymology, and word roots to suss out answers. “Our focus is not on competition,” says Chitturi. “Winning becomes an outcome of you focusing on learning. You are competing against yourself, not these other people.”

After Spellbound, that changed a bit. After Balu Natarajan (winning word: milieu) became the first Indian-American to win Scripps back in 1985, he went on to a career in sports medicine. When Lala did it in 1999 with logorrhea, she became a movie star. (OK, a movie star and a neuroscientist.) Kavya has called Lala an inspiration—the license plate of Mirle’s teal minivan reads “SPL BND.” She’s far from alone. In 2002, NSF had less than 20 chapters pulling in about 500 mostly middle-school-age spellers. Then pop culture galvanized an expansion to elementary schoolers; today, six times as many students compete in North South Foundation spelling events. “The parents were just excited,” Chitturi says. “They saw that it was a possibility [to win the National Spelling Bee].”

It’s no coincidence, then, that in the last decade North South Foundation has transformed from an SAT prep course into a training ground for Scripps. It wasn’t too long ago that NSF standouts like Kamran Riaz and 2000 champion Ashley Thakur didn’t compete at the National Spelling Bee. Riaz, for one, remembers NSF as a nice “alternative” to Scripps. Thakur’s thoughts on the National Spelling Bee: “Not to brag, but I don’t think it would be a hard cake to cut,” she once bragged to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

It’s not quite right to say that Riaz and Thakur didn’t go to nationals because they didn’t think it was a big deal. The more significant reason is that they simply weren’t eligible. You have to be more than a great speller to qualify for the National Bee—you also have to live in a school district with a sponsoring newspaper or community organization. These days, parents seem to be paying a lot more attention to such logistics. When Mirle Shivashankar realized in 2005 that there was just one Scripps sponsor in all of Kansas, he beat the bushes to ensure that more kids from the state—his daughter, for one—would have the chance to go to nationals. Kavya subsequently gained all of her berths to the nationals by virtue of a brand-new sponsor, the Olathe News.

The North South Foundation could dominate Scripps even further, if more of its spellers were eligible to compete. In areas with more gifted NSFers than competition zones, the battle to get into Scripps can be intense. Whereas regional North South Foundation competitions are run like standardized tests—the best scores get weighted against a national average to determine the national finalists—Scripps operates more like a crazy single-elimination tournament. The winner in each local bracket funnels into a pool of finalists, who repeat the same process to pick a winner. That can lead to some powerhouse regional showdowns. In San Jose, Calif., for instance, eventual 2009 NSF senior co-champion Ramya Auroprem had to beat out 2009 NSF runner-up Sidarth Jayadev just to make it into last year’s National Spelling Bee finals.

North South Foundation winners don’t have to worry about Kavya Shivashankar anymore—she has retired. At the Shawnee NSF contest this April, Swetha Jasti placed first, with a perfect score that qualified her for NSF nationals later this summer. But unfortunately for Jasti, she won’t make it to Scripps this year. When the National Spelling Bee starts up this week, their region will be represented by a surprise challenger: Kavya’s 8-year-old sister, Vanya, who drubbed Jasti in the National Spelling Bee’s Olathe qualifier.

For youngsters like Vanya, this is Scripps’ best selling point: Whereas the North South Foundation still divides contestants into junior and senior levels, the National Spelling Bee has no minimum age requirement. Vanya, who has taken to referring to herself and her sister as the Eli and Peyton Manning of spelling, will be the youngest competitor in Washington, D.C., this year. When ESPN recently showed up in Kansas to film a miniprofile for the contest, she grinned unabashedly. “Now it’s my turn,” she proclaimed to the room full of cameras. As with most things in the life of an NSF standout, the moment seemed well-rehearsed.



",Why Are Indian Kids So Good at Spelling?
"Children's ""Safe Space/Classrooms"". ",https://www.devp.org/en/blog/youll-never-guess-whats-inside-tent,"Upon my recent visit to Iraq, I saw the intense psychological distress that over 500,000 Iraqi Yazidis1 experience every day. They have had to abandon their houses and families in order to o survive the violence of the armed group calling itself the Islamic State, who’s made lightning-fast advances throughout the country.

All of them suffered the horrors of war in some way, and many of them are still plagued by the effects of post-traumatic stress. The vast majority of the victims are under 18.

Young Yazidi in the Dahuk region of northern Iraq

What can we do for these uprooted youths, forced to live far from their homes in camps or makeshift shelters? What happens when the closest school is four hours away on foot and so overcrowded it cannot accept any new students?

This is why for the last few months Development and Peace, in partnership with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD), has been involved in a project to create youth centres that provide these kids in dire need with a safe space.

This tent lets 240 children learn in a fun environment and helps them return to a normal routine.

Thanks to our project, over 900 children have access, twice a week, to a tent, the inside of which resembles a classroom.

On site, an intervention team offers children a variety of activities and a positive environment in which they can feel safe. Women account for at least 50% of each team, as children are more likely to confide their psychological distress to a woman. Furthermore, some of the staff hired to run these centres are displaced people, in an effort to provide them and their families with extra income.



The tents’ interior looks like a classroom, and fun and educational activities are offered to the children.

Priority activities

Thanks to our partners’ experience with other displaced populations, and after consulting the target population during the analysis phase of the project, it was decided to offer five types of activities in the centres:

Recreational games for children;

Informal education, by age group, with an emphasis on building vocabulary;

Team-spirit building activities;

Peaceful conflict-resolution activities; and

Activities in which children can talk about the stress they’ve experienced.

Colouring activity in the village of Shaekadry’s youth centre (Iraqi Kurdistan)

These spaces are also used by the staff to assess the wellbeing of the children, and ensure that they receive the psychological care they might require. Already, close to 50 children have been diagnosed with severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and have been referred to a specialist who will be able to give them proper care.



These centres are not meant to replace real schools, but in a context of mass displacement and overcrowded classrooms, they ensure that children can continue their education while on the waiting list to enroll permanently in a local school. Without this interim program, a whole generation might struggle with learning issues and face a bleak future.

It is not too late to make a donation and help more children gain access to these centres.



Here are a few children I had the privilege of meeting:





Sonja, age 15, wants to learn Arabic and English.

Lisa, age 11, thanks us for creating this centre. She likes the activities offered, but wishes she could take Arabic lessons.

Shamo, age 12, loves it when we teach him some English words.

Randy, age 12, is grateful when teachers manage to make him forget “the things he’s seen” and hopes to become an engineer.

$14 Billion last year. ,http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/26/you-wont-believe-how-much-banks-make-in-overdraft.aspx,"The bank overdraft fee seems a bit like the financial equivalent of kicking a man when he's down. Having to pay $35 or so because you don't have enough money to cover a check you wrote is like having life hand you lemons -- and then squirt lemon juice in your eye.

Basically, the overdraft and its cousin, the fee for insufficient funds, amount to a further tax on people who are already not doing so well. To make matters worse, in many cases overdraft fees can set off a cascade of unexpected bad checks for people operating on a tight budget. That can turn a $35 problem into something much bigger, according to the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL), which just released a research report entitled ""Broken Banking: How Overdraft Fees Harm Consumers and Discourage Responsible Bank Products.""

In the report, which examined data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, CRL essentially found that overdraft fees were too lucrative for banks to consider giving them up. Even if they want to reform -- and some banks have made changes to certain accounts -- it's hard to walk away from the $14 billion in overdraft fees ($17 billion when you add in charges for insufficient funds) American banks generated last year, according to CRL.

""CRL's analysis confirms that overdraft abuses continue, carrying an enormous annual price tag for consumers as a whole, and with devastating effects on individuals,"" said Peter Smith, a senior researcher at CRL and the report's co-author in a press release.

Is the number really that high?

In the first three months of 2015 the three biggest banks in the United States -- JPMporgan Chase ( JPM -1.18% ), Bank of America ( BAC -0.90% ), and Wells Fargo ( WFC -0.30% ) -- made $1.1 billion in overdraft fees, CNN Money reported. That projects out to $4.5 billion in 2015, or $20 for every America adult, reported the website.

For the big banks, however, overdraft fees represent only a small percentage of total revenue. Even though the totals add up to astounding numbers, overdraft fees accounted for less than 6% of non-interest revenue at JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, according to a report by SNL Financial.

Smaller banks, the study found, can make much more than the overall median of 8% non-interest revenue. Woodforest National Bank, which had over 750 branches in 17 states, and First National, which operated just under 300 locations, made more than 40% of their of non-interest revenue from overdraft charges at the time of the study, according to SNL Financial.

""These banks are highly reliant on these charges,"" says Tyler Hall, a senior bank analyst at SNL Financial. ""It just points out that's their business model.""

Altogether, in the first three months of 2015, the nearly 600 banks that reported overdraft fees took in $2.5 billion in overdraft fees -- not quite as much as CRL projects, but not so far off as to make its report invalid.

How does this happen?

For consumers with low balances, an unexpected overdraft fee dig a hole that's hard to get out of. CRL explained the process in its press release.

Frequently marketed as a 'customer service', overdraft fees are incurred when a bank account lacks sufficient funds to cover a transaction and the institution pays the transaction anyway. The institution then repays itself the value of the overdraft transactions, and all accompanying fees, from the account holder's next incoming deposit.

Debit card payments and paper check payments alike can result in overage fees, which average $35, but that may only be the start of the problem. ""If time lags before the account is replenished, the institution may charge additional 'sustained' overdraft fees, and a bank is also able to charge for multiple overdrafts before the account is replenished,"" according to the CRL report.

""Financial institutions take advantage of consumers fighting desperately to stay afloat,"" said Rebecca Borné, report co-author and CRL senior policy counsel. ""CFPB should require that overdraft fees be reasonable and proportional to the cost to the institution, much the same way that credit card penalty fees are regulated. Overdraft fees should also be limited to one per month and six per year.""

What happens next?

Many of the smaller banks make so much money on overdraft fees that they have little incentive to reform. The larger banks like JPMporgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, however, could in theory spur a change, given that they don't rely on overdraft fees for much of their revenue.

One simple way to reform these practices, according to CRL, would simply be to deny charges when consumers do not have the funds in their account to pay for them. That would stop the chain dead before it has a chance to snowball on the consumer, and it would stop the banks from offering unregulated de facto credit products to consumers who can't afford them.",You Won't Believe How Much Banks Make in Overdraft Fees

69% more for out-of-pocket health care costs than men. ,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/women-pay-more-healthcare,"When it comes to healthcare, being a woman means you'll have some extra, shall we say, considerations. Shouldering the brunt of the birth control burden, making regular trips to the gyno for screenings, and, oh yeah, that whole political firestorm surrounding a woman’s right to access certain types of healthcare are just a few of the things that women have to factor into their decisions.

But according to new data from healthcare company Vitals, women have one more thing to worry about: disproportionate costs.

On average, women pay 69 percent more for out-of-pocket healthcare costs than men.

Vitals

Although groan-inducing, the numbers aren’t that surprising. The bills for standard preventative care, breast and ovarian cancer screenings, and birth control—not to mention being actually, you know, sick—aren’t cheap. The costs add up.

Sign up for Women's Health's new newsletter, So This Happened, to get the day’s trending stories and health studies.

According to the data from Vitals, women can expect to shell out some serious cash for the health issues we encounter over a lifetime. One in four women will have her tubes tied, which can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $6,000. And women are four to six times more likely than men to have knee pain, which can mean a $65,000 knee replacement. Even barring any of these major expenses, regular old mammograms can run up to $200 a pop. Not cool.

Time to start thinking about making healthcare costs a bigger line item in your long-term budget.

No. ,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/10/9886152/donald-trump-fascism,"Is Donald Trump a fascist?

That question emerged in various forms pretty early in his 2016 presidential campaign, which began with a speech railing against Mexican immigrants, and gained steam after he called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” in December 2015, as a response to the San Bernardino terrorist attack.

At that point, the Muslim ban proposal, I contacted five fascism experts and asked them if Trump qualified. They all said no. Every one of them stated that to be a fascist, one must support the revolutionary, usually violent overthrow of the entire government/Constitution, and reject democracy entirely. In 2015, none were comfortable saying Trump went that far. He was too individualist for the inherently collectivist philosophy of fascism, and not sufficiently committed to the belief that violence is good for its own sake, as a vital cleansing force.

Roger Griffin, the author of The Nature of Fascism and a professor of history at Oxford Brookes University, summed it up well: “You can be a total xenophobic racist male chauvinist bastard and still not be a fascist.”

Five years have now passed, and the fascism questions have only grown more frequent. Trump has had time to implement quite anti-immigrant and anti-Black policies, and refused to denounce his most extreme and violent supporters, from the neo-Nazis and white nationalists in Charlottesville to the Proud Boys group. And every week, I receive dozens of emails from readers wondering if I stand by my conclusion in 2015, that Trump is simply a bigot with an authoritarian streak, not a fascist.

So I reached out to the experts I talked to back then. Four of the five replied, and I also got in touch with a few more scholars who have researched fascism to get a broader view.

The responses were, again, unanimous, albeit tinged with much greater concern about Trump’s authoritarian and violent tendencies. No one thinks Trump is a fascist leader, full stop. Jason Stanley, a Yale philosopher and author of How Fascism Works, came closest to that conclusion, saying that “you could call legitimately call Trumpism a fascist social and political movement” and that Trump is “using fascist political tactics,” but that Trump isn’t necessarily leading a fascist government.

But most experts did not even go that far, and some expressed concern that describing Trump as a fascist undermines the term and leads to a misanalysis of our current political situation. “If Trump was a fascist and we were in a situation akin to Germany in 1932 or Italy in 1921, certain kinds of actions would be justified,” Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, says. “But we are not and they are not.”

To be clear, “not fascist” is a very, very low bar for Trump to clear. The concerns that lead people to ask the question “Is Trump a fascist?” are real. Trump really is trying to discredit the coming presidential election. He really has hired officials with ties to white nationalist groups. He really did promise to ban all Muslims from the US (and implemented new rules toward that goal), said that a Mexican American judge is unfit to preside over cases involving him, called Mexican immigrants “rapists,” empathized with neo-Nazis after Charlottesville, and falsely claimed Muslim Americans celebrated the 9/11 attacks — among many, many transgressions.

But things could always get worse. There really are leaders who suspend elections, dissolve legislatures, throw large numbers of citizens into camps without trial or appeal, who turn their nations into one-party states oriented around a cult of national rebirth. The fascist leaders of the past, the University of Texas’s Jason Brownlee notes, “not only pursued right-wing policies, they also built-up mass-mobilizing parties and paramilitary organizations with the goal of sweeping aside alternative movements and establishing single-party dictatorship.”

That hasn’t happened here — but it could. It came terrifyingly close to happening in Greece, where the explicitly neo-Nazi Golden Dawn became the third-largest political party in the mid-2010s. And if and when it does happen in America, we need to have the right terms and tools to confront it.

Robert Paxton, Mellon professor emeritus of social sciences, Columbia University

I stand by what I have already written about Trump and fascism, but there is one change: I am struck now with Trump’s growing willingness to employ physical violence.

Before, Trump was already willing to tolerate some roughing-up of hecklers at rallies, and his encouragement of the “lock her up!” refrain was clearly transgressive (in America we are supposed to wait for the decision of a jury of citizens before locking someone up). But now, after Charlottesville, we have the Proud Boys and the aggression against the governor of Michigan. So Trump gets closer to having his own SA [the Nazi paramilitary group], a sobering thought as the election approaches.

But there is still no state management of the economy here (as there was to a degree in Nazi Germany and fascist Italy). Trump is content to aid business by reducing government protections of the environment and of workers … and his economic policy is mainly just to let businessmen do what they want, So I still think terms like “oligarchy” and “plutocracy” work for Trump, with the added thought that he is close to crossing the line with his toleration of violence.

Matthew Feldman, director, Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right

Although my position has not changed on Trump — less fascist than kleptocrat, more egoist than radical-right ideologue — that does little to mitigate the danger.

Four months ago, I warned that Trump was descending into naked authoritarianism. Low-information commentators seek to reassure rather than dig deeply, telling readers to look on the bright side. That the US is an exceptional country.

It is not.

Democratic regression and political polarization are not unique to the US. Having more guns than people is. So are militias, usually formed of lower- and middle-class white Americans harboring anti-government sentiments. The threat posed by these anti-government extremists — though not necessarily terrorists — was thrown into relief when at least 13 members of Michigan’s Wolverine Militia were arrested for planning to kidnap, “judge,” and potentially execute for treason the state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer.

The term “fascist” regarding Trump continues to mislead rather than inform. But that cannot inure us to what Alexander Reid Ross has called the “fascist creep.”

Stanley Payne, Jaume Vicens Vives and Hilldale professor emeritus of history, the University of Wisconsin Madison

This inquiry made a little sense four years ago, when Trump was still an unknown quantity, but now he has a record. Well — that’s pretty thin gruel. Nothing much to work with here. The Democrats won the first election under Trump [the 2018 midterms], and I’m not aware of anything negative happening. Straining at gnats doesn’t really get us anywhere. Mostly these are just silly public remarks. Hitler’s place in history is not based on his remarks, nor for any temporary detention cages. Please do not trivialize. That indicates absence of an argument.

Roger Griffin, emeritus professor in modern history, Oxford Brookes University

His relationship to democracy, I would really insist, is the key to answering whether he’s a fascist or not. Even in four years of incoherent and inconsistent tweets, he’s never actually done a Putin and tried to make himself a permanent president, let alone suggest any coherent plan for overthrowing the constitutional system. And I don’t even think that’s in his mind. He is an exploiter, he’s a freeloader. He’s a wheeler and dealer. And that is not the same as an ideologue.

So he’s absolutely not a fascist. He does not pose a challenge to constitutional democracy. He certainly poses a great challenge to liberalism and liberal democracy. And I think real favor will be served by journalists who, instead of seeing liberal democracy as a single entity, see it as a binomial. Democracy can exist without liberalism.

If I was doing this as a bottom line in some debate, I’d say that Trump is not a fascist, but what he is quite consistently is an illiberal democrat. He is a democrat to the extent that he’s used democratic processes to be where he is, which he doesn’t radically challenge. He obviously plays fast and loose, like any wheeler dealer, with things like the Supreme Court, who he gets in, etc. He doesn’t care about the rules, but the core system he doesn’t want to change, because he’s somebody who’s profited by that system.

Basically, I think it matters whether we call Trump fascist or not fascist, not academically or intellectually, but because it’s a red herring — it actually diverts attention from where we should be doing the critique. If all our intellectual energies are, like Don Quixote, jousting with windmills and fascism, instead of actually jousting with the real enemies of democracy, and using our energies to avert the climate crisis, which is going to engulf us all, if we’re not careful, then we’re wasting our time.

By not calling him fascist, and concentrating on the way he perverts democracy, we see Trump in a different context. We don’t see him as Hitler or Mussolini. We see him in a different rogues’ gallery. And the rogues’ gallery is made up of a whole load of dictators throughout history, including Putin and Erdogan and Orbán and Assad today, who have abused constitutionalism and democracy to rationalize their abuse of power and their crimes against humanity.

Sheri Berman, professor of political science, Barnard College, Columbia University

On Trump and fascism, unlike what has become an almost majority view, I do not like applying that term to Trump or to what is going on in this country.

Partially this is for historical and intellectual reasons — just like we shouldn’t call every horrible example of ethnic violence or even ethnic cleansing “genocide” (or say that it is another Holocaust), so I think we should be careful with comparing Trump to Hitler. Genocide means something: It is an attempt to wipe out an entire people, using the full force of the modern state. Similarly, national socialism or, more broadly, fascism was a totalitarian ideology and political regime that wanted to do away not only with liberalism and democracy but to revolutionize society, economy, and politics. That’s not the same as any old dictatorship, even a nasty one, and that is not where we are today.

That said, just as ethnically based violence or ethnic cleansing shares some characteristics with genocide/the Holocaust, so too does Trump bear similarities to other strongmen, a category in which fascists like Hitler and Mussolini belong, as do Orbán, Erdogan, Putin, and their ilk. That Trump maintains his support by engaging in explicitly divisive appeals designed to pit groups against each other — particularly but not exclusively ethnic groups — also, of course, bears some similarity to what fascists did.

And, of course, Trump is undermining various norms and institutions of democracy. But this doesn’t make him a fascist, which means much more than these things. Indeed, I almost think calling Trump “fascist” gives him too much “credit” — he isn’t strategic enough, ideological enough, or ambitious enough. And as bad as things are today, we are still not in 1930s Germany.

But alongside these historical and intellectual reasons, I also don’t like applying the term fascist to Trump for practical reasons. If Trump was a fascist and we were in a situation akin to Germany in 1932 or Italy in 1921, certain kinds of actions would be justified. But we are not, and they are not. And that remains important to stress, even though that does not mean downplaying the real threat Trump and the version of the Republican Party that is backing him represents to our country.

I think Trump often engages in what the political science literature refers to as “ethnic outbidding.” Even more fitting, in my view, is the term “negative integration” — a strategy of unifying a coalition by whipping up fear/hatred of purported enemies. Bismarck was the classic practitioner of the negative integration strategy.

As for Trump overall, I would still prefer referring to him as an illiberal populist or right-wing populist. He has a lot in common with the right-wing populists roaming around Europe today.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, professor of Italian and history, New York University

Trump certainly uses fascist tactics, from holding rallies to refresh the leader-follower bond to creating a “tribe” (MAGA hats, rituals like chanting “lock them up,” etc.) to unleashing a volume of propaganda without precedent by an American president. Yet the political cultures that form him and his close supporters are not fascist, but reflect a broader authoritarian history. Paul Manafort and Roger Stone worked for [Congolese dictator] Mobutu Sese Seko and [Philippine President] Ferdinand Marcos before Trump, and Manafort also worked for Putin. They worked on Marcos’s 1986 election that was widely denounced as fraudulent.

Trump’s role models include leaders like Erdogan and Putin who are not exactly fascists, but something more: authoritarians, or strongman rulers who also use virility as a tool of domination.

I also favor authoritarian over fascist as a description for Trump because the former captures how autocratic power works today. In the 21st century, fascist takeovers have been replaced by rulers who come to power through elections and then, over time, extinguish freedom.

Jason Brownlee, professor of government, the University of Texas at Austin

Of course Trump’s detractors are free to use whatever terms and epithets they like.

I would not say the traditional idea of fascism fits Donald Trump in 2020 any more than it did before he took office. When historians and political scientists do a full accounting of his actions and statements as president, I do not think fascism will figure prominently in their analyses. The prototypical fascist leaders — Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, [Austrian Chancellor] Engelbert Dollfuss — not only pursued right-wing policies, they also built-up mass-mobilizing parties and paramilitary organizations with the goal of sweeping aside alternative movements and establishing single-party dictatorship. I would tend to describe Trump’s brand of politics differently, and I would place him in different company.

Trump is a celebrity-turned-right-wing politician. He acts as a consummate demagogue, fabulist, and ultranationalist, and he appears to have a strong inclination for nepotism and kleptocracy. His efforts to use the presidency to finance his lifestyle and enrich his family resemble the schemes of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. In addition to profiting from his time in office, Trump, like Marcos, has challenged constraints on executive authority without investing resources into a sustainable political organization.

In other respects, Trump’s style of politics recalls portions of the career of former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Like Milošević, Trump has promoted a very hierarchical, ethnically based ultranationalist vision that endorses violence against out-groups but without building up a single party the way interwar fascists did.

Jason Stanley, Jacob Urowsky professor of philosophy, Yale University

When I think about fascism, I think about it as applied to different things. There’s a fascist regime. We do not have a fascist regime. Then there’s the question of, “Is Trumpism a fascist social and political movement?” I think you could call legitimately call Trumpism a fascist social and political movement — which is not to say that Trump is a fascist. Trumpism involves a cult of the leader, and Trump embodies that. I certainly think he’s using fascist political tactics. I think there’s no question about that. He is calling for national restoration in the face of humiliations brought on by immigrants, liberals, liberal minorities, and leftists. He’s certainly playing the fascist playbook.

My definition is of fascist politics, not of a fascist regime. I think most of the other [fascism scholars] are just talking about something else. They’re talking about regimes. Toni Morrison in 1995 said the United States has long favored fascist solutions to national problems. Toni Morrison is talking about “fascist solutions.” She’s not talking about fascist regimes. She’s saying the United States has long favored fascist solutions in a democratic state, which I completely agree with: targeting minorities, mass incarceration, colonialism, seizing indigenous land. All these things are things that impacted Hitler. My work is based in the United States — it’s based in the movements that affected European fascism: the KKK, Jim Crow, the anti-miscegenation law, slavery, Indigenous genocide, the 1924 Immigration Act and similar US immigration laws that Hitler lauds in Mein Kampf.

If you’re only worried about fascist regimes, you’re never going to catch fascist social and political movements. The goal is to catch fascist social and political movements, and fascist ideology, before it becomes a regime.",Is Trump a fascist? 8 experts weigh in.
To satisfy the demand for seafood. ,http://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/appetite-for-fish-is-turning-the-ocean-into-a-floating-pig-farm/,"Let’s face it, most people are entirely unaware of the methods used to produce the food they eat every day. There might be a sort of idyllic image of farm involved somewhere, but by and large, the reality of how food – especially meat, dairy, eggs, and fish – gets to the table is shrouded in mystery. Awareness of the type of facilities where animals are raised is increasing, as more consumers actively seek out labels like “pasture-raised” and “cage-free” thinking they are in some way superior. But in the case of fish, things are a little less clear.

In recent years, wild-caught and farm-raised has become a distinction between various types of fish found in the grocery store, but can most frequently be seen attached to salmon. The average American consumes two pounds of salmon a year, around two-thirds of which comes from farmed sources in China, Norway, and Canada. While wild-caught is largely self-explanatory, what exactly does farm-raised mean in the context of fish, mainly salmon?

Floating Farms

Around 40 percent of all fish consumed annually, are raised on aquafarms which can either be land-based or ocean-based. Land-based farms raise thousands of fish in ponds, pools, or even concrete tanks, where ocean-based aquafarms house fish in isolated cages either off-shore or in the open water.

In both cases, fish are overstocked and have little space to swim or display their natural behaviors, creating an extremely stressful environment. Around 40 percent of aquafarmed fish will die before they are harvested. And with good reason. Stocking thousands of fish in a small amount of space and feeding them protein pellets (ironically made from other fish) doused with antibiotics and chemicals, such as PCB, understandably makes for highly polluted water. If you’ve ever had a fish and seen what it looks like when you forget to clean their tanks for a few weeks … you can start to fathom the idea.

"No, it's safer than ever. ",http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/20/aviation/air-travel-safety/index.html,"(CNN) — As officials continue to investigate what happened to EgyptAir Flight 804, many travelers can't help but question the risks they face when boarding their next flight.

Is it becoming unsafe to fly?

Just the opposite, say analysts.

As we move towards the second half of 2016, it's shaping out to be one of the safest years in recent aviation history.

""We are ahead of the 10-year average with eight accidents and 167 fatalities compared to the average of 10 accidents and 205 fatalities,"" aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas, editor of Airlineratings.com , told CNN.

Analyzing the data

Experts say measuring the number of crashes or deaths alone isn't an accurate way to determine safety. You also have to factor in the overall amount of aviation traffic.

According to data released by the International Air Transport Association , more than 3.5 billion people flew safely on 37.6 million flights (31.4 million by jet, 6.2 million by turboprop) in 2015.

In a report released earlier this year, AirlineRatings.com said that 2015 was a safer year for aviation than the previous 12 months.

It cites Aviation-Safety.net data that tallies 16 air accidents with 560 fatalities -- below the 10-year average and an improvement on 2014 when there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities.

""Flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5% of today's number,"" said the report.

There were two high-profile air travel incidents in 2015.

In March, an Airbus A320-211 operated by budget carrier Germanwings crashed into the French Alps killing all 150 people on board.

It later transpired that pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was identified as having suicidal tendencies, had caused the crash deliberately.

In October, 224 people were killed when a Russian Metrojet Airbus A321-231 broke apart shortly after takeoff from Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport in Egypt.

The disaster was claimed as a bomb attack by terror group ISIS. Investigations are still ongoing, but initial intelligence reports also pointed the finger at terrorism.

Ranking airline safety

Every year, AirlineRatings.com puts out a list of the world's safest airlines

The rating system takes into account audits from aviation's governing bodies and lead associations, as well as government audits and the airlines' fatality records.

It also examines airlines' operational histories, incident records and operational excellence.

According to the site, 148 of the 407 airlines it surveyed have the top seven-star safety ranking, but almost 50 have just three stars or less.

If an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and/or crew members it will automatically lose a star from its safety-rating rankings.

EgyptAir has a product safety rating of 5/7.",Is flying more dangerous than ever?
Louisiana ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/05/21/this-state-is-about-to-become-the-first-where-targeting-police-is-a-hate-crime/,"The Louisiana legislation has been referred to as “Blue Lives Matter” — a phrase popularized in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, which exploded following the fatal 2014 police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo.

Black Lives Matter activists have protested what they deem as excessive force by police, and they have called attention to specific instances in which police shot unarmed civilians.

But those who respond with “Blue Lives Matter” argue it’s officers who are under assault — that criticism of police fosters animosity toward law enforcement. In Louisiana, there were eight line-of-duty deaths among law-enforcement officers in 2015, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.

Louisiana House Bill 953 faced little opposition from lawmakers; the House passed it 91 to 0, and the state Senate approved it 33 to 3. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), the son of a sheriff who has indicated that he plans to sign HB 953 into law.

Some states have floated proposals similar to the Louisiana legislation, and a bill proposed in Congress would amend federal hate-crime law to include officers as a protected class.

“Talking heads on television and inflammatory rhetoric on social media are inciting acts of hatred and violence toward our nation’s peace officers,” Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said in a statement. “Our members are increasingly under fire by individuals motivated by nothing more than a desire to kill or injure a cop.”

In 2015, 124 officers died in the line of duty, according to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund. The number of officers fatally shot declined, falling to 42 from 49 a year earlier, while the overall number of deaths increased because of more traffic accidents and job-related illnesses.Fatal shootings of officers has decreased over the previous few decades — from an average of 127 in the 1970s to 57 yearly between 2000 and 2009.

But many officers and their relatives have said they feel greater tension with the increased attention to fatal shootings by police.

Louisiana state Rep. Lance Harris (R), who authored the hate-crime bill, has pointed to high-profile cases in arguing for his bill.

According to the Advocate, Louisiana’s largest daily newspaper, Harris cited the brazen and deadly ambush of two New York police officers in December of 2014 and a drive-by shooting that wounded a firefighter that same month in Florida.

“We have a pretty extensive hate-crime law right now, but I believe we should add firefighters and policemen,” Harris said, according to the Advocate.

No other state includes police officers as a protected class under hate-crime laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But at least 37 states — including Louisiana — have enhanced penalties for assaulting police officers.

In some states, hurting a police officer can be an “aggravating factor” to an assault or battery charge. And in many states, killing a police officer can be an aggravating factor or circumstance, making it a crime eligible for the death penalty.

Edwards, the Louisiana governor, is expected to sign the “Blue Lives Matter” bill this week.

According to the Advertiser, the Edwards family “has produced four generations of Tangipahoa Parish sheriffs,” including current Sheriff Daniel Edward, the governor’s brother.

“As the son and brother of a sheriff, I have the greatest respect for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect our communities, state and nation,” Edwards said in a statement. “Police officers and firefighters often perform life-saving acts of heroism, oftentimes under very dangerous circumstances, and are integral in maintaining order and civility in our society.

“The members of the law enforcement community deserve these protections, and I look forward to signing this bill into law.”

There has been criticism of the measure outside of the state Capitol. The New Orleans chapter of activist group Black Youth Project 100 has called on Edwards to veto HB 953, arguing that citizens, not police, are under assault.

“By treating the police as specialized citizens held above criticism and the laws they are charged to enforce, we lose our ability to exercise our First Amendment right,” the organization said in a statement. “Including ‘police’ as a protected class in hate crime legislation would serve to provide more protection to an institution that is statistically proven to be racist in action, policy, and impact.”

The organization highlighted high-profile deaths of civilians in Louisiana, including that of a handcuffed Victor White III. Officials in 2014 said the 22-year-old shot himself with a gun while in the back seat of an Iberia Parish sheriff’s deputy’s car.

The regional director of the Anti-Defamation League said it’s not wise to add occupations to hate-crime protected classes. “It’s really focused on immutable characteristics,” Allison Goodman told the Advocate. “Proving the bias intent for a hate crime for law enforcement or first responders is very different than proving it for someone who is Jewish or gay or black.”

The change to Louisiana law would mean those convicted of committing felony hate crimes against police officers could face a maximum fine of $5,000 or a five-year prison sentence.

Antibiotics resistance. ,http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/antibiotics-will-soon-stop-working-and-make-chemotherapy-too-dangerous-to-be-performed-major-report-a7036776.html,"Urgent action is needed to control the use of antibiotics before they cease to work, leaving a number of major conditions untreatable and causing “terrible human and economic cost”, a major study has warned.

Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report’s authors warn.

Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called ‘superbugs’ such as MRSA develop.

Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further. In the UK, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock.

The report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former Goldman Sachs Asset Managemet chairman Lord Jim O’Neill. The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK.

Lord O'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is 'absolutely essential' (PA)

It calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: “to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.” Among his recommendations, Lord O’Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use.

The report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050.

✕ Antibiotics crisis is global

Lord O’Neill said of the findings: “My review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. The actions I’m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now… to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face.”

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the report’s recommendations, saying: “Lord O’Neill’s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is. It is not just a threat to health but also to the world economy. Apart from the moral case for action, the economic cost of failing to act is too great to contemplate.”

Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, who previously warned that the UK is facing an “apocalyptic scenario” over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as “challenging.”

Antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, stopping infections. They transformed medicine when they were first used early last century and have contributed to the near eradication of a number of serious conditions including tuberculosis and syphilis. An estimated 40 million antibiotics are prescribed in the UK every year, of which the health regulator Nice claims 10 million are unnecessary prescriptions.","Antibiotics will stop working at a 'terrible human cost', major report warns"

Although there has been a trend over the last few decades of the spring allergy season inching up on the calendar, Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York and an ambassador for AAFA, told weather.com that the presence of El Niño this winter and the wet, mild winter weather much of the country saw can result in a stronger allergy season.

""In any year with an El Niño phenomenon, we expect certain areas of the country, particularly in the South, to be plagued by lots of rainfall and precipitation,"" Dr. Clifford Bassett said. ""Each year it’s different. If you look at the aerobiology, you have a lot of different pollen areas. There’s a lot of cities [in the South] that are hit hard each year during the spring allergy season.""

And Burgess agrees. ""Certain parts of the country appear to be experiencing higher than average pollen counts while others have shown lower counts,"" which could be thanks to the presence of El Niño, he said. ""Generally speaking, the United States has experienced a warmer than typical winter coupled with late winter precipitation that has created an earlier pollen season than typically seen.

San Bernardino. ,http://www.laweekly.com/news/heres-the-most-dangerous-city-in-california-6938087,"When asked to name the most dangerous place for crime in California, Compton, L.A.'s Eastside or the East Bay might come to mind.

You'd be wrong.

The most dangerous city in the Golden State when it comes to crime, police presence and other “community factors” such as poverty, the high school graduation rate and comparatively low police budgets, is in the Inland Empire.

It's San Bernardino.

That, at least, is according to the Southern California law firm of Graham Donath, which commissioned a report that crunches the numbers and gives us a list of California's most dangerous cities.

San Bernardino, a Great Recession–embattled town that's in bankruptcy, doesn't have the highest crime rate. Oakland and Stockton are worse when it comes to serious, violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and assault), the analysis found.

But when all the factors were calculated, including unemployment, police per capita and even the number of days in a year when the high temperature was higher than 80 degrees, San Bernardino is your winner, the Donath report says.

The city, for example, ranked in the top 10 for municipalities with the lowest investment in law enforcement. It also ranked in the top 10 for those “community factors” we talked about.

All across this great state there's a lot to be desired when it comes to fixing lawlessness, however.

The analysis notes that all of its top-10 cities had a poverty rate of nearly 15 percent (14.5) or greater. That includes Los Angeles, where about one in five people (21.2 percent) lives in poverty, according to the report.

San Bernardino's poverty rate is pegged at a whopping 30.6 percent.

The analysis cites the high cost of living as a possible pressure point for crime. We don't need to tell you that housing costs in L.A. are out of control.

“One explanation for high poverty levels in California cities could be the rising cost of living with stagnant wages,” the report says. “The poverty has actually grown in the state since 2007, and this could be because the increased cost of living is sending people into debt. It’s also encouraging people to leave or discouraging them from moving to the state.”

Los Angeles, by the way, ranked 19th on the dangerous cities list.",Here's the Most Dangerous City in California

Rameez Bukhari, a senior police officer from the local district, suggested that a worker at the shop “inadvertently” added pesticide to the laddus mix. “There was a pesticide shop close by which was being renovated, and the owner had left his pesticides at the bakery for safe keeping,” Bukhari was quoted as saying by Gulf News.

“A baker may have used a small packet in the sweet mixture,” he said, but added that police were awaiting the results of laboratory testing.

The Chief Minister of Punjab paid a visit to the village, assuring the locals there would be a thorough investigation.

Local health officials shut down the shop and sent samples to a laboratory in Lahore.

Friday, Dawn and other news outlets reported that the mystery was solved. Authorities finally tracked down the alleged cause of the mass poisoning when the younger brother of the sweet shop’s owner confessed that he had spiked the sweets with a pesticide. He wanted “to teach him [his brother] a lesson,” he reportedly told police.

The 18-year-old, identified as Khalid Mahmood, reportedly claimed his brother had “tortured him” and “insulted him on every trivial thing,” according to Pakistan’s SuchTV.",31 people suddenly dropped dead in a Pakistani village. Now police claim to know the horrible reason why.
The National Vietnam Veterans Foundation. ,http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/16/politics/vietnam-veterans-charity/index.html?sr=fbCNN051616vietnam-veterans-charity1155PMVODtopLink&linkId=24572564,"Story highlights The National Vietnam Veterans Foundation raised nearly $9 million in 2014 But it donated less than 2% of that money

Washington CNN —

At first glance, the National Vietnam Veterans Foundation is a roaring success. According to its tax filings, the charity has received more than $29 million in donations from generous Americans from 2010 to 2014 for what it calls on its website “aiding, supporting and benefiting America’s veterans and their families.”

But look a little closer on those same filings and you can see that nearly all of those donations have been cycled back to telemarketers, leaving less than 2 percent for actual veterans and veterans’ charitable causes.

That’s why Charity Navigator, one of the nation’s largest and most influential charity watchdog organizations, has given the charity a “zero” out of four stars for those same four years.

“It’s a zero-star organization and you can’t go lower than that,” says Michael Thatcher, Charity Navigator’s CEO. “They don’t have an independent board of directors, they actually don’t even have a comprehensive board of directors – only three members on the board at this point in time and some of them are family. So one can say, is this representative of an independent board? It’s not.”

The charity’s most recently filed tax return, for 2014, lists a catalogue of expenses paid for by donations: including $133,000 for travel, $21,000 for unnamed “awards”, $70,000 for a category described as “other expenses” and even a little more than $8,000 for parking.

Charity president works at VA

The CEO and founder of the National Vietnam Veterans Foundation, himself a veteran, is J. Thomas Burch, who is also a federal employee working as an attorney for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Burch is deputy director in the VA’s Office of General Counsel, where he pulled down $127,000 in salary in 2014. That’s the same year he drew a salary of $65,000 as head of his “zero-star” charity.

A VA spokesman told CNN Burch’s position at the veteran’s charity is not a conflict of interest “per se”. But the spokesman added the VA is now “reviewing” the situation and that the agency’s Office of Inspector General is handling that review.

When contacted by CNN, Burch asked that we not contact him at his job at the Department of Veterans Affairs, but he refused to answer phone calls placed to his home. CNN tried to confront Burch as he drove home from work in a black Rolls Royce, but upon seeing a CNN camera crew, Burch gunned the Rolls Royce down his suburban Washington, D.C. street and disappeared.

The charity’s vice president, David Kauffman, said in an email that the NVVF was responsible for “feeding homeless and unemployed veterans by donating to food banks, sent personal care kits to hospitalized veterans and donated blankets, hats and gloves to homeless centers.”

According to the charity’s tax filings, though, it accounted for about $122,000 in cash donations to veterans, out of more than $8.5 million raised in donations in 2014. That is less than 2% of the charities cash donations being used to support veterans and their families.",‘Worst’ charity for veterans run by VA employee

$116.8 billion. ,http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/16/investing/saudi-arabia-us-debt-ownership-revealed/index.html?sr=fbCNN051716saudi-arabia-us-debt-ownership-revealed0653AMVODtopLink&linkId=24579110,"One of the biggest mysteries in global finance was just revealed: How much U.S. debt Saudi Arabia owns.

Saudi Arabia stockpiled $116.8 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March, the Treasury Department announced on Monday, ending four decades of keeping the figure secret.

That makes Saudi Arabia the 13th largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, though well behind the $1 trillion-plus owned by China and Japan each. The Saudi figure was first reported by Bloomberg News based on a Freedom of Information Act request.

Unlike with most other major owners of U.S. debt, the Treasury Department kept Saudi Arabia's precise holdings secret since the 1970s. Saudi's holdings were lumped together with that of other oil exporting nations, including Venezuela and Iraq.

But that policy ended on Monday as the Treasury Department disclosed precise holdings by specific countries that were previously grouped together. A Treasury official told CNNMoney the move was made following a review aimed at trying to provide more ""comprehensive and transparent"" data.

The new Treasury report also revealed that the Cayman Islands, a country of less than 60,000 people, owned $265 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March. That's the third-highest sum in the world and a reflection of the nation's status as a major tax haven. The Cayman Islands does not have a corporate tax, encouraging multinational companies to store vast sums of money there to avoid taxes.

Likewise, Bermuda, another popular tax haven, is sitting on $63 billion of U.S. debt. Previously both the Cayman Islands and Bermuda were lumped together in a group of Caribbean banking center nations.

It is possible that Saudi Arabia owns even more U.S. debt than what was revealed on Monday. That's because Saudi Arabia's central bank listed owning $587 billion of foreign reserves as of March. Typically, central banks park the majority of their foreign reserves in U.S. Treasuries. In other words, the numbers don't really add up.

One possibility: Saudi Arabia could be taking a page out of China's playbook. Many analysts believe China owns U.S. debt through custodial accounts in Belgium, a relatively tiny country that listed owning over $154 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March.

Related: Who owns America's debt?

The Saudi mystery had taken on greater significance in recent months. Since the end of 2014 the Saudis have burned through more than $130 billion of foreign-exchange reserves -- most likely including U.S. debt -- to help cope with the crash in oil prices. The Treasury Department said Saudi Arabia's U.S. debt holdings of $116.8 billion are down from $123.6 billion in January.

Additionally, rising tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia led the kingdom to make a recent shocking threat. Sources told CNN in April that Saudi Arabia threatened to sell off American assets if Congress passed a bill that would allow 9/11 victims to sue foreign governments. A Saudi source at the time told CNNMoney that the kingdom was ""serious"" about this threat.

Dumping a vast sum of U.S. Treasuries at once could cause the securities to tank, potentially destabilizing global financial markets. It could also severely hurt Saudi Arabia's own finances, leading many experts to conclude the threat was empty.",Revealed: Saudi Arabia owns $117 billion of U.S. debt

They don't feel like their leadership skills are being developed. ,http://www.businessinsider.com/why-millennial-employees-are-quitting-2016-1?utm_content=buffer1f2db&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer,"Two-thirds of millennials plan to leave their current organization by 2020. Flickr/Erin Kelly New research finds two-thirds of millennials plan to leave their current organization by 2020. One-quarter see themselves elsewhere within the next year.

While you could argue that young workers have always been inclined to job hop (and millennials are less inclined to do so), their reasons for restlessness may have changed.

Young workers' latest gripe? Insufficient opportunities to develop their leadership skills.

That's according to the fifth annual Global Millennials survey, cited on Bloomberg, for which Deloitte reached out to nearly 7,700 working college-educated professionals in 29 countries.

As many as 63% of respondents said their leadership skills are not being fully developed.

And it seems to be a key reason behind their willingness to leave: While 71% of those likely to leave in the next two years are dissatisfied with how their leadership skills are being developed, that number drops to 54% among those who are planning to stay beyond 2020.

As Punit Renjen, chief executive officer of Deloitte Global, told Bloomberg, young workers' pursuit of leadership skills even at the expense of switching jobs is a new phenomenon.

Perhaps it has something to do with the recent trend of flattening organizations, which was highlighted in The Washington Post. In an effort to cut costs, organizations have removed levels of bureaucracy, which means there's not much of a corporate ladder to climb anymore.

""The biggest driver of disengagement is people feeling like they're stuck in a job, and there's nothing for them there,"" one expert told The Post. ""It's easier to quit your company and find a new job than find a new job within your own company.""

Restoring some semblance of a corporate ladder may require a good deal of structural reorganization. In the meantime, managers can take small steps to help their employees develop into leadership positions.

The Wall Street Journal recommends creating mentoring programs in which workers are paired with more senior employees at their company. You can also rotate your employees through different jobs, so they gain new knowledge and expertise.

As for individual employees, US News & World Report suggests being proactive instead of waiting for a leadership position to open up.

If you work for a large company, you can speak to someone in human resources and ask what you should be learning to reach the next level. You can also volunteer to take charge of a particular project, so that management recognizes your capabilities.",Here's a key reason why all of your millennial employees are quitting

",http://www.vice.com/read/immigrants-explain-what-shocked-them-about-american-culture,"I grew up in Australia—a country not unlike the United States—but I was completely floored the first time I visited an American grocery store. In Australia, there are only a few brands of milk, butter, and bread. Milk generally has one ingredient (you know, milk), the cheese isn't fluorescent orange, and bread does not come in a can. In America, options for a single product type barely fit into one aisle. It was my first major experience of culture shock —which can feel like a hurtful reminder that you're not ""home"" anymore.

During one of my first Christmases in America, I remember watching intently as my sister-in-law pulled out a cylinder from the fridge, cracked it open, and scooped sections of white goop onto a baking tray. A few minutes later, steaming rolls emerged.

""It is so frustrating here. Nothing is easy. Nothing is efficient. To pay rent, you have to use a check? I have never written a check.

I went to the post office yesterday, and I was waiting in line for maybe an hour—and there were only five people in front of me. I felt like I went from a Western country to a third-world country.

""I had not seen or even heard of braces before [coming to America]. I had friends in Korea who had really messed up teeth, but it wasn't necessarily seen as any kind of defect. I started seventh grade in the US and several of the kids had braces—the type with wires going across both upper and bottom teeth with a metal holder in front of each tooth. They looked almost like robots. I didn't actually find out what they were until maybe two years or so later, because I didn't have the language skill to ask about them initially. To me, teeth were just what you had. If you had good teeth, you had good teeth. Bad teeth, then bad teeth. It didn't seem like you could move your teeth like that. They felt very solidly planted in my mouth so the entire concept was foreign."" — Chae An, 45, attorney, South Korean

Often you are rewarded here for being an extrovert. Basically an introvert cannot survive in your classroom. In China, I don't have to clean [my] chalk board. It is the students' responsibility to clean the classroom. In China, teachers are very high ranking. You are very respected. Here, I don't think so. The income is not really above middle class here."" — Niki Xu, 26, math teacher, Chinese

""The whole paper towel thing struck me very strongly as soon as I came to the US. In Korea, paper towels were used for very few selective kitchen tasks, mostly to wipe off oil from frying pans. So I enter a US host family's house and they use paper towels for everything. They don't bother to even keep a rag. It's the same thing with schools—just big rolls of paper towels for when you spill something. But honestly, when I went to Korea last year, I noticed that things have changed. They now have paper towel disposals in a lot of bathrooms."" — Chandra Edwards, 27, financial analyst, South Korean

""Food-wise, I noticed us all getting these round faces from the bad food we ate. We did not realize it, because it was the standard and you think because it's advertised and readily available it can't be bad for you.

Then, once we got here, we ate those corn dogs almost every day for lunch, little pizzas for snacks, and sugary cereals for breakfast."" — Ben van den Heever, 32, founder of Brooklyn Biltong, South African

""I was hugely shocked by all the street harassment. And as a queer woman, I didn't realize that I had to police myself in certain areas here. I thought NYC was supposed to be such a gay city, and it is if you're in Manhattan or Chelsea. When I first moved here I remember my girlfriend and I were kissing on the street outside of our apartment in Bushwick and a group of teenagers started yelling and jeering at us. It was kind of scary and very confusing. I've learned not to hold hands or display affection in certain neighborhoods because of it.

And I don't know if it's the Canadian in me, but I always give a full answer, so maybe I am engaging too much.

"Delegate allocations rules were abruptly changed, benefiting Clinton.
",http://www.salon.com/2016/05/16/what_the_hell_just_happened_in_nevada_sanders_supporters_are_fed_up_and_rightfully_so/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=socialflow,"Chaos erupted at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday as supporters of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed over the awarding of the state's 35 pledged delegates. Clinton edged Sanders in the Nevada caucus on Feb. 20th (52.6 percent to 47.3 percent). On April 2, however, the state party held its Clark County convention and Sanders mobilized more delegates than the Clinton campaign (1,613 to 1,298), which swung the delegate count in his favor.

At the state convention this weekend, the final step in the process, Sanders supporters hoped to secure the lion's share of the remaining 12 delegates. Instead, the delegate allocation rules were abruptly changed and Clinton was awarded 7 of the 12 delegates. State party chair, Roberta Lange, told caucus-goers that the “ruling by the Chair is not debatable; we cannot be challenged and I move that...and I announce that the rules have been passed by the body.” Predictably, a chorus of boos followed and the convention was forced to end on a frenzied note.

What happened in Nevada is likely to happen elsewhere. The perception that the DNC has thrown its institutional support behind Clinton has only deepened the internal divide within the party. The Sanders wing is pissed off, and rightfully so.

The establishment support for Clinton was apparent in the superdelegate gap. Superdelegates are a noxious device to begin with, but they're part of the process and, however objectionable Sanders supporters find them, no rules have been broken on that front. In New York, however, where the process wasn't so much rigged as designed to make it uncommonly difficult for non-incumbents or Democratic challengers to compete are problematic at best, particularly in this climate.

Then there's the Hillary Victory Fund, which has become a massive fundraising vehicle for the Clinton campaign. The HVF was created by the DNC and Clinton's super PAC Hillary for America as a means of raising funds both for the Clinton campaign and down-ballot races across the country. Individuals can give over $350,000 to the joint committee if they donate the maximum amount to Clinton, the DNC and the state parties. Federal elections laws, however, do not allow individual donations to specific candidates to exceed $2,700.

The problem, though, as Politico reported two weeks ago, is that Clinton, aided by the DNC, appears to be skirting this rule and funneling large-dollar donations back to her campaign via the HVF. “The victory fund,” the report indicates, “has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but almost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who controls the committee.” At best, this is a violation of the spirit of the elections laws and, more importantly, an affront to Democrats supporting Bernie Sanders.

It's not at all surprising – or wrong, to be fair – that establishment Democrats would support Hillary Clinton. Clinton is a party veteran and a known commodity. She's been at the center of Democratic politics for decades. Sanders, on the other hand, has been an independent for much of his career in the Senate, though he's caucused with the party for years. Sanders is also well to the left of mainstream Democrats, which is part of his appeal with primary voters.

But the Democratic establishment can maintain neutrality in this process without compromising their preferred candidate. The fact is, Clinton has received at least 2.5 million more primary votes than Sanders. She was – and is – likely to win the nomination. There's no need to rig the process or skew the rules in her favor – doing so only adds to the suspicion that the process itself is undemocratic, which is ruinous to the party's long-term viability.

It's still unclear what the hell happened in Nevada. The optics are terrible – that's for sure. Ultimately, the state's few remaining delegates are meaningless and won't alter the dynamics of the race. But the reports are sufficiently murky that both Sanders and Clinton supporters will grow more entrenched as a result of what happened there. That won't hurt the Sanders campaign, but it will undermine the efforts of the DNC and the Clinton campaign to unify the party against the GOP and Donald Trump.",What the hell just happened in Nevada? Sanders supporters are fed up — and rightfully so

Sophie Grégoire Trudeau told a French-language newspaper based in Quebec that she was keen to do more but she was overwhelmed with work and struggled with just one aid.

“I’d love to be everywhere but I can’t,” she told Le Soleil. “I have three children and a husband who is Prime Minister. I need help. I need a team to help me serve the people.”

Ms Grégoire Trudeau, a 41-year-old former television presenter, said she had been inundated with requests from charities to promote their causes since becoming Canada’s “first lady” but it was not possible for her to respond to everyone.

“It’s hard to choose, because it’s touching when people ask for your help,” she explained. “People really lay out their suffering in some of the letters that I receive. I tell myself: ‘I’ll try to send a message that will reach as many people as possible’.”

Her comments have prompted an onslaught of criticism from opposition politicians who argue she is detached from reality. Conservative Canadian MP Candice Bergen drew attention to the fact the former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's wife, Laureen, had managed with just a single aide. While new democrat MP, Niki Ashton, said she was disconnected from the wider Canadian public.

“Hearing statements like that certainly does not speak to the reality that Canadian women face and the kind of struggles that, you know, that they’re undertaking day in, day out,” Ms Ashton said. “Certainly the kind of statements we heard from the prime minister’s wife, you know, speak to that disconnect with the reality that Canadian women face.”

The issue has been fiercely debated on social media, with the hashtag #jesuissophie and #prayforsophie trending and there has been an onslaught of column pieces exploring the divisive issue.

""If you think Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau shouldn't have help because she 'doesn't have a job', you might want to Google the word 'misogyny',"" wrote one Twitter user.

“Instead of sexist remarks #sophiegregoiretrudeau deserves acclaim + extra help for standing up for women!” added another.

But the majority of Twitter users have been less sympathetic to her situation.

“Dear Sophie when you seek recognition for doing charity, it is not charity at all,” wrote one user.

While another said, “I get she's the PM wife + has demands of her time, but think of any other Cdn woman you know, we all do. And we all deal with it”.

"""Walk in like you own the place"". ",http://www.businessinsider.com/former-yum-ceo-david-novak-shares-best-career-advice-for-20-somethings-2016-5,"Yum Brands cofounder and former chairman and CEO David Novak. Hollis Johnson

During his tenure as CEO of Yum Brands from 1999 to 2015, David Novak turned a PepsiCo spinoff into a global leader in the fast-food industry through brands like Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut.

Today, it has 41,000 restaurants across 125 countries and a market capitalization of about $33 billion.

Novak is retiring this month from his role as Yum's executive chairman, but he took time to speak with Business Insider about the lessons he's learned throughout his career.

As he illustrates in his new book, ""O Great One!,"" he considers recognizing great work at Yum to be the foundation for his success, and he advocates that all leaders follow suit.

While it's up to managers to recognize their employees, the employees themselves can boost their chances of being recognized by working to become integral to their company from their first day on the job. It's why he tells all 20-somethings just starting their careers, ""When you go into your job, act like you own the place.""

Entitled 22-year-olds aren't going to win any friends at a company, but Novak isn't recommending that young employees behave arrogantly. Rather, he recommends they integrate themselves into their companies sooner rather than later.

""Don't just go in and do your job,"" he said. ""Think about what your coach ought to be doing, or the CEO ought to be doing. Take as broad a perspective on the company as possible, and always take a company view, not just your job view. And that will demonstrate to other people that you've got potential.""

He said that early in his own career, he would seek opportunities to have conversations with his bosses and tell them three things he'd be working on if he were in their place. It was a bold move for a young employee, but he kept it graceful by making them expressions of his own interest in his team's goals, rather than something patronizing.

Novak said that neophytes needed to understand that the way to get people to teach you is to simply ask them questions, since ""everybody likes to talk about what they've learned.""

He recommended that new employees ""go find the four or five people in the company that you know are really highly respected and go have lunch with them,"" and then ask them about their own careers and how they learned to succeed at the company.

""And they'll take it as a compliment if you seek them out because they're viewed to be so successful and you've heard a lot of good things about them,"" he said.

If 20-somethings can be driven and confident yet also respectful and open to input, they'll become recognized at the company, Novak said. And they shouldn't worry about feeling aggressive.

""A lot of people think that if you do stuff like that you're political,"" he said. ""You're not political. You're just wanting to learn. As long as you're never sacrificing your integrity, don't worry about anything. Just learn.""",Former CEO of a $33 billion fast-food company explains why his best career advice for 20-somethings is 'Walk in like you own the place'
"Hundreds of the rancher’s cattle are still grazing on public land in southern Nevada. Conservationists want the cattle seized, saying they are damaging tortoise habitat. ",https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/cliven-bundys-cattle-are-allegedly-still-roaming-unchecked-i?bffbnews&utm_term=.gkNN0w1MJ#.dvQWrQZ7P,"Rob Mrowka, a scientist with the Center for Biological diversity, said the Bundy cattle are essentially ""feral,"" roaming at will over hundreds of thousands of acres — including far outside the range where long ago they were permitted. (Bundy stopped paying his grazing fees in 1993, meaning the cattle were technically trespassing anywhere on public land after that point.)

The area occupied by the cattle is also one of the driest in the U.S., Mrowka said, and the cattle end up out-competing the tortoise for limited food.

""The problem is that the cattle are out there constantly and get first dibs,"" Mrowka added.

Bundy is currently behind bars awaiting trial after being arrested in February at Portland airport on charges stemming from his role in the tense 2014 standoff with federal officials near his Nevada ranch.

Cliven Bundy's lawyer Joel Hansen told BuzzFeed News that there are still cattle on the range, and that ranching operations are being run by Bundy's wife and other women in the family while the rancher awaits trial.

Hansen disagreed that cattle harm tortoise habitat.

""The environmentalists say that it's bad for the tortoise if you have cattle on the land, that's false,"" Hansen said.

Reached by TIME Friday, a Guinness World Records spokesperson said the group is beginning to review research and will make an official announcement “in the coming weeks.”

According to the New York Times, which profiled Morano in 2015 when she was 115 years old, her secret to longevity is twofold: raw eggs and no husband. She’s been eating three raw eggs per day since she was a teenager, and as for being single for most of her life: “I didn’t want to be dominated by anyone,” she said.

"Home demolitions, denial of building permits and restrictions on family reunification. ",http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/israel-forces-palestinians-jerusalem-160504063755669.html,"Jerusalem – Tucked away on a steep, potholed street in Sur Baher, a suburb in the southeastern hills of Jerusalem, Sarah Ali Dwayat’s apartment sits empty.

On the front porch, a large banner bears the photographs of five teenagers from the neighbourhood currently imprisoned by Israel. One of them is her 19-year-old son, Abed.

The group stands accused of throwing stones at Israeli vehicles on a highway, allegedly causing the death of a driver, after clashes between police and Palestinian youths last September, on the eve of the Jewish New Year.

The trial is still going on, but already some of their family members have been forced from their homes – the victims of new measures ostensibly aimed at deterring alleged Palestinian attackers.

“When we got the confiscation notice, we took all the furniture out, and now it’s scattered with friends and neighbours,” Sarah said, pushing back a metal sheet covering one window to sneak a look inside.

Doorknobs to the home have been broken off, and entrances sealed with melted metal plates. Sarah, a widow for 15 years, and her 24-year-old daughter have moved to a smaller apartment in the same area, provided by a neighbour as a goodwill gesture.

Sooner or later, they will have to start paying rent again, Sarah acknowledged – and with property prices sky-high in Jerusalem, they will not be able to afford it. “We had just started renovation work. Abed had found a job and had started to help. We are still paying the debts,” Sarah, 59, told Al Jazeera.

“When they came to seal the house [last month], a soldier told me, in Arabic, that it was to send a message to others, so they wouldn’t carry out more acts of terror.”

READ MORE: Israeli home demolition reach record high

Since last October, tensions have boiled over into violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the blockaded Gaza Strip.

During this period, the Israeli army has killed at least 206 Palestinians, including protesters, bystanders and alleged attackers, while 33 Israelis have been killed in stabbing and shooting incidents.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a series of measures directed at alleged Palestinian attackers and their families, including the demolition or sealing of attackers’ homes and the revocation of permanent residency status for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem.

Munir Nusseibeh, a human rights lawyer and director of the Community Action Centre at al-Quds University, believed that Sarah’s son and two of his co-accused, Muhammad Abu Kaf, 17, and Mustafa Atrash, 18, were “test cases”. Israel’s interior minister issued a decision to strip all three of their Jerusalem residency in January, a move that is now being appealed in court.

“They are the first at risk of residency revocation for throwing stones, and the first whose families have been displaced from their homes for throwing stones,” Nusseibeh told Al Jazeera.

Allegiance, which allegiance? We pay tax to the Israeli municipality, and we get nothing in return. Did Yigal Amir get his citizenship revoked for killing the prime minister of Israel? by Abu Walid, father of Mustafa Atrash, who is on trial over stone-throwing allegations

A letter to Abed’s lawyer from the Israeli Interior ministry states that “a permanent residency status in Israel is based on a material connection between the resident and the state” and that it “requires basic commitment and loyalty in view of the fact that residency, and all the more so permanent residency, is not a status which only grants rights without any obligations”.

When Israel occupied and unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, Palestinians were designated as “permanent residents” rather than citizens of the state, a status akin to that of migrants in a foreign country. Since then, over 14,000 have had their residency revoked.

Over the years, the criteria for revoking residency have broadened. Two decades ago, Israel’s interior ministry revoked the residency of Palestinians who lived abroad for seven or more years, or who obtained residency or citizenship status in another country.

But after the Oslo Accords, a new policy was introduced whereby Palestinians would lose residency rights if they established their “centre of life” outside of Israel – such as in the West Bank or Gaza. Some 11,000 out of the 14,000 had their residency revoked under this policy.

READ MORE: East Jerusalem suffocates under harsh Israeli siege

In 2006, three elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council had their Jerusalem residency revoked on new grounds: “breach of allegiance to the state”. Their case is still pending before the Supreme Court.

“No one was arguing that these parliamentarians posed a specific security threat to Israel, but rather it was because of their political belonging that they decided to cancel their right to live in Jerusalem,” Nusseibeh said, noting that there are 13 known cases of residency revocation under the allegiance criteria.

“If the Supreme Court approves the residency revocations in the 2006 case based on breach of allegiance, this will make a new important precedent – it will be the first time that the Supreme Court approves revoking residency based on political, rather than security reasons,” Nusseibeh said.

“All Palestinians in Jerusalem will be at risk of residency revocation according to the allegiance criteria, because Palestinians in East Jerusalem see the occupation as temporary and Israel as a foreign occupying power.”

Abu Walid, the father of Mustafa Atrash, was indignant at this policy. “Allegiance, which allegiance? We pay tax to the Israeli municipality, and we get nothing in return,” he told Al Jazeera. “Did Yigal Amir get his citizenship revoked for killing the prime minister of Israel?” he added, referring to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a right-wing Israeli extremist in 1995.





Abir Joubran-Dakwar, a lawyer for the Israeli human rights organisation Hamoked who is working on the Sur Baher case, noted that there are a number of specific criteria under which citizenship can be revoked, including “breach of allegiance”.

However, this does not apply to residency, she said: “A person who has his citizenship revoked becomes stateless, but the interior ministry will still have to give him a permanent residency status.”

Israel’s interior ministry did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the matter.

At the end of April, Israel’s attorney-general temporarily suspended the revocation in the Sur Baher case, until the Supreme Court comes to a decision in the 2006 case.

Human rights groups, including B’Tselem, have argued in the past that home demolitions, denial of building permits, restrictions on family reunification, and the building of the separation wall are all among the variety of methods used by Israel to forcibly displace Palestinians and maintain a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, in violation of international law.

“I believe the aim of this policy is to add a new method for the displacement of Palestinians in East Jerusalem, to be able to displace even larger numbers,” Nusseibeh said. “That’s our concern.”",How Israel forces more Palestinians out of Jerusalem

"It depends on where it's purchased. If it's purchased in Florida, then it's an in-state private purchase and would not be subject to a background check. ",http://ti.me/1T8RD1F,"The gun George Zimmerman used in 2012 to kill Trayvon Martin showed up on two separate online gun sales sites Thursday. But do online sales mean it wouldn’t go through a standard background check? That all depends on where it’s purchased, gun experts say.

Zimmerman initially listed the handgun that he used to kill Martin, a black 17-year-old in Sanford, Fla., on gunbroker.com, along with a note saying he would dedicate some of the proceeds to fighting “BLM violence against Law Enforcement officers,” presumably referring to the Black Lives Matter movement. But the gun sale website quickly removed the listing. Zimmerman then posted a listing for the gun on unitedgungroup.com, a similar online gun sales site. No matter which site Zimmerman uses to sell the gun, the purchaser’s location will determine whether a background check will be performed.

Gun sales websites aren’t allowed to sell guns directly to people, but instead bring buyers and sellers together. They also don’t conduct background checks or directly transport firearms to purchasers, says Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who studies gun policy.

“There is no such thing as an online gun sale,” Volokh says, referring to the limits placed on sites that arrange gun sales.

If the gun is purchased by somebody in Florida, where Zimmerman lives, it would be considered an in-state private purchase and would not be subject to a background check. Neither federal nor Florida law requires checks for in-state transactions.

“What’s often misunderstood is that this is some kind of loophole,” says Dave Kopel, an associate policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. “But it’s the same rules for online sales. It varies state by state, but in most you can sell private-to-private within the state.”

Read more: Broker Refuses to Auction Off George Zimmerman’s Gun

If the purchaser is from out of state, however, federal law requires that the seller ship the firearm to a licensed gun dealer in the purchaser’s state. That dealer will then run a background check in the same manner as any other gun purchase from a dealer.

“This works quite routinely in far less lurid contexts,” Volokh says.

Zimmerman was acquitted in Martin’s death in 2013 but has had a series of run-ins with police since then. He was arrested on assault charges in January 2015 and has had multiple confrontations with Matthew Apperson, who was accused of shooting and injuring Zimmerman in May 2015.

"Maybe, but probably not. They have to do ""research."" ",http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/12/did-pope-francis-just-pave-the-way-for-women-priests.html,"ROME — At what was meant to be a love fest for 900 nuns at a meeting of the International Union of Superiors General at the Vatican on Thursday, Pope Francis didn’t just rock the boat; he may have created a tidal wave.

During the question and answer session of the meeting, one of the sisters at the conference brought up the fact that women had served as deacons in the early church.

Then, according to the National Catholic Reporter, she asked the pope, “Why not construct an official commission that might study the question?”

Francis then said that he had discussed the matter of those early deaconesses with a professor several years earlier, but that he remained unclear about what role they actually served.

“What were these female deacons?” Francis said he asked the professor, according to the National Catholic Reporter. “Did they have ordination or no? It was a bit obscure. What was the role of the deaconess in that time?”

Then, apparently thinking out loud, he endorsed the idea.

“Constituting an official commission that might study the question?” Francis asked. “I believe yes. It would do good for the church to clarify this point. I am in agreement. I will speak to do something like this.”

The pope went on to address other concerns from the group of sisters, and dole out advice like “take a deep breath” and “get more sleep” and then revisited the topic. “I accept,” the pope said. “It seems useful to me to have a commission that would clarify this well.”

Deacons in the Catholic context act as a sort of priest-lite: they cannot perform the sacrament of the Eucharist (give holy communion) and they don’t have to take the vow of celibacy; in fact many are married. But they can perform any number of ministerial roles, from baptisms to funerals, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops website, which is something many of the world’s Catholics just might appreciate.

Quoting canon 1024 of the Code of Canon Law, Catholic website Crux points out that at the moment, “only a baptized male can receive the sacrament of ordination, so the law does not presently permit female deacons.” Crux editors then question whether Francis will change the law, which is within his powers as pope.

As exciting as this is for roughly one half of the world’s Catholic population (the female half), surely not everyone will be pleased at the idea of women nudging one step closer to the all-male clergy club that rules the Catholic Church.

Almost immediately, liberal priests tweeted their praise. Father James Martin, a prolific author priest from New York, tweeted that the news filled him with “immense joy” and that, “Women deacons would be able to baptize, preside at marriages and funerals, and preach at Mass. It would be an immense gift to the church.”

A more conservative priest tweeted, “Has @Pontifex forgotten about this 2002 study about diaconate where issue of women deacons was examined?” referring to a Vatican study that all but nixed the idea.

Even if the special commission Pope Francis promised today does pave the way to the ordination of women deacons, they may never have a hope in Hell of being allowed to enter the full priesthood. But they are certainly one step closer than they have ever been before.",Did Pope Francis Just Pave the Way for Women Priests?
65. ,http://huff.to/1q5HnLI,"Looks like 65 is the new 55! According to a poll conducted by Marist College, most Americans -- 55 percent -- consider 65 to be middle-aged. Some 34 percent consider age 65 ""old"" while 11 percent consider it ""young.""

Only a year ago, a study out of Stony Brook University in New York found that age 60 should be considered the new middle age.

Not surprisingly, age plays a role in one's perceptions. Among those Marist respondents who are 45 and older, 63 percent are more likely than younger respondents to think of 65 as middle-aged. When it comes to those younger than 45, 49 percent believe 65 is old while 47 percent refer to it as middle-aged. For those under 30, 60 percent consider 65 to be old. The Marist poll involved 1,297 adults surveyed over the phone in late March.

Researchers have said that people are hitting middle age later in life simply because they are living longer than ever before. A 2014 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the U.S. life expectancy reached a record high of 78.8 years in 2012. Life expectancy was higher for women than men; 81.2 years for women compared with 76.4 years for men.

"It has been removed by an unknown party, and the Bureau of Land Management says they did not remove the structure. ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/mysterious-silver-monolith-disappears-from-utah-desert-1.5209169,"A tall, silver, shining metal monolith discovered in the desert in southeastern Utah -- which prompted theories of alien placement and drew determined hikers to its secret location -- has now disappeared, the state's Bureau of Land Management said Saturday.

The monolith was removed by an ""unknown party"" sometime Friday night, the agency said in a Facebook post.

""We have received credible reports that the illegally installed structure, referred to as the 'monolith,' has been removed"" from BLM public lands, the post said.

""The BLM did not remove the structure, which is considered private property.""

'WE'VE GOT TO GO LOOK AT IT!'

The monolith was first discovered November 18 by officers from the Utah Department of Public Safety's Aero Bureau.

They were flying by helicopter, helping the Division of Wildlife Resources count bighorn sheep in southeastern Utah, when they spotted something that seemed right out of ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""

""One of the biologists ... spotted it, and we just happened to fly directly over the top of it,"" pilot Bret Hutchings told CNN affiliate KSL. ""He was like, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, turn around, turn around!' And I was like, 'What.' And he's like, 'There's this thing back there -- we've got to go look at it!'""

And there it was -- in the middle of the red rock was a shiny, silver metal monolith sticking out of the ground. Hutchings guessed it was ""between 10 and 12 feet high."" It didn't look like it was randomly dropped to the ground, he told KSL, but rather it looked like it had been planted.

""I'm assuming it's some new wave artist or something or, you know, somebody that was a big (""2001: A Space Odyssey"") fan,"" he said, referencing a scene in the 1968 film where a black monolith appears.

Still, it is illegal to install structures or art without authorization on public lands ""no matter what planet you're from,"" said Utah DPS in a statement released Monday.

WHERE IS IT?

The location of the monolith was not disclosed because authorities said they didn't want curiosity seekers to become stranded in the remote landscape and need to be rescued.

But of course, that didn't stop some. Several people already successfully located the monolith, tucked in a redrock slot canyon south of Moab.

The trek involved driving in the darkness over rocky terrain and verifying GPS coordinates, according to three people who went to see it. At least one explorer got lost at first. But the trip was worth it, they said, even if the monolith wasn't the work of aliens.

David Surber may have been among the very first to view the monolith in person. The coordinates to the monolith were circulating on Reddit, but none of the users could confirm they were correct. Surber volunteered to find out.

The coordinates were indeed correct, and Surber eagerly shared the results of his visit with 200 Reddit users who'd flooded his inbox. Among his findings: The monolith wasn't magnetic or solid (he said it sounded ""like a cardboard box"" when he knocked on it). He also shared step-by-step instructions for the drive out to the monolith.

The mummy was a 5-year-old girl but was decorated with a portrait of a woman. ,https://www.sciencealert.com/x-ray-of-a-mummified-child-from-ancient-egypt-reveals-surprise-finding,"An Egyptian mummy that was decorated with a woman's portrait contained a surprise – the body of a child who was only 5 years old when she died.

Now, scientists have learned more about the mysterious girl and her burial, thanks to high-resolution scans and X-ray ""microbeams"" that targeted very small regions in the intact artifact.

Computed X-ray tomography (CT) scans of the mummy's teeth and femur confirmed the girl's age, though they showed no signs of trauma in her bones that could suggest the cause of her death.

Targeted, high-intensity X-rays also revealed a mysterious object that had been placed on the child's abdomen, scientists reported in a new study.

Scans performed on the mummy about two decades ago were low contrast, and many details were hard to see. For the new analysis, researchers conducted new CT scans to visualize the mummy's structure in its entirety.

They then focused on specific regions using X-ray diffraction, in which a tightly concentrated beam of X-rays bounces off the atoms in crystalline structures; variations in the diffraction patterns reveal what type of material the object is made of.

This is the first time that X-ray diffraction has been used on an intact mummy, said lead study author Stuart Stock, a research professor of cell and developmental biology in the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago.

The mummy, known as ""Hawara Portrait Mummy No. 4,"" is in the collection of Northwestern University's Block Museum of Art. It was excavated between 1910 and 1911 from the ancient Egyptian site of Hawara, and it dates to around the first century A.D., when Egypt was under Roman rule.

""During the Roman era in Egypt, they started making mummies with portraits attached to the front surface,"" Stock told Live Science.

""Many thousands were made, but most of the portraits have been removed from the mummies we have – maybe only 100 to 150 still have the portrait attached to the mummy,"" he said.

Though the portrait on Mummy No. 4 showed an adult woman, the small size of the mummy hinted otherwise – and the scans confirmed that the mummy was a child, still so young that none of her permanent teeth had emerged.

Her body measured 37 inches (937 millimeters) from the top of her skull to the soles of her feet, and the wrappings added another 2 inches (50 mm), according to the study.

The researchers also detected 36 needle-like structures in the case – 11 around the head and neck, 20 near the feet and five by the torso. X-ray diffraction determined that these were modern metal wires or pins that may have been added to stabilize the artifact sometime during the last century.

One surprising find was an irregular layer of sediment in the mummy's wrappings, perhaps mud that had been used by the attending priests to secure the mummy's bandages, Stock suggested.

Another puzzling discovery was a small, elliptical object about 0.3 inches (7 mm) long, which the researchers found in the mummy's wrappings over the abdomen, dubbing the object ""Inclusion F.""

(Stuart R. Stock)

X-ray diffraction showed that it was made of calcite – but what was it? One possibility is that it could be an amulet included because the child's body was damaged during mummification, Stock said.

After such a mishap, priests would often place an amulet such as a scarab over the damaged body part to protect the person in the afterlife, and the newfound calcite ""blob"" was about the right size and in the right position for it to be a protective scarab, Stock explained.

However, the resolution of the CT scan wasn't high enough to show carved details in the object, so it's impossible to say for sure what it could be, he added.

""Every time you go into a study like this, you get good answers. But then you just raise more questions,"" Stock said.

The findings were published online Nov. 25 in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

Stinging nettle. ,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/one-herb-block-fat-study-042017575.html,"We all know that washing down a Burger King Triple Whopper with a Diet Coke does nothing to erase the fat and calories your fast-food indulgence is packing. But what if washing it down with a nice cup of stinging nettle tea could actually neutralize the fat bomb's fat-packing effects? A recent study published in the scientific journal Nutrients appears to suggest that may be the case. And as you'll see, it actually makes a good bit of sense.

Stinging nettle is a springtime flowering plant that grows abundantly all around the world, including in the U.S. Its extract is used in various dietary supplements, although there's little evidence to suggest the extract has any real benefits. The leaves, however, which are known to be rich in a number of nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and carotenoids, can be used as a safe and effective diuretic, as well as to support milk production in nursing women. Now, a group of scientists out of the University of Maryland has demonstrated that those leaves could end up becoming a powerful tool in the fight against diet-induced obesity. (Related: 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time.)

Based on their own prior research, which showed that stinging nettle extract could improve blood sugar metabolism in mice, the scientists, led by Dr. Diane N. Obanda, had reason to believe that feeding mice the leaves from the stinging nettle plant might actually prevent the mice from gaining weight—even while being fed a high-fat diet.

To test their theory, Dr. Obanda's team divided 36 male mice into four cohorts:

The first group of 9 was fed a low-fat diet for 12 weeks

The second group of 9 was fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks

The third group of 9 was fed a high-fat diet that also included stinging nettle for 12 weeks

The fourth group of 9 was fed a high-fat diet for six weeks, and then for the six weeks after that had stinging nettle added to their diet.

As expected, the low-fat diet resulted in significantly less weight gain and body fat accumulation than the high-fat diet. But, the addition of stinging nettle in the third group resulted in significantly less weight gain and body fat accumulation. In the fourth group, the weight gain and body fat accumulation slowed significantly after stinging nettle was incorporated into the diet.

Dr. Obanda and her team were, therefore, able to conclude that stinging nettle, when consumed as an herb (as opposed to an extract), has a positive effect on metabolism (although they were not able to say precisely why; that will have to wait for further research). And because of the similarities between mice and humans in terms of anatomy, physiology, and genetics, there is reason to hope these results will carry over to human subjects. However, that too will require additional research.

"""The type of vaccine it is may lead to better long-term immunity."" ",https://www.popsci.com/story/health/astrazeneca-oxford-covid-vaccine/,"For the third Monday in a row, Americans have woken up to positive news about the race to develop an effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine. This time, a third vaccine candidate joined the ranks of those with promising Phase II/III trials. Made by AstraZeneca, and first developed by researchers at Oxford University, this vaccine candidate differs in approach from those already premiered by Pfizer and Moderna. The drug company announced today that its vaccine, as of now, has an average 70 percent efficacy rate over two trials with different protocols. That’s less than both the two other candidates. However, it could still have certain advantages compared to the other two current front runners.

The type of vaccine it is may lead to better long-term immunity, says Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. The AstraZeneca vaccine relies on a modified and weakened version of a virus that infects chimpanzees to deliver a small amount of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material to those vaccinated—effectively teaching the body’s own immune response to recognize and attack the new pathogen.

The other two vaccines that have announced positive results from Phase II/III trials, produced by Moderna and Pfizer, both rely on a new method to develop a vaccine. Known as modified RNA (mRNA) vaccines, these treatments are a new class of vaccine that uses modified messenger RNA to instruct the body’s own cells to make viral proteins it can then recognize.

Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines “showed incredibly high efficacy in diverse populations around the world,” says Gandhi. Results from both showed about 95 percent efficacy in trial populations.

By contrast, the efficacy rate of the AstraZeneca vaccine currently appears to be highly dose-dependent and to sit at what the company is calling an average 70 percent efficacy rate, which basically means how well a drug works in controlled trials, but not necessarily how it will work in the real world. Until the drug maker releases more information, there’s no way to know exactly how effective it is, especially when it gets used in conditions outside regimented clinical trials, or how much more effective it might become with more trials and research.

The 70 percent rate comes from two trial protocols with different dosing regimens. The first gave a half dose of the vaccine first followed by a full dose of the preventative drug at least a month later. This protocol resulted in a 90 percent effectiveness rate. The second regimen gave two full doses exactly a month apart, which provided a 62 percent effectiveness rate. “Putting those two trial results together, they come up with this 70 percent efficacy [average],” Gandhi says. But until the company releases more information, there’s no way to know exactly what’s going on beneath that statistic, she says. And scientists are still investigating why one protocol was more effective than the other, and what that will mean for future treatments.

But there’s no evidence yet about how long the immunity that mRNA vaccines impart will last. “The advantage of putting it in a viral vector [which AstraZeneca is doing] is that it can cause more enduring and varied immune responses,” Gandhi says.

Another possible advantage of the AstraZeneca vaccine is that it would be much less expensive to produce and distribute, says Gandhi. Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the new vaccine can be stored at a normal refrigerator temperature for up to six months. Both Pfizer and Moderna require much colder conditions and shorter timelines that aren’t as easy to accomplish.

Although the three vaccines differ in approach, they all target the same coronavirus spike protein, which sits on the outside of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and allows it to enter human cells and infect them. And they all have persuasive evidence that they don’t produce negative short-term side effects. “It’s just more and more proof that priming the immune system with the spike protein is leading to immune responses that, if there’s any disease at all, leads to mild disease,” Gandhi says.

AstraZeneca says it could produce three million doses of the vaccine in 2021 if it is approved. Pfizer and Moderna also have roll-out plans for their vaccines. But there are significant questions about how vaccine distribution would work, especially how they would be stored.

“Of course I am thrilled to see any advancement of a vaccine,” says Sue Anne Bell, a University of Michigan nursing professor and disaster response effort. But huge coordination on international, national, and local levels will be required to actually immunize the population. In the United States, she says, “the kind of immunization campaign that we’re thinking about, we haven’t seen in quite some time.”",Why AstraZeneca’s COVID vaccine is an important addition to the fleet of offerings

1 Acorn Squash

Besides serving up a third of the day's fiber, a 1-cup serving of this highly nutritious, naturally sweet veggie contains 30% of your daily vitamin C needs. Here's why Squash Is a Fall Superfood You Need to Add to Your Grocery List ASAP.

2 Apples

This fruit provides one of the best and easiest-to-get sources of fiber. A recent study at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center found that for every 10-gram increase in soluble fiber eaten per day, belly fat was reduced by 3.7% over 5 years. And a study at the University of Western Australia found that the Pink Lady variety had the highest level of antioxidant flavonoids—a fat-burning compound—of any apple. Here are 25 Delicious Apple Recipes you can try!

3 Bananas

This fruit that comes in its own wrapper boosts bloat-fighting bacteria in your stomach and is a prime source of potassium, which can help diminish water retention. Each medium banana contains about 36 grams of good carbs: Their low glycemic index means carbs are slowly released into your body, preventing sugar crashes and spurring muscle recovery. Once you buy bananas, here's a Simple Trick That Keeps Bananas Fresh.

4 Barley

Barley is a terrific appetite suppressant because it contains 6 grams of belly-filling, mostly soluble fiber that has been linked to lowered cholesterol, decreased blood sugars, and increased satiety. It also has tons of health benefits like decreased inflammation and stabilized blood sugar levels.

5 Black Beans

Beans are a great source of protein that includes fiber, which means they keep your blood sugar from spiking and provide the building blocks of muscle growth. One cup of black beans has 12 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber; they're also rich in folate, a B vitamin that stokes muscle growth, and copper, which strengthens tendons. On top of that, a Spanish study showed that consuming four weekly servings of beans or legumes accelerates weight loss. Plus, did you know black beans are The #1 Best Carb To Eat If You're Trying to Lose Weight?

6 Legumes

Lentils, chickpeas, peas, and beans—they're all magic bullets for belly-fat loss. In a study by the American Diabetes Association, it's been proven that legumes aid weight loss more effectively than an equivalent diet that doesn't include them. Those who consumed the legume-rich diet also saw improvements in their ""bad"" LDL cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure. Get started with one of these 29 Healthy Chickpea Recipes That Can Help You Lose Weight.

7 Quinoa

Quinoa is higher in protein than any other grain, and it packs a hefty dose of heart-healthy, unsaturated fats, and B vitamins. Try quinoa in the morning. It has twice the protein of most cereals and fewer carbs.

8 Sweet Potatoes

Sweet potatoes can be called the king of slow carbs because they're digested slowly and keep you feeling fuller and energized longer, plus they are loaded with fiber, nutrients and can help you burn fat. The magic ingredients here are carotenoids, antioxidants that stabilize blood sugar levels and lower insulin resistance, which prevents calories from being converted into fat. And their high vitamin profile (including A, C, and B6) gives you more energy to burn at the gym. So get started with one of these 25 Healthy and Delicious Sweet Potato Recipes.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

9 Tart Cherries

In most of the country, you'll find them dried, frozen, or canned. But they're worth seeking out because they are a true superpower fruit. Animal studies at the University of Michigan have found that tart cherries have the power to reduce belly fat and alter the expression of fat genes.

10 Whole-Wheat Bread

You know brown is better, but do you know why? It's because whole wheat contains three parts of the grain, all nutrient-rich and full of fiber. Just be careful—most bread in the bread aisle is filled with high-fructose corn syrup or a blend of whole and enriched wheat. It's worth splurging on the pricier stuff, often found in the freezer section.

11 Whole-Wheat Pasta

As with whole-wheat bread, you're getting all three parts of the grain, with fiber to increase satiety and prevent overeating. For variety, try pasta made from lentils, chickpeas, black beans, or quinoa; all are full of fiber.

12 Yogurt

Packed with protein and probiotics, a cup of yogurt will satisfy hunger and improve your gut health, a key factor in weight loss. It is also rich in vitamin D and calcium, and it's one of the few foods containing conjugated linoleic acid, a special fat that studies show may reduce body fat. But you need to get the right kind to take advantage of these benefits. Most yogurts are full of sugar and fruity sweeteners.

ESTERO, Fla. — The day they met, Richard Wilbanks and Gunner were inseparable.

Gunner, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, snuggled up right next to Richard that first meeting at the breeder’s place in Miami, and that was all the two needed.

Richard took Gunner home to his wife, Louise, in Estero and the now-famous duo are always side by side whether it’s on the couch or out on the lanai that overlooks a wild nature preserve.

The companionship was put to the ultimate test one Sunday morning in late October as Richard and Gunner went out for a walk by the pond just next to the Wilbanks’ home.

The pair were walking along the shoreline where, unseen to either Richard or Gunner, an alligator was on alert.

In an instant, the almost 4-foot gator lunged from the water and grabbed Gunner. Without any hesitation, Richard lept into the water after the puppy and the gator that had it in its jaws.

The rescue: Florida man saves his dog from the jaws of an alligator; wildlife cam films the dramatic rescue

“It was like a missile,” Richard said recalling the incident. “We were only about 3 feet away from it, but it struck like a snake. It had Gunner in a vise grip and I just rushed in.”

Richard and Louise moved to Estero four years ago.

The couple came by way of central Texas hill country, Louise said. Richard’s son Grant is a landscape architect living in Bonita Springs, so the Wilbanks were familiar with the area and wanted to be close to family.

The pair came to see the house in Estero, but it was under a contract, Richard said. The two went back to Texas and were on their honeymoon when the Realtor called to let them know the house was back on the market. They didn’t hesitate.

“We fell in love with it,” Richard said.

Tucked at the dead-end of their neighborhood, the Wilbanks’ home speaks to their love of nature.

Paintings of seahorses and roseate spoonbills hang in the family room where one of Gunner’s beds lays out in front of the TV. A cross-stitched heron and a large painting of two great egrets watch over the dining table.

Louise said Richard spent four years growing plants in the backyard so the view into the nature preserve was uninterrupted.

Richard said he’s seen deer, turkey, bobcats and even a panther near their home.

“It’s wonderful to be able to share our lives with the wildlife,” he said.

And that positivity even goes for the alligator who grabbed Gunner, too.

“He’s still swimming out there,” Richard said.

Gunner's recovery

Immediately following the attack, Gunner was in shock. Once Richard was able to pry Gunner free, the gator clamped down on his hands and he then had to free himself. The pair traipsed back to the house, both dripping blood.

After a quick home fix on Richard’s hands, Gunner went to the animal hospital where doctors found a puncture wound. The Wilbanks were worried about any internal injuries, but X-rays showed only some water in the lungs. The puppy stayed at the hospital for a few days to recover.

Gunner is just right as rain now, greeting visitors at the door with an energy only puppies can muster, and he has a new leash for his walks.

“A new leash on life,” Richard said.

Gunner and Richard’s harrowing attempt was captured on video because the Florida Wildlife Federation and the fstop Foundation put up cameras to track wildlife in the area.

“I’m pleased with the job they do,” Richard said of FWF. “And this lets people know we can live with wildlife.”

Meredith Budd, the FWF representative in Southwest Florida, said the Wilbanks’ street was very receptive to the cameras.

Overall, 17 cameras across 15 properties are placed in backyards in Estero in what the two organizations call Sharing the Landscape.

“Humans and wildlife, we both inherently share the same landscape and homeowners who live in and around nature should understand the value of wildlife around them,” Budd said. “While this video was shocking and I’m glad everyone was OK, I’m glad it’s a learning opportunity for the importance of respecting wildlife and taking precautions to make sure this doesn’t happen to anyone else.”

The federation checks the cameras, periodically, Budd said, and this was the first time an incident like this showed up.

The cameras only hold a certain number of photos and videos before the memory cards fill up, and they run on batteries, so it’s a bit labor intensive to keep up with them all. Budd said she’d love to get solar power and cloud storage for the cameras, but the funding isn’t there.

Even so, the cameras show the dynamic between people enjoying nature in their backyards and wildlife doing the same.

“It’s interesting seeing the timestamps to see when people are out there, and we are sharing that landscape — just usually not at the same time,” Budd said.

In Southwest Florida, there are wild animals sharing the same spaces humans use, and Budd said it’s important to know what precautions are needed to mitigate risk or conflict.

Richard said for him and Gunner, this was a happy ending story.

His advice: Make sure to leash your dog and keep them 10 feet away from the water.

Sirloin chop. ,https://www.mashed.com/252695/the-is-the-worst-cut-of-pork-you-can-buy/,"This Is The Worst Cut Of Pork You Can Buy

When it comes to pork, the terms and parts can be confusing. Where does that pork butt actually come from? (Hint: it's not the rear — it's actually from right behind the head, via Serious Eats). What is bacon, really? And what's the difference between every cut labeled ""chop""?

It comes down to this: every pork cut comes from one of four main areas: shoulder, belly or side, leg, and loin (via Cook's Illustrated) — and every cut can go by a few different names. But to simplify, shoulder cuts, like pork butt or pork shoulder, are good for slow cooking, like barbecue or roasting. Leg cuts are where we get ham: ham shank, spiral-cut ham, country ham — which you can pull off making yourself. Bacon, that fatty, crispy, gift from the pig gods, is from the belly or side. So are ""spare ribs"" and, duh, pork belly, which is more or less a term for fattier, uncured bacon that had spiked in popularity with foodie-types but apparently lost traction during the pandemic (via Salon and Bloomberg).

Loin cuts are the leanest and maybe the most varied. Many prefer them for their tenderness, and a lot of the ""chop"" varieties we see in the store come from the loin: blade chop, rip chop, center-cut chop. Many ""roast"" and ""rib"" varieties are also from the loin — like the pork loin roast or baby back ribs — yes, the very same, before you spontaneously break out into song. But not just any chop will do.",This Is The Worst Cut Of Pork You Can Buy
"""I read books."" ",https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/elon-musk-spacex-rockets-expert-expertise-books-reading-jim-cantrell.html,"You can become an expert in just about anything if you read enough books on the subject. If you don't believe me, ask Elon Musk. Whenever anyone asks him how he learned to build space-traveling rockets, this is his three-word answer: ""I read books.""

Musk is no rocket scientist, at least not by training. He has a bachelor's degree in economics and another one in physics, and although he got into Stanford's PhD program in energy physics/material science, he dropped out after two days to launch Zip2, a city guide software company that the founders sold to Compaq for $307 million. A few years later he co-founded the company that would become PayPal, which eBay bought for $1.5 billion.

It was at this point, flush with internet millions, that Musk began setting his sights on colonizing Mars. He attempted to buy rockets from the Russians, but they demanded a price even an internet millionaire couldn't afford, and generally refused to take him seriously, according to a profile in Esquire. So Musk told aerospace consultant Jim Cantrell who was working with him that they would build the rockets themselves.

He showed Cantrell his plans, and Cantrell thought, ""I'll be damned -- that's why he's been borrowing all my books."" Musk had been ingesting Cantrell's textbooks on rocket-building and had transformed himself into an expert. ""He knew everything,"" Cantrell told Esquire. ""He'd been planning to build a rocket all along."" And that's how SpaceX was born.

It works even if you're not Elon Musk.

""All right,"" you might argue, ""Musk learned to build rockets by reading books. But he's a genius. Ordinary mortals can't do this."" But they can, at least they with can houses, if not rockets. I know, because my father-in-law, an otherwise unremarkable man who spent most of his adult life working for the Postal Service, did just that.

I never met him; he died a few years before my husband, Bill, and I got together. But Bill remembers how his father (also named Bill) rebuilt the family home piece by piece over the years, reconfiguring it as needed. He brought in fill and raised and leveled the yard. He built on new rooms and added a wheelchair ramp for his granddaughter. When he wasn't rebuilding his own house, he was helping the neighbors renovate theirs. He could have had a successful contracting business if he'd been willing to give up the steady paycheck of a civil servant. Bill senior never took a course -- he just read books about whatever he wanted to do, and then he went and did it.

Want to read your way to success yourself? Begin with a growth mindset -- the belief that your abilities are not fixed in stone but can change over time, and that you can expand and change them if you're willing to put in the effort. It works for Musk: Someone with a bachelor's degree in economics and physics who believes he can learn to build his own rockets has a growth mindset, and then some. Next, if you can, do what Musk did when he hooked up with Cantrell. Find one or more mentors who can advise you and help guide your learning. At the very least, your mentor can help you figure out which books to read to build greater expertise more quickly.

And finally, put that expertise to the test. Dan Coyle, who's written several bestselling books about what makes some individuals, and some teams, more successful than others, recommends spending 30 percent of your time learning and 70 percent testing your newfound knowledge. So, to cement your expertise, test your own knowledge, preferably by trying things out in the real world.","In Just 3 Words, Elon Musk Explained How You Can Become Expert at Anything (Even Rocket Science)"

Formerly known as Grimes, the 32-year-old singer (whose government name is Claire Boucher) just revealed in a new interview that she now goes by “c.”

According to the New York Times, the partner of Elon Musk said her new name is a reference to the speed of light. C welcomed a baby boy, X Æ A-XII Musk, back in May. The nickname for her baby's complicated name is X.

During the new interview, c talked about her 5-month-old son’s unique interests. “I’ve watched ‘Apocalypse Now’ and stuff with my baby,” she said. “He’s into radical art. Like, he just actually is, and I don’t think it’s problematic to engage with them on that level.”

Not only is c introducing her son to media works that others may not deem suitable for a baby, she is creating new content as well for him. Her latest project was an attempt to move X away from traditional infant entertainment. Partnering with the app Endel, the musician created a ""soothing, ambient soundtrack"" in an effort to produce “a better baby sleeping situation.”

“When you have a baby, you’re always using white noise machines. It’s much easier to get them to sleep if you train them on some kind of audio situation,” she explained. “And so I was just like, could this be more artistic? In general, stuff for babies is really just creatively bad. I don’t want your first introduction to the world to just be all this aimless crap.”

The project that was released on Wednesday is titled “AI Lullaby,” and is available on the app for the next eight weeks.

“I’m not insulting babies,” she continued. “I’m just, it’s all very one vibe. I just feel like getting out of the like, ‘Here’s a zebra and a bear in, like, pastel color tones’ energy. That’s just one very small sort of creative lens that things can be looked at through.”

She added that babies “do have taste.""

Shopping baskets. ,https://ca.style.yahoo.com/dirtiest-thing-grocery-store-120030872.html,"Almost one full year into the COVID-19 pandemic, we've all become painstakingly familiar with the best safety protocols recommended by the CDC. From wearing masks to keeping socially distant and frequently washing our hands, the rules have become second nature. We also know a lot more about the virus and how it spreads than we did last spring—such as the risk of catching COVID from food products, food packaging, or grocery shopping bags is low, according to the CDC. Still, if you've yet to be vaccinated, now is not the time to let your guard down at the grocery store or any other public place. In fact, there are some basic hygiene tips you should follow from here on out to keep your chances of picking up unwanted viruses or bacteria extremely low.

For starters, know that one of the most bacteria-packed items in the grocery store is waiting for you the moment you enter the store: The shopping baskets.

The handles of these baskets are frequently touched by other shoppers—and what's more, they're held on to throughout the duration of a grocery shopping trip. So, unlike other oft-touched things—like credit card pads or self-checkout screens—grocery baskets have a higher potential of transferring bacteria from one handler to the next.

Why Grocery Store Baskets Can Be So Dirty

Experts say grocery store basket handles are much less likely to get the regular cleanings that they should—and even when they are disinfected, it's hard to do a thorough job.

""It's almost impossible to wipe off all the surfaces that people might touch,"" says Leann Poston M.D., M.B.A., M.Ed, a consultant for Invigor Medical. ""Baskets are stacked and then used. Even if the baskets were thoroughly cleaned, they might be contaminated when removed. Unlike shopping carts, it is tough to keep your shopping basket away from personal items and clothing.""

Gail Trauco R.N., BSN-OCN, patient advocate and CEO/founder of Medical Bill 911, agrees that cleaning baskets presents particular challenges.

Story continues

""The structure of the baskets—weave and ridged surfaces—create places for [germs] to hide during cleaning. Baskets are disinfected, however, it is impossible for a retailer to clean each crack and crevice,"" she says, pointing out that how baskets are handled also presents sanitary risks. ""You carry the basket on your arm, in your hand, or may change hands. Baskets are more likely to rub against clothing, counters, or product surfaces, spreading contamination.""

A Cleaner Shopping Option

Trauco urges grocery shoppers to skip the baskets and instead opt for a shopping cart (if available). Its handle is much easier to clean with antibacterial wipes—and many grocery stores have tasked associates to wipe them down after each use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Minimizing exposure to surfaces touched while shopping lowers your risk of exposure,"" says Trauco. ""Localize surface exposure to the shopping cart's handle, and place items in your cart without touching additional surfaces.""

Dr. Rashmi Byakodi, a wellness expert at Best for Nutrition, echoes these points, saying: ""It's better to use a cart as you can just sanitize the handle before use.""

Once you're done shopping and have checked out, make sure you return the shopping cart to a designated area for returned carts (if there is one). And then, immediately apply hand sanitizer to your hands—The CDC advises the use of hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol each time you touch a surface.

Even when the pandemic is over, keeping these tips in mind will keep you safe—and bacteria, viruses, and germs at bay—when you're at the store.

You will be safe. ,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-trump-presidential-debate-voters-lee-carter,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Thursday night is the last chance President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have to make their case on the debate stage. And while the microphones can now be muted, there's one message they must still get across: with me, you will be safe.

Here's why those four words are so important and mean so much.

No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, you likely feel the same emotion right now: fear. And more than anything, we need to be reassured.

We need to know that it’s all going to be OK. That we can wake up after the election is decided, breathing a long-needed sigh of relief.

DOUG SCHOEN: BIDEN'S AHEAD IN POLLS — BUT SO WAS HILLARY CLINTON. CAN TRUMP STILL WIN?

And so, for both Trump and Biden, the message must be the same. But what it means coming for each of them will be totally different. Let's start with the president and then move on to the Democratic presidential nominee.

For Trump, he must convince us that as individuals we will be safe. We want a politician at the helm that will protect us from big, bureaucratic government. Give us the tools and let us make the decisions that are right for each of us and our families.

-Protect my money. I work hard for it. I don’t want to give it to the government and have them decide how to spend it. Keep my taxes as low as possible.

-Protect my freedom of speech. I want to be able to say what I want to post what I want and worship the way I want. I want to share my opinions free from judgment.

-Protect my right to bear arms. I’m scared of what might happen and I want the right to protect my home and family.

-Protect my community and city. I want a police force that can do their job.

-Protect my jobs. I know times are hard. I have heard politicians say that jobs aren’t coming back to the USA. Prove them wrong.

-Protect this economy. When you took office, everyone said the stock market would tank. The economy would be in shambles, and yet I feel better today than I did four years ago even with a pandemic. Keep this economy going. And whatever you do, don’t shut down the economy again. I couldn’t take it.

-Protect my vote. Mail-in ballots leave room for fraud. I believe the system could be rigged against me. Let’s vote the old-fashioned way to make sure that every vote that is counted is legitimate.

-Protect my dreams and my opportunity. I might be struggling now, but I want the American dream to be there. I want to be wealthy. I want unlimited opportunities and I don’t want to apologize for it.

For Biden, he must convince us that our institutions and our government will be safe.

We want a politician at the helm who restores a sense of order to the chaos. We want to trust that the system works for all of us and protects us when we need it. We want it to work for all Americans, not just a few.

-Protect us from COVID. Follow the science. Require masks. Do whatever it takes. We can’t fight COVID alone. This is exactly what a strong and healthy government is designed to do.

-Protect our health care system. From public health to my medical care, we have a right to health care.

-Protect us from greed. We are tired of putting profits before people on issues from climate change to basic regulation, let’s just do what’s right.

-Protect equality. It’s unfair that the wealthy get wealthier while everyone else struggles. Let’s create a tax structure that benefits those less fortunate and taxes those who can most afford it.

-Protect us from wrongs. From systemic racism to systemic inequality, we want all people treated fairly.

-Protect our image around the world. I used to be proud to be an American no matter where I went. Today, I am embarrassed. Please, restore our reputation overseas.

-Protect my vote. I believe voter interference is real. I worry about foreign interference in the election. I also worry about what’s happening here at home. I want to know that my vote will be counted.

-Protect our institutions. I want to trust the CDC. The Supreme Court. The FBI. National Security. Protect the office of the presidency itself. Protect us from the crazy. More than anything, I want to turn on the news and be bored. Restore order to the office.

One thing is clear, Americans everywhere are afraid. And with so many good reasons.

What is going to assuage our fears depends on the way we view the world.

Chick-fil-A. ,https://thetakeout.com/chick-fil-a-has-the-best-drive-thru-in-america-say-cus-1845308261,"When you pull up to the drive-thru, there are a lot of factors at play, both seen and unseen. You’ll remember, for example, if a place forgets to add your side of fries; you might even curse them until your dying day. But you probably won’t remember much about a successful drive-thru pickup, because those are designed to be uneventful. Fast food places want you to focus on what counts: the meal. And now, with new data on all the elements that make a fast-food drive-thru experience great, QSR Magazine has the official ranking of the best ones in America as part of its larger Drive-Thru Study.

Market research firm Food Service Results analyzed the customer satisfaction ratings from 1,007 drive-thru users at 17 different major fast food chains across the United States. Some of the metrics are things you’ve probably been frustrated by at one time or another, like order accuracy and speed of service, but it goes deeper than that: have you given much thought to things like the cleanliness of a drive-thru lane, or the availability of various menu items? This new ranking takes all those considerations (and more) into account and averages them for an “Overall Experience” score. Chick-fil-A scored highest with 93 points, and ranked highest in every individual category except one: menu item availability. This is slightly surprising, since it seems like Chick-fil-A is already working off a more limited menu than the other chains and would thus be more likely to have everything in stock. (I mean, it’s mostly just chicken, right?)

The number-two drive-thru pick was a rather close second behind Chick-fil-A, and it is my great pleasure to reveal that it was Arby’s. Yes, we all use Arby’s as our pop cultural punching bag, but it actually outranked Chick-fil-A in menu item availability, and nearly matched it in the areas of speed of service and the quality of menu items. Culver’s, Panera, and Dunkin’ round out the top five.

The lowest ranking drive-thru on the list, whose metrics hover in the low 80s and high 70s, is Popeyes. Its speed, friendliness, and cleanliness were lowest rated, but both the quality and accuracy of the items ordered netted a high 85 ranking. I guess it’s hard to mess up orders when everyone just demands the beloved chicken sandwich 100% of the time.",And the best drive-thru in America is...
"First will be: health-care workers, emergency responders, people with underlying conditions, and older adults living in group settings. ",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/who-is-first-in-line-coronavirus-vaccine,"Whenever a new vaccine gets approved, health officials have to tackle the difficult question of who should be first in line to receive it. Typically health-care workers are first, and in previous outbreaks, such as the H1N1 swine flu in 2009, people whose health was most vulnerable got priority, too.

With the widely anticipated COVID-19 vaccine, there’s a new factor being considered: fairness.

On October 2, the National Academy of Medicine revealed its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine distribution in an influential 237-page framework commissioned by the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The report proposes distributing a vaccine in four phases as it becomes available. The first recipients are obvious picks: health-care workers, emergency responders, people with underlying conditions, and older adults living in group settings. This mirrors similar recommendations by the World Health Organization, and it is a foundational principle for the COVAX collaboration, a global effort to improve poorer countries’ access to a vaccine, which 171 nations have pledged to join. (The U.S. is not one of them, and a small group of scientists question the wisdom of putting some health-care workers at the top.)

But for the first time in history, the report also recommends that priority be given to people who score high on the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index, which identifies factors such as poverty, lack of access to transportation, or crowded housing that are linked to poor health outcomes. The committee of virologists, epidemiologists, economists, and other health researchers who wrote the report said the goal is to rectify the pandemic’s disproportionate burden on minorities and poor people and “work toward a new commitment to promoting health equity.”

The disparities are stark: Compared with white people, African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans are nearly three times more likely to contract the coronavirus. Blacks are twice as likely to die.

“This approach allowed us to embrace a notion of equal regard for all people, and address the underpinnings of social inequity and factors that have landed African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans in situations and occupations in which they are less healthy,” committee member Jewel Mullen, associate dean for health equity at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin, tells National Geographic.

Despite the report’s nuanced guidelines, it’s not clear how they will be practiced or enforced, nor how they will play out as the country prepares for an unprecedented vaccine rollout.

Next in line

The highly contagious nature of COVID-19 is forcing officials to consider social criteria—such as protecting people living in group housing or working in conditions in which transmission is more likely—when deciding who gets the vaccine first.

The report authors are recognizing the vital roles of essential workers, such as teachers, bus drivers, and grocery stockers, on whom the rest of us depend.

The second phase of the recommended rollout would include the remaining adults older than 65, K–12 teachers, school staff, and childcare workers—as well as essential workers in industries such as meatpacking that don’t allow social distancing. Residents and staff of group homes, homeless shelters, prisons, and detention centers also fit into this category.

Children, young adults under 30, and other critical workers at increased risk are in the third group. The fourth wave includes everyone else residing in the U.S.

It’s very short-sighted to think we can get this thing behind us if we just take care of our own.

Now that it’s been submitted, the report will be considered by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a nongovernmental organization that makes public policy recommendations on the use of licensed vaccines to the CDC. While ACIP’s suggestions aren’t binding, they’re usually adopted.

“These won’t be rigid recommendations. We need some flexibility,” says Jose Romero, ACIP committee chair and Secretary of Health for the state of Arkansas.

That’s because health-care regulators want to avoid some of the pitfalls encountered when they prepared for a vaccination campaign during the H1N1 flu pandemic, which killed more than 12,000 people in the U.S. At that time, counties geared up for distribution of the vaccine to the first priority group, but the shipments arrived so slowly that the threat had passed by the time they received large quantities. Historically, when supplies are limited, mass vaccination can be successfully replaced with an approach that targets those most at-risk, but the shortage wasn’t anticipated in time.

“It came in dribs and drabs, and each state got a couple thousand doses at first,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Romero acknowledges that individual states or counties might have vulnerable populations, such as workers in local meatpacking plants, whom they want to focus on after receiving early vaccine shipments in a second phase.

What is fair?

Romero says that both the ACIP and the National Academy of Medicine are “aligned” in their mission to promote health equity, but that ACIP is waiting to learn which vaccines will be approved before issuing final guidelines.

“Our recommendations will probably change over time, as each version comes forward and we learn about its efficacy,” Romero says. “Maybe one doesn’t work as well in the elderly, so we would focus it on younger people.”

There’s already precedent for using fairness considerations to determine priority for other health-care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

When supplies of remdesivir—the experimental antiviral drug that President Donald Trump partially credits for his recent recovery—were in short supply in June, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center implemented a weighted lottery system for patients. The hospital had enough for only about one in four patients, but those from disadvantaged backgrounds received a roughly one in three chance of being selected. So did health-care and essential workers in jobs that have a higher risk of infection.

(Related: Who infected President Trump? This genetics tool could easily pinpoint the source.)

Administrators didn’t make distinctions based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, ability to pay, or whether someone had children to care for. Rather, they used a metric called the “area deprivation index,” a database developed by the University of Wisconsin that incorporates more than a dozen census variables, including income, education, and housing.

“If you’re suffering from the disadvantages of poverty and poor access to health care and jobs that put you historically at a higher risk of dying, then we’re going to take some steps to lessen the disadvantage you’re experiencing,” explains Douglas White, director of the program on ethics and decision-making in critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. He says that the model could be used for future drug shortages, such as convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies.

Frozen logistics?

At the same time, state and county local health departments are balancing these recommendations with preparations for how to distribute whatever vaccine doses become available. Last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that the U.S. government was manufacturing six potential vaccines in 23 facilities and would have 100 million doses ready by the end of the year and enough for every American by spring.

Without thoughtful planning, logistical challenges with this huge deployment could create disparities in access to this life-saving remedy. Two frontrunner candidates—by the biotech company Moderna and the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer—require two doses spaced about a month apart and are chemically unstable at room temperature. As a consequence, those drugs must be shipped and stored frozen, and Pfizer’s version, moreover, must be kept at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, which is colder than standard freezers.

That’s why both the WHO and the National Academy report list vaccine storage and transport as crucial elements for equitable vaccine distribution. Vaccine shortages are already a problem for rural America due to years of hospital closures, and the mere lack of refrigerators has stymied efforts to eliminate diseases around the world for decades. To help with shipping, UPS is building two huge freezer farms in Kentucky and the Netherlands that will contain 600 deep freezers that would store 48,000 vaccine vials. Another option is a vaccine—such as Johnson & Johnson’s candidate—that can be administered in a single dose and does not require cold storage. But it’s a couple months behind in the vaccine race.

(Related: Dozens of COVID-19 vaccines are in development. Here are the ones to follow.)

Health regulators are also trying to anticipate how many supplies, such as syringes, including adult and child sizes, to stockpile and whether they need to train additional people to administer the shots, especially for a two-dose vaccine. HHS officials have stated that the U.S. alone could require 650 million to 850 million syringes and needles, and that it could take two years to manufacture them.

“It’s not just the science of vaccine development we need to think about, but what it’s going to take to get it to the people who need it,” says Nuzzo of Johns Hopkins.

What’s also unknown is whether vaccine shipments will arrive in manageable waves so they can be distributed through the doctor’s offices and pharmacies used for seasonal flu shots—or whether officials would need to find larger spaces like stadiums.

Unlike influenza, the threat of COVID-19 won’t fade, given that nine in 10 people remain susceptible to infection. And the challenges of distributing this vaccine could be unlike any other, says medical historian Howard Markel of the University of Michigan.

It’s like we’re in the middle of a war and everyone needs a Kevlar vest.

“A lot of vaccination programs weren’t done in the middle of the worst pandemic of our generation,” says Markel. “It’s like we’re in the middle of a war and everyone needs a Kevlar vest.”

Many legacy vaccines were mass produced after outbreaks were over. One exception is the polio vaccine, but it required an epic effort to scale up quickly. The Eisenhower Administration licensed six different companies for polio vaccination campaigns in 1954, and then used assembly lines at high school gymnasiums, civic centers, and dance halls to produce them.

Global public health experts are also asking wealthy countries to consider COVID-19 vaccines as a “global public good” and to earmark funding and doses for another needy group: poorer countries.

Not only can unvaccinated travelers continue to spread the virus, our national interests depend on healthy foreign populations maintaining global supply chains, says Ruth Faden, bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and member of the international organization’s COVID-19 vaccine working group.

“Wealthy countries are focusing primarily on securing vaccines for their own populations,” Faden says. “But it’s very short-sighted to think we can get this thing behind us if we just take care of our own.”

Yet as the world waits for a vaccine winner to hammer out the details, the emphasis on equity by health officials is meant to reassure people.

“It’s an important message to present to the public,” Mullen from the University of Texas says, “that there's a deliberate body thinking about how to advance the vaccine in a process that’s fair to all of us.”",Who will get the vaccine first? Here's where you might land in line.
It won't be in the Master Chief Collection. ,https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/xbox-halo-5-not-coming-to-master-chief-collection/,"✖

Halo: The Master Chief Collection has proven to be an excellent option for newcomers to the franchise and older fans alike. However, those hoping to see Halo 5: Guardians added to the collection are out of luck. Developer 343 Industries has once again confirmed that there are no plans to add the game to the overall compilation. In a new blog post, 343 Industries stated that Halo 4 ""is the last Halo title we currently have planned for the collection (sorry to crush your Halo 5 in MCC dreams), so let's finish strong!"" For now, that means fans will have to stick with the version available on Xbox One.

It's worth noting that the use of the word ""currently"" does leave the door open for a future addition to the compilation. That likely won't come in time for players looking to get caught up on the series before the release of Halo Infinite, however, particularly those playing on PC, as Halo 5 has yet to make its way to the platform.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection is a compilation that features remastered games from the series, as well as additional content. Interestingly enough, the compilation does include the beta for Halo 5's multiplayer, despite the fact that the game itself will not be included. The Master Chief Collection originally released on Xbox One in 2014, and 343 Studios has continued to add new games and patches to the collection over the last few years. The compilation also released on PC last year, and games have slowly been made available, since. Cross-play between the two versions is currently unavailable, but the feature is coming sometime in the future.

The news might be a bit disappointing, but Halo fans have had a bit of a rough year, in that regard. Halo Infinite was set to release alongside the Xbox Series X/S this year, but the game has been pushed back to a 2021 release window. Fortunately, fans will have Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo 5: Guardians to play on the next-gen platform to keep them busy, in the meantime. Just don't expect to see the latter on PC anytime soon.

"South Dakota, in an attempt to simultaneously legalize medical and recreational marijuana. ",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/04/this-state-will-make-marijuana-history-in-november/,"There are expected to be a number of fast-growing trends this decade, including cloud computing, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. But don't sleep on marijuana.

After generating an estimated $10.9 billion in worldwide sales in 2018, legal channel cannabis sales are expected to hit anywhere from $50 billion to $200 billion a year by 2030, according to various Wall Street estimates. Yes, this is a pretty wide range, but it's to be expected of an industry that's never been legalized in the modern era, and which has tens of billions of dollar in activity occurring behind the scenes.

It's also an industry that could soon get a lot bigger in the United States. Currently, two-thirds of all states have given the green light to medical marijuana, with 11 of these states also allowing for the consumption and/or retail sale of adult-use weed. But in less than a month, we could see these figures tick higher.

The Nov. 3 election will feature five states with cannabis measures on their respective ballots. However, none is going to be more unique than what the Mount Rushmore State is presenting to its residents.

The Mount Rushmore State is four weeks away from making cannabis history

While we've witnessed a number of unlikely ballot measures before, South Dakota is about to do something no state has previously attempted: It's trying to legalize medical and recreational marijuana at the same time, albeit with two separate ballot measures.

First up, Mount Rushmore State voters will have to weigh in on Measure 26, which would establish a medical marijuana industry in the state for patients with predefined debilitating medical conditions. The measure would allow qualifying patients to possess up to three ounces of cannabis, as well as grow at least three cannabis plants at their residence, as prescribed by a physician.

Initially, Measure 26 would include severe nausea, seizures, and severe or persistent muscle spasms among the list of qualifying debilitating medical conditions. However, South Dakota's Department of Health would be free to add to the list of qualifying conditions upon passage of the measure.

Secondly, South Dakotans will also being voting on Constitutional Amendment A, which would legalize recreational marijuana throughout the state. Pretty much in-line with what we've seen in other adult-use-legal states, South Dakota will establish a legal age for consumption and possession of 21, and (more specific to the state) will assign a 15% tax rate on weed sales.

What's interesting about the recreational legalization measure is that it doesn't establish a medical marijuana program or provide hemp guidelines in the state. This means the South Dakota State Legislature would be responsible coming up with the rules and regulations governing a medical cannabis and hemp industry by or before April 1, 2022.

Considering that we have no precedent of a state jumping from wholly illicit to recreationally legal, I'm not certain Amendment A will pass. But favorability toward medical marijuana is high (pardon the pun), making passage of Measure 26 fairly likely.

Four other states will join South Dakota on Election Day

In addition to South Dakota, four other states will by vying to go green.

The only currently illicit state (other than South Dakota) that's attempting to legalize medical marijuana is Mississippi. The Magnolia State has a two-part cannabis question on its ballot that'll require residents to first assess their palatability to medical marijuana, and secondly choose which type of medical cannabis program they prefer. Initiative 65 is a more traditional program that allows physicians to prescribe cannabis for 20 qualifying conditions. Meanwhile, Initiative 65A restricts the smoking of medical marijuana to patients with terminal illnesses and provides increased regulatory oversight.

The other three states – New Jersey, Arizona, and Montana – are all voting on recreational pot initiatives.

New Jersey was the first state to get a measure firmly on the ballot for the November election. Polling has suggested that Public Question 1 has a good chance to pass. As a reminder, New Jersey's legislature was very close to waving the green flag on recreational weed in early 2019, but was ultimately derailed by social measures. Residents will instead get to decide the Garden State's fate in a little over four weeks.

Similar to New Jersey, Arizona seems to have an above-average opportunity to legalize adult-use cannabis. Arizona narrowly voted down Proposition 205 in Nov. 2016 (48.7% in favor), which would have legalized recreational weed in the Grand Canyon State. History has shown that the second time is the charm when it comes to recreational legalization measures.

Montanans will also have two measures they'll be voting on, both of which work toward the same goal. Montana Cl-118, if passed, would allow the states' constitution to be amended, making 21 the legal age of cannabis purchase, use, and possession. Then there's I-190, the actual adult-use pot measure that would impose a 20% tax rate if passed. Of the three recreational-only votes, Montana should be the most closely contested.

U.S. multistate operators should have a field day

No matter what happens with the presidency come Nov. 3, there's a very good chance the number of legalized recreational and/or medical marijuana states will increase. With the federal government maintaining a hands-off approach to regulation (i.e., allowing states to regulate their own pot industries), U.S. multistate operators (MSO) appear primed to have a field day in 2021.

In particular, some of the largest publicly traded MSOs are in great shape to benefit from new legalizations and ongoing organic expansion in legalized states. For instance, Curaleaf ( CURLF -2.15% ) recently closed its acquisition of Grassroots, which has increased its operating retail locations to 93, and bumped up its presence to 23 states. Curaleaf has an existing presence in New Jersey, and looks to be on track to hit $1 billion in full-year sales by 2021.

Green Thumb Industries ( GTBIF -2.56% ) will also see a bump-up in sales, but not solely because of newly legalized states. Though Green Thumb has a presence in New Jersey, it's Nevada and Illinois that can be even more lucrative markets from an organic growth perspective. Green Thumb currently has 48 open dispensaries, but holds enough licenses to double this figure.

Investors often love to follow the money to big gains -- and it's pretty evident that, when it comes to marijuana stocks, the U.S. is where the green will be freely flowing.",This State Will Make Marijuana History in November
Mondays. ,https://www.eatthis.com/worst-day-eat-chain-restaurant/,"When you have a hankering for Olive Garden breadsticks or just can't wait to enjoy some appetizers while you sip on drinks during happy hour at Applebee's, it can be hard to wait in a long line to satisfy those cravings. Even worse, the day you choose to eat at a restaurant can even impact how much money you pay and how fresh your meal will be.

Yes, there really is a bad day to dine out! (If you happen to stay in and cook a meal for yourself, be sure you're trying out the 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time.)

Weekends are typically the busiest time for restaurants, which might make you think Saturday or Sunday is the worst day to dine out. But as it turns out, because weekends are so busy, many restaurants keep an all-star team ready to handle the rush. Also, restaurants often get deliveries of fresh products on Thursdays and/or Fridays in preparation for a busy weekend.

As such, your food will likely be better prepared and fresher if you dine on the weekend, although you might have to wait a bit longer to be seated and you'll likely miss out on savings like happy hour and lunch specials, as these are often weekday promotions to lure in more business. Looking for more helpful tips? Your ultimate restaurant and supermarket survival guide is here!

With that in mind, which day of the week should you always steer clear of chain restaurants?

Mondays, a dreaded day for many people, is actually the worst day of the week to eat at a chain restaurant. The first food delivery of the week for many restaurants is actually Tuesday, so you'll be eating food that isn't as fresh as you may hope. You might still find a long wait, too, as people opt to dine out after a long day right after the weekend.

One restaurant employee explained on Quora about the best day to order fish, ""I would still avoid fish in many restaurants on a Monday because, it's generally when the 'B' team is on. Again from a personal perspective, my restaurants will average 500 a day Friday to Sunday, so we have the top guys in the kitchen. Monday is a 180 cover day.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

If nothing else, even the vibe can be off for diners and staff on a Monday. According to Shoes for Crews Europe, a slip-resistant shoe brand for restaurant workers, ""Most studies and reports from other restaurant owners say that the slowest restaurant days are Mondays and Tuesdays. The social suggestion is, then, that most people are feeling too tired and are suffering from post-weekend blues to consider going out to eat on Monday and Tuesday nights.""

So if you can stick it out another day, skip dining out on Monday to ensure a fresher meal. And in case you want to know which day is actually the best to dine out, we uncovered that for you, too.",The Worst Day of the Week to Eat at a Restaurant — Eat This Not That

"A $12,000 backpack. ",https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/kylie-jenner-sends-her-daughter-152840423.html,"In The Know by Yahoo

Stormi Webster is old enough to go to school. Feel old yet?

She’s also old enough to bring a designer bag to said school. Feel poor yet?

The daughter of beauty mogul Kylie Jenner and rapper Travis Scott went to her first day of home school wearing a $12,000 backpack, and the response from fans was a resounding “can’t relate!”

Jenner shared a video of Stormi jumping up and down in her driveway wearing the designer accessory.

“First day of school! First day of school!” the toddler exclaimed in the clip.

It’s no surprise that Jenner has quite the collection of Hermes items, specifically ultra-expensive Birkin bags, but seeing a 2-year-old swinging around an item that costs more than a down payment for a house is always a bit shocking.

“I guarantee Stormi would have picked a ‘Frozen” Jansport backpack rather than a 12k Hermès one if she had the choice,” one Twitter user wrote.

“First day of homeschool and Stormi got her Kelly backpack on, I hate being poor,” another said.

“Stormi’s backpack alone could probably help me pay off some loans,” a third joked.

Jenner has come under fire in the past for giving her daughter lavish gifts.

In 2018, she shared a video of her then-1-year-old daughter wearing a diamond ring fans assumed she gave her for Christmas. She’s also reportedly bought Stormi a $1,000 Prada bag and a $200,000 pony. Let’s not forget all those lavish birthday parties, either.

Our faces. ,https://www.inverse.com/science/dogs-dont-like-your-face,"There are few things more relaxing than staring deeply into the eyes of your canine companion, but a new study suggests dogs might not be as into our faces as we are into theirs.

Humans and primates have a demonstrated love for faces — so much so that we've evolved a whole section of our brains to process both human and non-human faces. But while previous research suggests dogs can hold eye contact and even read our emotions via our facial expressions, researchers hadn't tested whether dogs' brains were wired to prefer faces in the same way as humans'.

Now, we know. Unlike humans, primates, and even tortoises, dogs' brains react the same to a face as they do to the back of someone's head.

But don't worry: The human-dog love story isn't dead. This result may actually mean dogs love you no matter how you might look to anyone or anything else.

In the study, which was published Monday in the journal JNeurosci, researchers scanned both human and dog volunteers' brains using fMRI.

Family dogs in Hungary and Mexico were recruited for these fMRI studies. Enik Kubinyi / Eötvös Loránd University

The study was conducted across two labs — one in Hungary, and one in Mexico. The Hungary lab scanned only humans, while the Mexico lab took on the dogs and human participants. To ensure the dogs already had familiarity with human faces, the pooches recruited were all family dogs. In total, the researchers studied 30 humans and 20 dogs.

The researchers traced brain function data while both the human participants and the canine participants watched short videos of either: human faces, dog faces, the back of a human's head, or the back of a dog's head. The faces shown were neutral in expression and, in the case of human faces, didn't feature any piercings or heavy makeup. To ensure that the dogs didn't feel threatened, the dogs and humans on-screen looked away from the camera.

After completing several scans over several days, the researchers analyzed how similar — or different — the humans and dogs' brain responses appeared.

Not a face fan — Surprisingly, the researchers found dogs' brains don't have a specialized area that responds to faces, whether they be of the human or canine variety. In fact, dogs demonstrate no preference between viewing the back of a human or dog's head versus their face.

But the dogs did seem to prefer looking at other dogs as opposed to humans. This was actually something they shared with the human cohort — they too preferred their own species' faces.

But the humans' preference for any face (human or canine) was stronger than their preference for other body parts (in this case, the back of a human head). This is the inverse of what the researchers discovered about the dogs. They appear to prefer their own species first (either the front of the face or the back of the head), and not any human face.

Once in the fMRI, both dogs and humans watched a rotation of videos showing human and dog faces. Enik Kubinyi / Eötvös Loránd University

In a statement accompanying the study, first author and researcher at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Nóra Bunford said these differences are important for planning future — and interpreting past — canine research.

""[This] demonstrates that there can be substantial dissimilarities in cortical specialization for face perception across mammals,"" explains Bunford. ""These findings also shed new light on previous dog fMRI studies claiming to have found 'face areas:' we now think that the stronger activity to dog faces in those studies indicated dog-preferring rather than face-preferring brain areas.""

Lost love? — While our pets' brains may not be wired to prefer our faces, previous research has demonstrated that pet pooches do recognize and even love their owners. Our pets may also be demonstrating their preference for us through other sensory means, like our scent or the sound of our voice.

Moral of the story? Man's best friend doesn't care what you look like and they love you all the same.

Abstract: Conspecific-preference in social perception is evident for multiple sensory modalities and in many species. There is also a dedicated neural network for face processing in primates. Yet, the evolutionary origin and the relative role of neural species-sensitivity and face-sensitivity in visuo-social processing are largely unknown. In this comparative study, species- and face sensitivity to identical visual stimuli (videos of human and dog faces and occiputs) were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging in dogs (n=20; 45% female) and humans (n=30; 50% female). In dogs, the bilateral mid suprasylvian gyrus showed conspecific-preference, no regions exhibited face-preference, and the majority of the visually responsive cortex showed greater conspecific- than face-preference. In humans, conspecific preferring regions (the right amygdala/hippocampus and the posterior superior temporal sulcus) also showed face-preference, and much of the visually-responsive cortex showed greater face- than conspecific-preference. Multivariate pattern analyses identified species sensitive regions in both species, but face-sensitive regions only in humans. Across-species representational similarity analyses revealed stronger correspondence between dog and human response patterns for distinguishing con- from heterospecific faces than other contrasts. Results unveil functional analogies in dog and human visuo-social processing of conspecificity but suggest that cortical specialization for face perception may not be ubiquitous across mammals.",Dogs surprisingly don't care about 1 part of the body as much as we thought
Breakfast. ,https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/healthiest-fast-food-chain-taco-bell/,"While you might not normally equate fast food with wholesome eating, there are actually options you can get from the drive-thru that are on the healthier side. With menu items like the Crunchwrap Supreme and $1 Nacho Fries (or Buffalo Chicken Nacho Fries), it may come as a surprise that Taco Bell offers up some of the healthiest options on the fast food scene. Dig a little deeper into their menu and you’ll find that there are some better-for-you options if you don’t have time to make a homemade meal. (Have time on your hands? Try these fiesta-worthy recipes for tacos, fajitas and more.)

Over the past several years, Taco Bell has positioned themselves as one of the best fast food chains for healthy food, making strides to offer customizable options across their menu for their health-conscience customers.

According to the nutrition page on their website, these are some of the quality improvements they’ve made over the past few years to their menu:

Reduced sodium across the menu by 15 percent since 2008, with a push to have a total 25 percent reduction by 2025.

Removed artificial flavors and colors and replaced them with natural alternatives.

Source 100% cage-free eggs for our breakfast menu. 100% cage-free egg ingredients were introduced to the menu in 2018.

Serve chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine in U.S. restaurants

While these options and improvements are great, and definitely a step toward healthier eating, it’s largely up to the customer to customize smart choices, like ordering vegetarian or vegan options, or calorie-cutting with their ‘Fresco’ option to remove cheese, rice, sour cream, and add in pico de gallo.

“We just really encourage people to customize to however it fits their lifestyle,” Missy Schaaphok, Taco Bell’s in-house nutritionist and dietitian told Business Insider in 2016.

"""This outbreak will end."" ",https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dr-fauci-just-said-4-130829177.html,"It feels like we're at another turning point with the COVID pandemic. After weeks of declining coronavirus case numbers nationwide, we've had a change of luck and cases are now climbing in 32 states across the U.S., The New York Times reports. But it's not all bad news, according to Anthony Fauci, MD. In a conversation with Wired editor at large Steven Levy published on Sept. 30, Fauci actually sounded optimistic, particularly when discussing the COVID vaccine. In fact, Fauci said the positive words you've likely been waiting to hear: ""This outbreak will end.""

He added, ""We will get a vaccine. And then if we combine a vaccine with prudent public health measures, we can put this outbreak behind us.""

Levy told Fauci that he's among the majority of Americans who are suspicious that a vaccine might be rushed before the November election. That statistic he's referring to is likely from a Sept. 17 poll out of the Pew Research Center, which found that 77 percent of Americans believe a vaccine would be approved before it could be proven safe and effective and 78 percent believe the process is moving too quickly. As a result, only 21 percent of American adults surveyed said they definitely plan to get the vaccine, a drastic drop from May when 42 percent said they would get vaccinated.

Work on vaccine against virus

""The fear is understandable, but if I give you the facts, I hope that you would see it's not reasonable,"" Fauci said, adding he has full confidence in the process. ""The way the system is set up, there [are] independent bodies that have access to the data that no one else has access to. And they make the decision based on the scientific data, whether the vaccine is safe and effective."" This Data and Safety Monitoring Board, made up of clinicians, vaccinologists, statisticians, and ethicists, are ""the only ones … who intermittently look at the data and they can come to any of a number of conclusions.""

With five vaccines now in the final stage of trials, Fauci reiterated the vaccine timeline he's previously discussed. He believes ""it is likely that we will know whether we have a safe and effective vaccine somewhere around November and December."" He added there will be about 100 million doses by the end of the year for those who need it most, and up to 700 million doses by the end of April for the rest of the population.

Fauci has been trying to regain the public's confidence in regards to a coronavirus vaccine for the past few weeks. In an interview with Vox reporter Sean Rameswaram on Sept. 25, he said, ""Everybody is worrying that someone is going to make an end run around that and try to get a vaccine out for political reasons. Well, that will not happen, but if it does … it will be really transparent. Because the scientists will see the data. The FDA has pledged publicly multiple times that they will not approve a vaccine unless they've established that nonpolitical scientists agree that it's safe and effective.""

Similarly, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival on Sept. 29, Fauci said, ""I feel cautiously optimistic, as a scientist, that we will have a safe and effective vaccine. I believe it will happen, and it will happen likely by this end of the calendar year.""

But in his conversation with Wired, Fauci made clear that the prospect of a vaccine isn't the only reason he's optimistic. Simply put, he says looking on the bright side is the only way to get through this pandemic.

""We should not despair, 'cause despair makes you throw your hands up and say, 'It doesn't matter what I do, what's going to happen is going to happen,'"" Fauci said. ""That is incorrect. It does matter what we do. And if we do it for a while longer, we will look behind us and the outbreak will be behind us, not among us.""

"Over $300,000. ",https://www.vice.com/en/article/ep4eme/bombshell-report-shows-how-much-trump-paid-in-taxes-to-foreign-governments,"The year he was elected to the White House, President Donald Trump paid just $750 in taxes to the IRS. During the same period, he paid foreign governments over $300,000 in taxes, leading many to question his claim of putting “America first.”

The details of Trump’s tax filings have been published for the first time in a bombshell report in the New York Times, which details the president’s tax filings for the last two decades. The report not only lays bare Trump’s tax-avoidance schemes but also exposes the potential conflict of interest created by the president’s continued business involvements in some of the world’s geopolitical hotspots.

The documents reveal the Trump organization as a network of hundreds of companies whose losses Trump uses to pay virtually no income tax.

In 2016, the year he won the presidency, Trump also paid just $750 in taxes and in 10 of the previous 15 years, Trump paid $0 in personal income taxes.

Trump managed to reduce his U.S. income taxes despite generating hundreds of millions in revenue from the NBC reality show “The Apprentice,” and from endorsements and property investments, through accounting practices that helped him write off huge losses at many of his other companies.

But when it came to paying taxes on his overseas earnings, Trump appears to have been much less concerned about limiting his liability.

When Trump became president, he said he would pursue no new foreign deals while in office, but that didn’t stop him raking in significant revenue from the overseas deals he already had in place.

In his first two years in the White House, his revenue from abroad totaled $73 million, the Times reports. While much of that is from golf properties in Ireland and Scotland, it also includes deals in countries with strongmen leaders that Trump has openly praised, such as Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Narendra Modi in India, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey.

During 2016 and 2017, Trump earned $3 million in licensing deals in the Philippines, $2.3 million from similar deals in India, and $1 million in Turkey from putting his name on two towers.

The records obtained by the Times show that Trump reported paying taxes on a number of his overseas ventures. In 2017, Trump’s $750 U.S. tax payment was dwarfed by the $15,598 he or his companies paid in Panama, $145,400 in India, and $156,824 in the Philippines.

But the continued revenue stream from these countries also created conflicts for Trump while in the Oval Office.

In the Philippines, Duterte appointed the businessman behind the Trump tower in Manila as a special trade envoy to Washington.

Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, who helped Trump secure a licensing deal in Istanbul in 2008 that has so far netted the president $13 million, was appointed as chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council and regularly lobbied U.S. government officials.

When relations between Istanbul and Washington deteriorated, a Turkish business group canceled a conference at Trump’s Washington hotel, but rescheduled the event six months later when relations had improved.

The deal in Istanbul, which involved two Trump-branded towers, is under scrutiny for another reason, as it involved huge consulting fees of almost $2 million paid to an unknown consultant.

A source with knowledge of the deal in Istanbul told the Times there was never any third-party consultant involved.

The payment of large consulting fees was a tactic Trump employs often: between 2010 and 2018, the president wrote off some $26 million in unexplained “consulting fees” as a business expense across nearly all of his projects.

Advertisement

The Times linked the payment of some of those consulting fees to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, suggesting Trump was using the mechanism to transfer assets to his children without incurring a gift tax — something Trump’s father Fred was also accused of doing.

At a news conference shortly after the Times article was published online, Trump called the findings “totally fake news, made-up, fake,” but didn't dispute specific data cited by the report.

While Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is yet to comment on the revelations, his campaign is already seeking to take advantage with social media campaigns highlighting how much less Trump paid in taxes compared to teachers, nurses and firefighters.

Other Democrats were quick to attack Trump’s tax records, too particularly his willingness to pay more income tax to foreign governments than to the IRS.

“Befitting his pattern of selling out the American people throughout his presidency, today’s reporting paints a grim picture of Trump as a grifter who paid more in income taxes to foreign governments than to the United States,” Rep. Donald McEachin (D-VA) said in a statement.",Bombshell Report Shows How Much Trump Paid in Taxes to Foreign Governments

Fauci points out that post 911 and Pearl Harbor, ""we didn't have any political arguing about what we needed to do. Everybody was in it together. That's really what we're dealing with.""

Fauci wants people to remember that we shouldn't be fighting each other—as has been the case in America, especially with the ""highly charged political season with big-time, high-stakes elections.""

""We've lost sight of the fact that the bad guy here is the virus. The bad guy is not one side or the other,"" he said.

Wild Blueberries. ,https://www.eatthis.com/fruit-brain-boost/,"Over the years, scientific research has shown that while a balanced diet is key to staying healthy, there are certain foods that just knock it out of the park in terms of overall benefits for your body. But what about your mind? It turns out, there might be at least one easy option: According to a recent study, eating wild blueberries could be one of the easiest ways to give your brain an instant boost.

A recent randomized, double-blind, cross-over study examined 35 middle-aged individuals between 40 and 65 years old that were fed either one cup of wild blueberries or a placebo equivalent for breakfast. They were then asked to complete a series of cognitive tasks over the course of the day that tested brain function and memory. (Related: 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time.)

The results were clear: Those who had eaten wild blueberries (aka WBB) were able to maintain a sustained level of concentration and performance during the day in both sets of tasks, while those who had been given a placebo saw a decrease in performance as the day went on. Researchers also noticed that those in the wild blueberry group were faster in their correct responses than the placebo group.

""This study indicated acute cognitive benefits of [wild blueberry] WBB intake in cognitively healthy middle-aged individuals, particularly in the context of demanding tasks and cognitive fatigue,"" the study authors wrote.

This is far from the first study to find that wild blueberries provide bountiful brain benefits. A 2011 study published in The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry significantly improved the memory performance of older adults who were at risk for Alzheimer's disease. And a study from 2007 found that regularly consuming wild blueberries could help alleviate cognitive decline in aging adults—most likely thanks to their anti-inflammatory properties.

Whether you're putting them in your morning oatmeal or simply taking them down by the handful as you run out the door, it sounds like there's plenty of science behind blueberries as a fantastic and healthy snack.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

His eyes. ,https://lovindublin.com/news/this-is-the-first-thing-that-women-notice-always-about-men,"I know what you are probably all thinking, and it is not that, so stop it.

Men's Health magazine recently put the question ""What's the first thing you notice about a man?"" to 200 women, and the results were really interesting!

Nearly a majority of women said that the first thing they notice in a man on the street is his eyes. I am a woman, so I feel I have some authority on the matter, and I would agree with the eye thing!

For anyone really hoping to improve their chances with the opposite sex, they also included the top five things, after eyes, that women notice.

In order it goes, eyes, smile, height, hands and style.

After all that quizzing, the magazine also showed each woman a picture of a man in a Speedo and asked what caught their eye first. The main responses were abs, face and shoulders/biceps.

So if you want to get the girl of your dreams, just look her in the eye. Don't be too intense about it though ... that never ends well.

"583,000 turbines which would take up about the total land mass of Rhode Island. ",https://www.iflscience.com/technology/heres-how-much-the-us-would-need-to-be-covered-in-wind-turbines-to-power-the-nation/,"The US District Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, will hear arguments this Tuesday over the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which dictates carbon-cutting standards for states based on their greenhouse-gas emissions.

The Supreme Court put a hold on enforcement of the plan in February to allow legal challenges to it to be resolved in court. If the Court of Appeals rules that the government can legally enforcement the plan, the country will have to start using a lot more renewable energy (like wind and solar) — and much less coal — by the year 2030.

Part of the plan calls for the creation of incentives to encourage states to build wind farms. Though the US invested $14.5 billion in wind-power project installations last year, wind farms still provide less than 5% of the nation's energy, according to the American Wind Energy Association.

But what would a US powered only by wind actually look like?

To answer that question, AWEA's manager of industry data analysis, John Hensley, did the following math: 4.082 billion megawatt-hours (the average annual US electricity consumption) divided by 7,008 megawatt-hours of annual wind energy production per wind turbine equals approximately 583,000 onshore turbines.

In terms of land use, those 583,000 turbines would take up about the total land mass of Rhode Island, Hensley says, because wind projects typically require 0.74 acres of land per megawatt produced.

Jorge Luis Plata/REUTERS

To make his calculation, Hensley considered that the average wind turbine has an output of 2 megawatts of power and is 40% efficient. That means it can reach its full power-generating potential 40% of the time, since wind is not always blowing and farms sometimes shut down for routine maintenance. That percentage also accounts for constraints to the electrical grid — if an electrical grid receives more power from a wind farm than it can handle, for example, managers will turn off a few turbines.

Forty percent is actually pretty efficient, Hensley says. For comparison, solar projects operate at an average of 20% efficiency, and fossil-fuel production facilities operate at 40% to 60% of their full capacity on average.

When you multiply a wind turbine's average potential (2 megawatts) by its 40% annual energy efficiency, 365 days a year, you get Hensley's estimate of the megawatt-hours of energy production each turbine can produce (7,008).

Thanks to technological advancements in wind turbine technology, the cost of deploying wind energy has fallen by 90% since the 1980s.

Chris New

Wind turbines can also now be built taller and larger than ever, allowing them to harness more power than in years past, Hensley says. Offshore wind farms, in which turbines are installed in oceans rather than on land, can offer about 33% more power than onshore ones, since there is more wind blowing over the sea than on land.

Of course, installing more than half a million turbines across the US would be a moonshot project, even with the recent cost reductions. But investing in more renewable energy — so that we're less dependent on fossil fuels — is certainly a worthy goal.

Blanco tequila. ,https://www.ladbible.com/more/interesting-the-1-alcoholic-drink-to-choose-if-you-want-to-avoid-a-hangover-20160921,"Freshers, listen up - this one is for you - a drink that will prevent a hangover.

Hangovers are interesting son of a bitches that always tend to hit me where it hurts most. The delayed hangover strikes on Monday morning when you really don't need that little shit hanging from your head while you prepare your body into working mode again.

The only thing worse than a hangover are the imaginative hangover cures that never seem to work. So far, I've tried raw egg, downing milk (that wasn't a pretty sight), pure orange juice, clean breakfast, greasy breakfast. You name it, I've tried it.

Someone suggested downing three cans of full-fat coke once, but that's problematic because, you know, I don't wanna die when I'm 34.

Advert 10

So, in a change of tactics, what about if I could have just as much fun in the evening and NOT have to suffer the next day? Well, it's all in the drink, apparently.

Why is it that, besides getting shit-faced, each drink has a different, but equally as grim side effect? Gin, for example, is mother's ruin. If you start crying around me on a night out, the only thing that you'll hear me saying is, 'put the gin down'. Vodka on the other hand makes some of my friends aggressive. Interestingly, it's always the quiet ones who go bat-shit crazy on cheap vodka. Wine, enough about that said, the better. Who orders wine on a night out?

And, lager creates this:

All of which, especially combined, still result in hangovers.

Advert 10

So, stereotypes aside, wouldn't it be great for there to be a drink that is actually going to save your mother of all headaches in the morning.

Well, according to the Daily Star, a team of fitness professionals have concluded that tequila, blanco tequila to be specific, is in fact the best drink to choose if you don't react well to hangovers.

This is because the alcohol is made from 100 percent agave, a Mexican plan, and is void of sugar and corn syrup that adds solid flavour but is your worst enemy the day after the night before.

""As long as you stay hydrated and don't drink, like, a whole bottle, you're fine. Not hungover,"" says Jason Eisner, director at Hollywood's trendy vegan bar-restaurant Gracias Madre.

Singing without a mask on. ,https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/doing-this-innocent-activity-indoors-can-speed-up-the-spread-of-covid-19-dramatically,"A recent peer-reviewed study revealed one of the quickest and easiest ways to spread COVID-19: singing indoors, without a mask on.



The study, published in Indoor Air, confirmed what was already suspected after a choir rehearsal in early March became one of the first superspreading events in the US.



On March 10 in Skagit Valley, Washington, 61 people attended their regular 2.5-hour choir practice. One choir member admitted to showing flu-like symptoms prior to attending the rehearsal that evening. In the following weeks, 53 people who attended the rehearsal fell ill and tested positive for COVID-19. Of those, three people were hospitalized and two died.



Even though the attendees were careful not to touch each other and sanitize their hands, most of them still got sick. This was believed to be caused by the transmission and buildup of aerosols, which can increase through acts of talking loudly or singing, especially indoors. The recent study, led by professor of mechanical engineering Shelly Miller, verifies that.



“This study documents in great detail that the only plausible explanation for this superspreading event was transmission by aerosols,” Miller said. “Shared air is important because you can be inhaling what someone else exhaled even if they are far away from you.”



According to the researchers, there is not enough reason to believe that droplets and infected surfaces were responsible for transmitting the virus. For so many people to be infected in a short span of time, the virus must have been airborne somehow.



“The inhalation of infectious respiratory aerosol from ‘shared air’ was the leading mode of transmission,” study co-author Jose-Luis Jimenez said.



Additional research already speculated on the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission via aerosols. According to Miller, singing is known to produce high amounts of aerosols — more than whispering or talking at a normal volume.



“You have the air that’s coming out on your respiratory tube, your mouth, and your nose, and there’s some liquid that’s lining all of your respiratory system,” Jimenez explained. “And when the air is going very quickly, it can basically grab a little bit of that material and put it in a particle, and then you expel it out into the air. That’s what happens. So anything that makes the air go faster or more strongly or produce more air is putting out more respiratory particles. If you’re singing, you’re breathing in a lot of air, you’re breathing out very forcefully, and you’re also moving your vocal cords. The vocal cords are wet, they’re covered in this fluid, they’re vibrating, and that can also produce more particles.”



Not only this, but the likelihood of virus transmission only increases in an indoor setting, where the aerosol particles are trapped, making it almost impossible not to breathe in the virus.



Researchers noted that a 30-minute rehearsal, rather than a 2.5-hour one would have reduced the rate of infection from 87% to 12%.



For now, the study authors are recommending that choral directors move their rehearsals outdoors, if possible, as well as requiring all those attending to wear masks and stand 6 feets apart. However, the safest option would be to avoid singing in groups at all for a while, especially if getting outside isn’t an option for you.



“What we’re recommending right now is definitely staying six feet apart with masks, with good ventilation, in very short duration of 30 minutes, with breaks to air out the room,” Miller said.



The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supported this conclusion and originally issued a report stating that group singing events were considered high-risk and increased chances of transmission. However, that language was later removed from CDC guidelines, due to political concerns.



However, experts say that the virus still needs to be taken seriously, and the recent findings in this study support that.



“[Group singing remains] extremely dangerous and irresponsible,” Jimenez said. “The research adds to the overwhelming body of evidence that aerosol transmission is playing a major role in driving this pandemic and especially to superspreading events.”



Dr. James Hamblin offered The Atlantic this simple advice to be considerate of others:



“A general rule for minimizing the spread of any respiratory virus: Silence is safer than whispering. Whispering is safer than talking. Talking is safer than singing.”

Toxic blooms of cyanobacteria. ,https://abcnews.go.com/International/350-suddenly-collapsed-died-scientists-now-explanation/story?id=73162610,"The mystery surrounding hundreds of sudden elephant deaths in Botswana seems to have been solved and the findings bring an end to months of speculation on why at least 330 elephants were found dead in the northwestern region of the Southern African country earlier this year.

Initially, possible explanations over the deaths had ranged from poaching to anthrax to poisoning. Now, however, the country has pointed to toxic blooms of cyanobacteria, a naturally occurring neurotoxin and biological phenomenon which has increased due to climate change, according to Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer at the Botswana department of wildlife and national parks.

“As in so many other situations, such as the wildfires in California and Oregon and the floods in the U.K., climate change is the threat multiplier,” Dr Niall McCann, co-founder of U.K.-based charity National Park Rescue, told ABC News. “Climate change and the effect of global warming on the region is increasing both the intensity and severity of harmful algal blooms, making this issue more likely to reoccur.”

“Our latest tests have detected cyanobacterial neurotoxins to be the cause of deaths. These are anaerobe bacteria found in water of seasonal water pans” Mmadi Reuben told ABC News by phone from Gaborone, the country’s capital.

They spent months studying samples from the carcasses, environmental samples from soil and water as well as samples from the live animals and sent them to specialized regional laboratories as well as laboratories in the U.S., Canada and Europe, according to Reuben.

Most carcasses, spotted by aerial surveys, were found clustered around water sources close to the Okavango Delta which, in normal times, is a major tourist safari destination. Some animals were even seen walking dizzily in circles before suddenly dying.

“The unexplained deaths ceased as these seasonal waterholes and water pans dried up in late June, the beginning of our fall,” Reuben explained. “We have a number of hypotheses we are investigating.”

With the exception of one horse, other animal species were not affected by the blue-green algae phenomenon.

“One working hypothesis is that, unlike other animals, elephants suck water with their trunks from underneath, so they drink from deeper levels in the waterholes, closer to silt where the anaerobe toxins are contained,” Reuben explained.

Although there are no official indications that the Botswana elephant deaths might be linked to the unresolved deaths of more than 20 elephants near Hwange, a national park in neighboring Zimbabwe, in August, McCann believes a common denominator is climate change.

“Climate change is the ultimate cause, even if the proximate cause is something different,” claims McCann. “These type of things are only going to become more common, more frequent and the issue of warming waterholes is going to become worse and worse in time.”

Because of climate change, Southern Africa’s temperatures are rising at twice the global average, according to CSAG, one of the leading climate research groups in Africa.

Botswana is home to about 130.000 elephants -- the world's largest elephant population -- with more than a third of Africa's elephants, according to the latest Great Elephant Census, which Reuben's colleagues at the Department for Wildlife and Natural Parks helped produce. It is also one of the most stable countries in Africa with one of the best wildlife records. Tourism accounts for a fifth of Botswana's GDP.

“The important thing is that investigations continue into why this happened so that going forward we can stop this from happening again in time,” concluded Reuben. “The country is already engaged in development of monitoring plan aimed at detecting the blooms early in the water before they cause harm to the animals and taking necessary precautions,”",Over 330 elephants suddenly collapsed and died.

On Why the Virus is So Brutal

""Unimagined just a few short months ago, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has upended our entire planet, quickly challenging past assumptions and future certainties. It possesses simultaneously three characteristics that have allowed it to render an historic assault on the human species, triggering a virtual global 'lockdown' as the only weapon against uncontrolled spread. It combines the characteristics of being a virus that to our knowledge has never before infected humans in a sustained manner, together with its extraordinary efficiency in transmitting from person to person and its relatively high level of morbidity and mortality, especially among seniors and those with underlying co-morbidities. It indeed is the perfect storm of an emerging infectious disease.""

On Why We Must Take Control of the Virus

""First, in the immediate sense, it is important to mitigate spread of infection, illness, and death. Second, it is critical to prevent the persistence of microbes that may lead to additional emergences that are cumulatively as deadly, or more so, than the original emergences. That viral genetic descendants of the 1918 influenza pandemic virus are still causing seasonal outbreaks throughout the world, and still killing cumulatively millions of people a century later, is a powerful reminder that single disease emergences can have consequences beyond immediate morbidity and mortality. In the ancient ongoing struggle between microbes and man, genetically more adaptable microbes have the upper hand in consistently surprising us and often catching us unprepared.""

At some time in the future we will be better able to compare and contrast COVID-19 to other important emerging diseases; however, at this time we are still just entering a steep learning curve that will surely keep surprising us as we struggle to control what is already among the deadliest pandemics of the past century.""

With regard to the latter, although SARS-CoV-2 infects cells of the gastrointestinal tract, fecal transmission has not to date been implicated in significant person-to-person viral spread.""

On How to Limit Future Pandemics

""Living in greater harmony with nature will require changes in human behavior as well as other radical changes that may take decades to achieve: rebuilding the infrastructures of human existence, from cities to homes to workplaces, to water and sewer systems, to recreational and gatherings venues. In such a transformation we will need to prioritize changes in those human behaviors that constitute risks for the emergence of infectious diseases. Chief among them are reducing crowding at home, work, and in public places as well as minimizing environmental perturbations such as deforestation, intense urbanization, and intensive animal farming. Equally important are ending global poverty, improving sanitation and hygiene, and reducing unsafe exposure to animals, so that humans and potential human pathogens have limited opportunities for contact.""

It should force us to begin to think in earnest and collectively about living in more thoughtful and creative harmony with nature, even as we plan for nature's inevitable, and always unexpected, surprises.""

Given that we use them to dry parts of our body that we've just given a good wash, you could be forgiven for thinking that you can get away with a once weekly wash - or perhaps even less, for some.

So how often should I wash my towels?

It seems that we should actually be washing our towels much more regularly than that, according to the experts.

Philip Tierno, a microbiologist at New York University School of Medicine, revealed that a towel - even if it's properly dried - shouldn't be used more than three times.

He explained to Tech Radar, “If you can dry it completely, no more than three times max. A damp towel is growing.

""Wherever there is odour, there are microbes growing so it should be washed.”

Towels should be cleaned regularly to avoid drying yourself off with a towel that's full of growing bacteria - yuck.

Dr. Gerba, a microbiologist, also told Time US, “After about two days, if you dry your face on a hand towel, you’re probably getting more E. coli on your face than if you stuck your head in a toilet and flushed it.” Pretty gross, right?

And it seems they're alone in her estimations.

Cleaning expert with Fantastic Service Ralitsa Prodanova, agrees that we should be washing our towels after every three or four uses - which, for people who shower daily, is every three or four days.

She told metro.co.uk, ""If you get a musty smell when you bring the towel up to your nose, that’s bacteria growing on the towel itself. And because towels are often warm and damp, they’re the perfect breeding ground for bugs and germs.""

So is this what most people are doing?

According to a 2018 GE Appliances poll, taking in results of over 1,500 people, 50% said they'd actually use a towel five times before washing it.

But, a further 14% of respondents said they'd use a towel eight times or more before they washed it.

It lures people into the store. ,https://www.mashed.com/150302/this-is-why-costcos-hot-dog-combos-really-cost-1-50/,"This Is Why Costco's Hot Dog Combos Really Cost $1.50

Legions of Costco fans pony up their annual membership fee each year to take advantage of the bulk retailer's incredible deals on everything from 128-ounce jars of Hellmann's mayonnaise, to deeply discounted magnum bottles of surprisingly drinkable house brand champagne. But the true Costco fanatics know that a big part of the wholesale club giant's success comes a quarter pound at a time, and is served at the Costco food court: The legendary hot dog and 20 ounce soda combo, which clocks in at a wallet-pleasing $1.50.

It's one of the best bargains in quick-service food, but how did this ridiculously good deal get its start? It all began in 1984, when Hebrew National set up a cart outside of a Costco location in San Diego, in an attempt to lure in hungry customers, exhausted from hoisting 50-pound bags of dog food into their Costco shopping carts. The combo was an immediate success, and the price has remained unchanged for over 30 years, since 1985.

What drives ordinarily profit-hungry executives to keep the price for the hot dog and soda combo so impossibly low? After all, Costco actually loses money on every single combo sold, which adds up to around 135 million hot dogs per year. Tweaking prices, even a little, could dramatically impact the company's bottom line.

According 425Business, when Costco CEO W. Craig Jelenik complained about keeping a loss-leader like the hot dog combo on the menu to Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal, Sinegal made his opinion on the matter abundantly clear.

""I came to (Jim Sinegal) once and I said, 'Jim, we can't sell this hot dog for a buck fifty. We are losing our rear ends,'"" Jelenik explained. ""And he said, 'If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.' That's all I really needed. By the way, if you raised (the price) to $1.75, it would not be that big of a deal. People would still buy (it). But it's the mindset that when you think of Costco, you think of the $1.50 hot dog (and soda).""

Why such an impassioned commitment to hot dog pricing? There are a few reasons. First, Costco is making a strategic choice to lose a few pennies on every hot dog combo sold, because it draws people into the store where they may be tempted to drop $1,400 on an outdoor patio set, or $2,500 on a riding lawn mower. A single customer who comes for the hot dogs but stays for the big screen television wipes out the loss on a few thousand hot dogs in just one transaction.

But there's another reason to keep prices low, and the food court humming with activity: A warm, family-friendly atmosphere creates excitement, and all of that action in the food court can be enough to lure in even more additional shoppers, as well as inspire existing customers to keep renewing their annual memberships.

Keeping the hot dog and soda combo at such a ridiculously low price hasn't always been easy, and has required some changes to product sourcing along the way. In 2013, Costco switched from serving Coca Cola products to Pepsi products, partly in an effort to keep costs low and maintain the hot dog combo's $1.50 price point. But there was an even more dramatic change even earlier, in 2009, when the company stopped serving Hebrew National brand all-beef kosher hot dogs, and instead established their own manufacturing facilities to produce the hot dogs in-house.

""What we figured out we could do is build our own hot dog-manufacturing plant (in Los Angeles) and make our own Kirkland Signature hot dogs,"" explained Jelenik. ""Now we are doing so much hot dog business that we've opened up another plant in Chicago.

Though the change sent shock waves rippling through Costco food courts nationwide, the change not only helped keep the price at $1.50, but ultimately may have resulted in an even better product. According to Costco, the house-manufactured Kirkland brand hot dogs now served at every food court are ""10 percent heavier and longer than the old,"" and they're a better quality hot dog.

""By having the discipline to say, 'You are not going to be able to raise your price. You have to figure it out,' we took it over and started manufacturing our hot dogs. We keep it at $1.50 and make enough money to get a fair return.""

In the 2009 edition of Costco Connection, David Fuller, the assistant vice president of publishing, clarified the rationale for keeping the combo priced at $1.50 even further. He says that Costco was committed to showing that ""a business can operate on a fair markup and still pay all of its bills.""

""Holding a price that steady for that long sends a clear message about what is possible when you decide to operate your business model on a 'cost plus' basis instead of a 'what the market will bear' basis,"" Fuller wrote.

In spite of technically losing money on every hot dog sold, the $1.50 combo is probably here to stay. It keeps customers coming back again and again, and indirectly translates to big business for the retail giant. We think journalist Eric Schaefer summed up the deal best, in his article for the Phoenix Sun Times: ""What's more American than buying 24 rolls of toilet paper, 64 ounces of mayonnaise, a case of beer, a few racks of ribs from the butcher, and throwing down a hot dog on the way out? Simply put: nothing. And as a bonus, you can also buy enough antacid to last a lifetime.""",This Is Why Costco's Hot Dog Combos Really Cost $1.50

But when they thought back to their favorite items from their own registry, the one they couldn’t get out of their heads was one they hadn’t asked for — and actually hadn’t opened yet.

We'd say, 'We think this is a mountain, but maybe it's a molehill. Maybe we don't need it yet,'"" said Gunn. Courtesy of Kathy Gunn

Kathy Gunn’s great-aunt Alison, a “surrogate grandmother” figure to whom Gunn is quite close, had presented them with a mysterious box marked “Do not open until first disagreement.”

RELATED: How to find lifetime love: 10 secrets from couples married for decades

Since Alison and her husband, Bill, had been married nearly half a century until he passed away in 2004, the Gunns assumed the box held some sort of profound secret — perhaps a heartfelt letter about struggles the older couple had faced and how they had overcome. “We didn’t want to ruin the importance of taking that in by opening it after a silly fight,” Kathy Gunn told TODAY.

""The box became a running joke with our family,"" said Gunn. ""My mom became concerned a year or two ago that there could be food inside ... I had to call Aunt Alison to confirm there wasn’t anything perishable!"" Courtesy of Kathy Gunn

Nine years into their marriage, the Gunns had long passed their first disagreement — but the box remained wrapped in the closet.

“When you first get married, there are growing pains: learning how to live with someone else, finding out their crazy quirks,” Gunn explained. “The issues change depending on how long you’ve been married and what’s gong on in your life … first you fight about about picking up clothes off the floor, then later you fight about not getting sleep because of colicky babies.”

She continued, “Problems evolve over time. When we would think about the box, we would keep that in mind. We’d say, ‘We think this is a mountain, but maybe it’s a molehill. Maybe we don’t need it yet.’”

Fast forward to that May 2016 brainstorming session. “We were talking about the gifts we had cherished … I looked at my husband and said, ‘We still have that box,’” recalled Gunn. “He said, ‘If we’ve made it this far, I don’t think we need the box to save us.’”

They decided to open it ... and burst out laughing when they saw what was inside.

Wine glasses, candles, and money for flowers and pizza. (Time-tested tricks, to be sure.)

""We thought there would be a long, heartfelt letter about the struggles (Alison and her husband, Bill) had faced,"" said Gunn. Courtesy of Kathy Gunn

But over those nine years, the box had come to mean much more: Its very existence helped the Gunns keep their perspective and work through issues that could have otherwise broken them. ""It really forced us, every time we had a disagreement, to think about the bigger picture and ask, 'Is it really that big of a deal?'"" said Gunn.

Related: Bride and groom ask guests to commit random acts of kindness as wedding gifts

She felt compelled to write about the box and published a personal essay to the Love What Matters Facebook page. ""It was kind of a way to thank aunt Alison for helping us out the last nine years,"" she explained

It turns out the great-aunt wasn't the only one touched by Gunn's words. The essay went viral, and Alison actually heard about it through friends before Gunn got a chance to send it. ""She was flabbergasted!"" said Gunn. ""And tickled. She thinks that it’s the funniest and the cutest thing, because she can’t believe we even hung onto it for that long.""

""We did act on her advice!"" said Gunn. ""We took a little vacation to Nashville for our 9th anniversary."" Courtesy of Kathy Gunn

Gunn is thrilled her message has hit its mark. ""I hope it will inspire people to reassess their situations and think about their love — why they got married in the first place,"" she said.

Pizza. ,https://nypost.com/2017/09/01/this-is-what-an-astronaut-craves-after-9-months-in-space/,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — After 9 ½ months in orbit, what’s on Peggy Whitson’s wish list? Will the record-setting NASA astronaut miss anything about space life?

Whitson was scheduled to answer reporters’ question during her final news conference from space this week, days before her scheduled return to Earth. But it was called off because of Harvey: Houston is home to Johnson Space Center and Mission Control for the International Space Station.

Instead, NASA relayed questions from The Associated Press to Whitson by email.

The questions and answers have been edited and condensed.

Q: What are your thoughts as you get ready to close out your mission? Has the flight hurried by or seemed to have dragged?

A: Actually, most of the flight has gone by very quickly. In fact, I would say that it didn’t feel any longer than my previous two flights of 6 months in duration. I would say the slowest time has been the last week or so. I think it has to do with switching in your mind where you want/need to be. Once the switch is thrown to go home, time seems to move a lot slower.

Q: You will be arriving back to a storm-crippled Houston. How has the catastrophe there affected your mindset? How did you and your husband’s home fare?

A: Our home is fine, but so many friends and co-workers have been impacted. For example, in order to keep Mission Control running, the team (three shifts of a skeleton support crew) were sleeping on cots in the backup Mission Control rooms. Their sacrifices for the station and keeping things running up here are amazing. Any trepidations I might have about returning in the aftermath of a hurricane are entirely eclipsed by the all those folks keeping our mission going and physically putting themselves out there to help folks who were less fortunate than us.

Q: Besides family and friends, what have you missed most about Earth?

A: Flush toilets. Trust me, you don’t want to know the details. Pizza has been on my mind for a month or two, since (U.S. astronaut) Jack (Fischer) told the ground we weren’t a pizza delivery place when he was joking with them.

Q: What will you miss most about space?

A: Things I will miss: I know that I will hugely miss the freedom of floating and moving with the lightest of touch, especially those first few days after my return when gravity will especially SUCK. I will miss seeing the enchantingly peaceful limb of our Earth from this vantage point. Until the end of my days, my eyes will search the horizon to see that curve.

I will miss seeing and working within this awe-inspiring creation that we, as a people, have constructed here in space, travelling at 17,500 mph. I still can’t believe the incredible level of detail that was required to imagine this place, let alone to build it! I will also miss the ability to “go for a walk” in a spaceship built for one.

And mostly, I will miss that incredible sense of satisfaction, gratitude and pride that comes from working with the NASA team from on orbit.

Q: You broke quite a few records on this mission. What are your thoughts about being a space superwoman?

A: I have noted in more than a few interviews that I am not overly comfortable with the praise about the records. I honestly do think that it is critical that we are continuously breaking records, because that represents us moving forward in exploration. I am working on paying forward some of the advice and mentoring that I received on my journey, in hopes that one day those young people will do the same, and look back on a life in which they leapt at the opportunities and broke their own records.

Q: How much longer could you envision yourself staying up there, if you had to? An entire year? Longer?

A: Yes, I do think I could have flown in space longer. The resistive exercise device is much better than the previous versions, and does a fantastic job of keeping us fit from a bone and muscle perspective.

Q: Is this your last spaceflight, in all likelihood? What’s next for you?

A: I am not sure what the future holds for me personally, but I envision myself continuing to work on spaceflight programs. My desire to contribute to the spaceflight team as we move forward in our exploration of space has only increased over the years.",This is what an astronaut craves after 9 months in space
He called friends whom he still had disagreements with and put an end to any lingering conflicts. ,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/shaquille-oneal-kobe-bryant-life-change_n_5e30434fc5b6d34ea10561c5,"Shaquille O’Neal said that he made a major life change in the wake of Kobe Bryant’s unexpected death in a helicopter crash.

After learning about Bryant’s death, O’Neal said he called friends whom he still had disagreements with to put an end to any lingering conflicts.

“Look, I’m all about being hard and all that, but after yesterday, I’m going to have to delete my beef and my confrontation clause,” O’Neal said during an episode of his podcast, “The Big Podcast with Shaq,” recorded. “I don’t want to do that anymore because, you know, you never know.”

Bryant and O’Neal famously had a long-standing feud while playing together on the Los Angeles Lakers during the late ’90s and early ’00s that they eventually put aside on an episode of O’Neal’s podcast in 2015.

The two had a loving but contentious and competitive relationship, trading barbs (before quickly making up) as recently as August 2019.

“So yesterday I just called all the people I had discrepancies with and just said, ‘Look man, I love you.’ And we didn’t talk much after the phone, but I just — I just wish we did,” he added, not naming who he spoke with. “You know, we’re sort of like similar guys, hey, family first, business, and I’ll see you when I see you. I have a lot of best friends, but I don’t do the mushy talking on the phone thing.”

O’Neal said in addition to those he called to settle conflicts with, he also called his best friend and made a promise to check in on his other friends more.

Speaking with palpable pain in his voice, the basketball great added that he’s “not sleeping, not eating, not really functioning,” as he just lost his sister Ayesha Harrison-Jex to cancer in October 2019, and he’s now hurting over the loss of his “brother,” Bryant.

When O’Neal reflected on what he would’ve done differently with Bryant, he said, “I wish I would’ve communicated more. But again, that’s just how we are.”

“When we saw each other it was love and respect and he looked out for the kids and I kept an eye on his daughter Gigi ― she was a fabulous player,” he said. “I just wish I could’ve talked to him like before. That’s it. Everything that happened, happened.”

On the podcast, O’Neal said he refused to believe the news of Bryant’s death was real, initially thinking that it was a hoax. He was working out with his sons, Shaqir and Greg, when Greg showed him a clip from TMZ.

“I figured someone was just playing around. I didn’t want to believe it. And everyone’s calling me, ‘Is it true? Is it true?’ So, I’m like, it must not be a hoax because now the whole world knows this information. So now I’m saying, ‘Please don’t be true. Please don’t be true. Please don’t be true,’” O’Neal said.

“And I’m watching. And then you get the confirmation. And sad enough, then you hear his daughter was with him. I didn’t do anything,” he added. “I haven’t eaten. I haven’t slept. I’m looking at all the tapes. But, I’m sick right now. ”

Apparently, this now includes wearing plastic water jugs on your head. Yup, you read that right.

In pictures posted on Facebook on Jan. 28 by Lynn Carter, a woman can be seen at Vancouver International Airport wearing what appears to be a plastic water bottle on her head while also donning a surgical mask over her mouth.

The lid of the bottle is missing in order to let the person breathe. A hole was also cut into the back of the bottle to feed her ponytail through.

According to online publication Vancouver Is Awesome, a third photo was also posted by Carter depicting another woman with a child, both wearing bottles on their heads, while riding a train.

There has been one confirmed case of the coronavirus in B.C. after a man in his 40s arrived home to Vancouver last week after travelling to Wuhan.

There are two confirmed cases of the virus in Ontario after a man and his wife – both in their 50s – were the first Canadians diagnosed with the novel virus.

There are more currently more than 5,900 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in China, of which 132 have died.

Chips and salsa. ,https://nypost.com/2020/01/28/this-is-what-astronaut-christina-koch-craved-after-record-11-months-in-orbit/,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — After nearly 11 months in orbit, the astronaut holding the record for the longest spaceflight by a woman can’t wait to dig into some salsa and chips, and swim and surf in the Gulf of Mexico.

NASA astronaut Christina Koch told The Associated Press on Tuesday — her 319th consecutive day in space — that taking part in the first all-female spacewalk was the highlight of her mission. She’s been living on the International Space Station since March and returns to Earth on Feb. 6, landing in Kazakhstan with two colleagues aboard a Russian capsule.

Koch said she and fellow astronaut Jessica Meir appreciated that the Oct. 18 spacewalk “could serve as an inspiration for future space explorers.”

“We both drew a lot of inspiration from seeing people that were reflections of ourselves as we were growing up and developing our dreams to become astronauts,” Koch told The Associated Press from the space station.

“So to recognize that maybe we could pay that forward and serve the same for those that are up and coming was just such a highlight.”

Koch’s astronaut class of 2013 was split equally between women and men, but NASA’s astronaut corps as a whole is male-dominated. Right now, four men and two women are living at the space station.

“Diversity is important and I think it is something worth fighting for,” said Koch, an electrical engineer who also has a physics degree.

Koch’s 328-day mission will be the second-longest by an American, trailing Scott Kelly’s flight by 12 days. She’s already set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman.

She took time out for a pair of news interviews Tuesday, the 34th anniversary of the space shuttle Challenger accident that claimed all seven lives on board.

She said she loves her work — she conducted five spacewalks and tended to science experiments — but she also misses her friends and family.

“If they could visit here, I would continue staying for a very long time,” Koch, a first-time space flier, told the AP. “For their sake, I think that it’s probably time to head home.”

Her biggest surprise is how easily and quickly she adapted both mentally and physically to weightlessness.

“I don’t even really realize that I’m floating anymore,” she said.

Why do chips and salsa top her most-missed food list? Crunchy food like chips are banned on the space station because the crumbs could float away and clog equipment. “I haven’t had chips in about 10 1/2 months,” she explained, “but I have had a fresh apple” thanks to regular cargo deliveries.

Another thing she misses: the ability to put things down and not have them float away.

She’s gotten used to using Velcro and tape to make things stay put, “so I hope that when I go back to Earth, I don’t accidentally drop things, especially when I’m handing them to people.”

Kelly, whose mission spanned 2015 and 2016, has given her advance notice of what to expect.

“It’s a great reminder to keep mentoring,” Koch said. When her record is broken, “I hope to mentor that person just as I’ve been mentored.”

Koch said it was crucial staying connected to loved ones through phone calls and video conferences. She watched as her nieces and nephews opened their Christmas presents. But it’s also special celebrating holidays in space, she noted, which “kind of takes any sting off of missing your family.”

Koch grew up in Jacksonville, North Carolina and now lives near the Gulf of Mexico in Galveston, Texas with her husband, Bob. She said she can’t wait for their next wedding anniversary, Christmas at home and his birthday.

Her 41st birthday is Wednesday. How does she plan to celebrate?

Lyme disease. ,https://www.medpagetoday.com/popmedicine/celebritydiagnosis/84393,"Last year, many observers had speculated that pop singer Justin Bieber, 25, was battling severe depression. This week Bieber responded on Instagram to a TMZ report that he was, instead, recuperating from Lyme disease.

""While a lot of people kept saying Justin Bieber looks like sh**t, on meth etc. they failed to realize I've been recently diagnosed with Lyme disease, not only that but had a serious case of chronic mono which affected my skin, brain function, energy, and overall health. These things will be explained further in a docuseries I'm putting on YouTube shortly. you can learn all that I've been battling and OVERCOMING!! It's been a rough couple years but getting the right treatment that will help treat this so far incurable disease and I will be back and better than ever""

The 10-part docuseries, Justin Bieber: Seasons, which will air in late January, reportedly shows Bieber and his family discussing the multiple symptoms the Canadian singer had been experiencing during 2019. Before finally being diagnosed late in the year, he received a variety of treatments which only made the symptoms worse.

Bieber's wife of four months, Hailey Baldwin Bieber, supported him in a tweet: ""For those who are trying to downplay the severity of Lyme disease. Please do your research and listen to the stories of people who have suffered with it for years. Making fun of and belittling a disease you don't understand is never the way, all it takes is educating yourself.""

What is Lyme Disease?

Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and rarely, Borrelia mayonii. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. The blacklegged tick (or deer tick, Ixodes scapularis) spreads the disease in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central U.S. The western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) spreads the disease on the Pacific Coast.

Lyme Disease causes more than 300,00 illnesses each year in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the number of cases of Lyme disease reported to the CDC has increased steadily over the past 25 years. In addition, the disease appears to be expanding geographically: The number of counties with an incidence of ≥10 confirmed cases per 100,000 persons increased from 324 in 2008 to 415 in 2018.

What are the Symptoms of Lyme Disease?

The symptoms of Lyme disease can be divided into four stages:

1. Early localized stage (3-30 days post-tick bite)

Bulls-eye rash illustration

Red, expanding rash called erythema migrans (EM)

Fatigue, chills, fever, headache, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes

Not all people get the erythema migrans rash. General symptoms may be the only evidence of infection. Some people get a small bump or redness at the site of a tick bite that goes away in 1-2 days, like a mosquito bite.

More about Erythema Migrans:

Rash occurs in approximately 70-80% of infected persons and begins at the site of a tick bite after a delay of 3-30 days (average is about 7 days)

Rash gradually expands over a period of several days and can reach up to 12 inches (30 cm) across. Parts of the rash may clear as it enlarges, resulting in a ""bull's-eye"" appearance

Rash usually feels warm to the touch but is rarely itchy or painful

EM lesions may appear on any area of the body

2. Early disseminated stage (days to weeks post-tick bite)

Bell's palsy

Untreated, the infection may spread from the site of the bite to other parts of the body, producing an array of specific symptoms that may come and go, including:

Facial or Bell's palsy (muscle weakness on one or both sides of the face

Severe headaches and neck stiffness due to meningitis (inflammation of the spinal cord)

Pain and swelling in the large joints (such as knees)

Shooting pains that may interfere with sleep

Heart palpitations and dizziness due to changes in heartbeat

Many of these symptoms will resolve over a period of weeks to months, even without treatment. However, lack of treatment can result in additional complications, described below.

3. Late disseminated stage (months-to-years post-tick bite)

Approximately 60% of patients with untreated infection may begin to have intermittent bouts of arthritis, with severe joint pain and swelling. Large joints are most often affected, particularly the knees.

Up to 5% of untreated patients may develop chronic neurological complaints months to years after infection. These include shooting pains, numbness or tingling in the hands or feet, and problems with short-term memory.

4. Lingering symptoms after treatment (post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome)

Approximately 10-20% of patients with Lyme disease have symptoms that last months to years after treatment with antibiotics. These symptoms can include muscle and joint pains, cognitive defects, sleep disturbance, or fatigue. The cause of these symptoms is not known, but there is no evidence that these symptoms are due to ongoing infection with B. burgdorferi. This condition is referred to as Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). There is some evidence that PTLDS is caused by an autoimmune response, in which a person's immune system continues to respond, doing damage to the body's tissues, even after the infection has been cleared. Studies have shown that continuing antibiotic therapy is not helpful and can be harmful for persons with PTLDS.

How is Lyme Disease Diagnosed?

Lyme disease can be difficult to diagnose for several reasons. Many of the common symptoms associated with the disease, such as headaches, dizziness, and joint/body pain, also occur with other diseases. The most distinct symptom of Lyme disease, erythema migrans (EM), does not appear in at least one quarter of people who are infected with Lyme bacteria. Also, current diagnostic tests do not always detect early Lyme disease since antibodies take time to rise to detectable levels. In addition, antibodies normally persist in the blood for months or even years after the infection is gone; therefore, the test cannot be used to determine cure. Lastly, infection with other diseases, including some tickborne diseases, or some viral, bacterial, or autoimmune diseases, can result in false positive test results.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends a two-tiered testing approach: a conventional enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test, followed by a Western Blot test. The ELISA is a blood test that detects antibodies but does not test for B. burgdorferi itself. A positive result from this first-level screening may suggest current or past infection. The ELISA is designed to be very ""sensitive,"" meaning that almost everyone who has Lyme disease (and some people who do not) will test positive. If the screening test is negative, it is highly unlikely that the person has Lyme disease and no further testing is recommended. If the screening test is positive or inconclusive, a Western blot test should be performed to confirm the results.

Because treatment is generally more effective in early stages of the disease, it is important to develop new tools that can help doctors make an early diagnosis. On July 29, 2019, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared several Lyme disease serologic assays with new indications for use, allowing for an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) rather than western immunoblot assay as the second test in a Lyme disease testing algorithm.

How is Lyme Disease Treated?

According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, for early Lyme disease, a short course of oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline or amoxicillin, cures the majority of cases. In more complicated cases, Lyme disease can usually be successfully treated with three to four weeks of antibiotic therapy.

After being treated for Lyme disease, a minority of patients may still report non-specific symptoms, including persistent pain, joint and muscle aches, fatigue, impaired cognitive function, or unexplained numbness. These patients often show no evidence of active infection and may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS).

"Not a pregnancy, it's a 60-pound ovarian cyst. ",https://www.housediver.com/worldwide/weird-preg,"Meet Katie Smith, your average mid-twenty-year-old girl. Well, if you consider this situation average. When Ms. Smith was just 24 years old something starting unbelievable began growing inside of her and doctors couldn’t figure out what it was.

The Beginning

Katie’s stomach expanded so large and so fast that she seemed pregnant! The weird part, she wasn’t pregnant at all. Every pregnancy test that she took said negative but her doctors continued to dismiss her overwhelming concerns.



Her Story

Smith is 28 years old and from Swansea in Wales. Back in 2014, she began gaining weight, and within just a few years she resembled someone nine months pregnant. She told BBC that she never was super skinny, but gradually she developed a belly like this

Healthy Lifestyle

Katie lived a healthy life and was very conscious of keeping her figure. She loved her curves and spent a lot of time at the gym. This is why her progressive weight gain was so infuriating. Unfortunately, the mystery was left unsolved.

Not As It Seems

At this time Katie thought her biggest problem was whether she would be able to go to work Christmas party because she felt insecure in her outfit. At this time, Katie felt she was not thin enough.



Too Fast To Keep Up With

Katie tried everything but her stomach wouldn’t stop growing. As she said ” “I was exercising and eating healthily but I was slowly getting bigger. There’s nothing worse than keeping a healthy lifestyle but still gaining an excessive amount of weight.

What Was Going On?

It crept up so slowly [that] I didn’t know anything was wrong – I thought I was putting on timber.” Regardless of how much she worked out or maintained a strict diet, she was still gaining an enormous amount of weight.



Not Just Growing

At this point, she couldn’t ignore her excessive weight gain. She began to notice that all the weight she was gaining was going directly to her stomach, and it felt different too. How would she proceed?

Staying Hopeful

Her stomach started to feel hard and uncomfortable to touch. However, she stayed positive and was hopeful that this would go away with time…. but some things don’t always work out the way we want.



There’s Only One Explanation

Her dress size was increasing at rapid speed and she was now a size eight. But still, she was too afraid to see a doctor. She grew up with her father as a doctor and this made her a bit apprehensive.

Her Gut Feeling

Little did she know that bigger concerns were approaching. At this point, Katie could only think of one explanation. She wasn’t sure she wanted to believe it, however. What was she thinking it was?



With Child

When considering all the components Katie decided there was only one possible reasoning for this, and that was pregnancy. Her belly was growing and she was gaining weight, she was always exhausted, and had a serious boyfriend.

Unplanned Pregnancy

When looking at all the factors, all things pointed to a bun in the oven! This possibility made Katie and her boyfriend nervous. If she was pregnant, then it was surely unplanned. However, given her situation, this was a possibility.



Soon To Be Parents

Katie and her boyfriend Jamie Gibbons had been together for 10 years already and they did consider the possibility that she was pregnant. Although they weren’t ready for it, they knew they had to at least check.



The Blue Stripe

When the couple saw that the pregnancy test was negative, they were both surprised. They figured the test was incorrect, so she immediately took a second one. But it only showed the same result once again!

Getting Really Worried

They were surprised and decided it was time to see a doctor. What exactly was going on here? Was she sick? Did she have a miscarriage? A million dreaded things were popping into her head and really scaring her.



Facing Her Fears

Katie had no options left and it was time to finally see a doctor. Unfortunately, she did not receive the answer she was expecting or hoping for. The doctor simply told her that she was “merely fat.” At this point, she saw no way out.

Following Her Instincts

Although the doctors dismissed her worries, Katie felt something was wrong. She ignored it though because it didn’t impact her daily routine. Still, she couldn’t understand what was going on.

Not Trustworthy

She couldn’t stop wondering why she wasn’t pregnant. It seemed she was pregnant, so what was the deal? She didn’t fully trust the doctors and their thoughts. But, they were professionals so she should trust them, right?



No Solution

If she were pregnant, at least the problem would disappear once she gave birth. Unfortunately, her stomach continued growing for a full two years. Every month it just kept getting larger and larger until something awful happened at work.

She Didn’t Feel Well

It was just a normal day on the job when all of a sudden Katie felt light-headed and nauseous. That’s when she collapsed. She was told by her coworkers that she had fainted.



A Difficult Period

After this, Katie realized she needed to see a doctor right away. She said “It was a tough period in work and when I passed out my GP put it down to stress.” She had no other explanation and just had to continue her life like she was living it before.

All From Stress?

Is it possible to pass out simply from being too stressed out? Katie wasn’t too convinced. But her doctor tried to reassure her that nothing major was going on, and that she definitely wasn’t pregnant.



Not What It Appears

It was impossible to avoid unwanted questions regarding her “pregnancy.” People noticed her growing belly and there was no trying to ignore it. She had to explain herself repeatedly.

No End In Sight

Katie always answered with the same response day in and day out, ” The doctors say I am just overweight.” Although she was annoyed with the situation, she also saw no end approaching.



Due Date

She said people were always asking her when the baby was due, and after a while, she began to lie to spare them the embarrassment. So instead she just told them she is overweight, because this is what she believed.



Changing Appearance

Katie was waddling around with a giant belly and she started to feel embarrassed about her appearance. She even started to shop in the maternity section because nothing fit her.

Maternity Clothes

“I remember trying to shop for clothes in December 2016 and nothing would fit. I was skin and bone on top, then this massive lump and normal legs. The only thing that was going to fit was maternity wear.”



Needs Help

Katie was stubborn about getting help. Only after several blackouts at work, difficulties breathing, and excessive weight gain that interfered with her life, did she seek assistance.



Seeking Assistance

And this still wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for her coworkers who insisted she get checked out. Many people wonder why Katie didn’t take care of herself more. Something was clearly off, so why was it taking her so long to seek help?



A New Explanation

Katie was going about her life trying to avoid her situation. But enough was enough when she passed out four times! This time the doctor reasoned her exhaustion by blaming her acne medication but she refused to accept this response.

Time To Stand Up

It seemed like the doctors weren’t taking her symptoms or situation seriously. They continued to blame other causes and things going on in Katie’s life. She decided it was finally time to put her foot down.

Enough Was Enough

She had stopped taking it for several months before and insisted there had to be another explanation. She consulted a second doctor who also said she had to be pregnant. He did numerous blood tests that all came back with no results.

Getting To The Bottom Of It

Her GP concluded that the only explanation was pregnancy, regardless of the blood test results and no further examination. So, he ordered a second ultrasound. At this point even walking was a difficult task for Katie and she was having difficulty breathing.

The Truth At Last

The doctor who saw her requested that they immediately check if she was pregnant. Was she finally going to get to the bottom of this? Well, it certainly opened an entirely new can of worms that she was not expecting.

Terrified

Katie watched the doctor as she did the ultrasound. When she saw her expression it was clear something was wrong. Her eyes were enlarged and she had a look of fear come over her.

Consoling Katie

The doctor requested a consultant and Katie became paralyzed. Her boyfriend Jamie tried to console her but there was no stopping the panic she felt at that moment. What was really going on inside of her stomach?



Not Pregnant

The ultrasound screen was blank, and it was clear that Katie was not pregnant. However, there was something still going on inside her stomach. All they knew for sure was that her life was in danger.

Surprising News

The possibilities were endless, regardless they needed a CT to find out. Katie was understandably scared and extremely worried for what was to come. Her mind went to a number of possibilities.



Emergency CT

The blank ultrasound led to an immediate request for a CT scan that revealed astonishing news. The doctors prepared Katie for what they were about to tell her. Katie and her boyfriend sat hand in hand waiting for the big news.

Definitely Not Pregnant

Katie definitely wasn’t pregnant. The reason for her large belly was actually the result of a huge ovarian mass. At this point, Katie’s whole world came crashing down, as the doctor could not confirm exactly what he was dealing with.



To The Skin

It wasn’t your average cyst and was 24 centimeters thick and attached to her stomach. This finally explained her gaining weight, but her life remained in danger. Measures had to be taken immediately.

What Exactly Is An Ovarian Cyst?

Essentially a cyst is a fluid-filled sac that can develop on a woman’s ovary. They are extremely common and usually don’t cause harm, and most often disappear on their own. But, not for Katie.

Oddly Large

The only situations where a cyst can interfere with a person’s life is when it ruptures, blocks the blood supply to the ovaries, or in this case, is very large. Katie’s was really large, no…extremely large!



Exploring Her Options

One month later, Katie was speaking to a specialist who went over the options available for her. The image of the consultant’s face is still ingrained in her brain. He was in utter shock at her belly.

Complete Shock

Although he calmly explained to her that she had a large ovarian mass, his face revealed the truth. He was completely shocked. No one could have expected the size of the cyst, even the specialist.



That’s Not All

The doctor said it was possible that there were multiple cysts, and that they could be attached to organs. Katie couldn’t believe it, and yet, she knew that at this point the only option was surgery.

The Effects

Although they had ruled out the other explanations, they still were unclear the effect the cyst had on her body. She definitely had side effects, and of course, they had nothing to do with being pregnant.



You’re Fine

Although the doctor was unsure of what/how big the cyst was, he decided that there was something that had to be done. He couldn’t believe all of Katie’s other doctors had turned her away with a “you’re fine” response.



One Thing For Certain

One thing her doctor was certain of was that she would lose one ovary. In addition, depending on the location of the cyst, she may be hospitalized for longer. Katie felt like she was signing her life away.



Support

Katie’s mother lives in Australia so she decided not to tell her about this whole situation, not to worry her. But since the mystery was finally solved, she felt it was time to let the family know.

All Alone

At this point, it was too much for her to go through this alone so she called her mom and her sisters to be by her side. Katie had battled alone for the majority of this medical situation, but she felt it was enough.



Ready To Go

Within two days her mother arrived, but unfortunately, her dad had to stay back in Australia. Even with the time difference, he was always just a phone call away. She had all the support she needed and was ready for the dreadful day.



Going Under

The doctor informed Katie that in 4 weeks’ time she would be set for surgery. The time finally arrived and Katie was ready for surgery. In the short time between her initial consultation and surgery, her stomach grew another five inches.

Emergency Surgery

The high-risk obstetrics consultant she was referred to said surgery was a must and that he was going to cut her open from her chest bone down to her pelvic bone, like an old fashion C-section. Those were some comforting words!

March 9th, 2017

The day finally came in a blink of an eye. Katie was handed a surgery gown and a pair of socks. She put them on and was taken by the nurse. Her body was paralyzed knowing that at any minute a giant needle would be stabbed into her body.



Extra Help

Katie was so uneasy and difficult that she needed to be held down by two nurses. She wouldn’t stop moving and they needed to put the needle inside her. She says she really felt like she was dying.



And The Wait Continues

The doctors expected the surgery would only take an hour or so. But it took five! Her family patiently awaited the end, fearing for Katie’s life. However, the doctors managed to remove the cyst.

Back To Normal

The cyst was enormous, but the weight blew everyone away. Finally, this ginormous thing was removed from Katie’s body. She couldn’t wait to be back to her normal self again!



Minutes To Hours

She was extremely terrified but knew this was the way to get back to her old life. The surgery was supposed to last 90 minutes, but hours passed by before she was finished. Her friends and family waited in angst.



How Big?

The cyst came out to 60 pounds! If you struggle with understanding how much 60 pounds is, then it’s equivalent to seven babies! Katie woke from surgery surrounded by the hospital staff showing her pictures of what was inside her for so many months.

Treated Like A Celebrity

Katie was overwhelmed and confused when she woke up from surgery. “I remember still being groggy from the anesthetic as they wheeled me back to the ward and excited hospital staff was shoving photos in front of me,” said Katie.

After Surgery

The cyst accounted for one-third of Katie’s body weight and she began to realize the impact it had on her life. She couldn’t do the things that were once so normal for her. It was a real burden on her life.

Losing The Cyst

Once she was lacking this excess weight she noticed that it was making easy tasks in her life seem difficult, like driving a car or walking upstairs. Losing this cyst essentially brought her back to life.



Nickname

She was in utter disbelief that she was carrying so much weight around! After seeing the photos she said that “It looked like a massive pile of ice cream so I called it Mr. Whippy!”

Medical Mystery

The doctors were blown away by the size of Katie’s cyst. She was a true medical phenomenon! She along with the entire medical staff could not believe what was living inside her for so long.

Back Home

Katie was released four days later and had the support of her mother and boyfriend. Although she was dreading this process, the after effect made it all worthwhile. Smith doesn’t even remember life without an extra 60 kg!

Her Reminder

Katie has a 30- centimeter scar that extends from her sternum to her pelvis from the surgery. Not long after the procedure, she was already able to walk around easily. She couldn’t wait to start her new life with all the changes it brought. One drawback of the surgery was that Katie lost her right ovary, but the doctors informed her that this wouldn’t affect her having children.

Body Changes

Aside from her scar, Katie’s stomach is also covered in stretch marks, which are daily reminders of this experience. Regardless, Katie prefers the stretch marks to a 60-pound lump growing in her stomach.

A New Katie

Katie’s family came to visit her soon after the surgery and they were shocked to see her new appearance. She was so thin, basically half the woman she was before the surgery! Katie was so happy to be back to herself.

Smooth Sailing

Katie recollects on her recover and says it has been more or less smooth sailing, with some hiccups along the way. She says that her health is definitely much better than last year, both physically and mentally.

Saying Thanks

She has singled out her family, friends, and coworkers to say thank you for all their help during her recovery. Katie says she doesn’t think she could have done this without them and tells herself how lucky she is every day for her support network.



Inspirational

A year ago, Katie would never have shared her story. However, since then she has only grown more comfortable in her body. She is now sharing her story and is a true inspiration to us all!



There’s Hope

Despite going through this difficult experience and the reminder from her scar and stretch marks, Smith finally has her life back and has been reassured she will still be able to have children without her right ovary. She is so thankful for her surgeon.

Alexandra & Antonin

Alexandra Kinova and her husband Antonin Kroscen had plans to create a family and they were unprepared for what was about to happen. They figured they had some time before starting their family together, but then they discovered that she was pregnant with twins. Unfortunately, one doctor’s visit revealed something unexpected…

Happy To Be Expecting

Alexandra and her partner Antonin, a couple from the Czech republic were very excited when they heard that they were expecting a child. This is normal for any couple, but they were unprepared for what was coming for them.

Ready For Parenthood

Although she was only 23, she wasn’t afraid of the future. Since she was already the mother of her child, she knew what to expect going forward. Little did she know that she was completely unprepared for what life had in store.

She Thought It Was Under Control

She figured her second pregnancy would be easy since she had already done it once before. Unfortunately, after visiting the doctor, she realized that this couldn’t be further from the truth. But what did they tell her?

More Than She Thought

While she was ready to have one child, she soon learned that she was having twins. It wasn’t that having twins was such an unusual concept, but this birth alone was about to be legendary and nobody knew at the time.

Completely Unaware

The possibilities were endless. Was she pregnant with an alien? Was Antonin not the father? The truth could be anything, but at least the ultrasound would help her understand in some way what was going on.

A Follow-Up

The first ultrasound was just like any other and Kinova simply saw that she was pregnant. The doctors were pleased that she was healthy and had no impression that something unsettling would be found in the second one.

Even The Doctors Didn’t Know

Kinova visited the doctor once more and this time she learned some new information and within several weeks they found a heartbeat. But not just one.. this was not what they were planning for.

Double The Fun

After Kinova had her ultrasound she learned she had twins in her belly. The couple was in complete shock. They were already parents of 1 and now they were about to be the parents of three. They had no clue what was coming.

The Preparations

They spent the upcoming months planning and preparing for their twins. They purchased baby clothes and furniture to keep their babies comfortable. While they thought they were doing everything right, they were completely unaware of what was to come.

Unaware Of The Truth

In between her check-ups, everything seemed to be going as planned and Kinova did not expect anything out of the ordinary. While she was having twins, this still wasn’t unheard of to happen to a mother.

Something’s Not Right

She was getting deeper into her pregnancy and she could sense that something wasn’t completely right. She waited anxiously for her next appointment and told herself that she would be okay in the meantime.

Finally The Truth

When it came time for her next doctor’s appointment, they looked at her records and also at Kimova and were a bit confused. There was something about her that seemed slightly off. They decided to order a second ultrasound to get to the bottom of it.

Her Husband Was Completely Lost

Her partner was with her through everything and was present at all doctor’s appointments. He certainly could have never predicted what to find in the ultrasound nor for his new responsibilities.

Staying Positive

Kinova’s doctor and husband were becoming more concerned about her, despite this, she always remained calm and collective. She had been taking good care of herself ever since she found out she was pregnant and never missed a chance to take her vitamins. While she did not doubt that her babies would be healthy, her doctor made her think the opposite.

The Doctor’s Would Say Differently

Kinova was brought to the hospital for her doctor’s visit and she listened as doctors spoke in quite tons about her pregnancy. She didn’t understand the secrecy and the fact that they didn’t notice she was standing right there.

Concerned For Her Newborns

Her doctors’ faces said it all and gave her cause for panic. She was trying her best to stay positive but the moment she stepped into the doctor’s office that all chance. After her check-up that day she would understand why her doctor was becoming concerned about her.

The Opposite Of What They Thought

Going for an ultrasound was normal for an expecting mother but the reason the doctors were so concerned was because of how much her stomach had grown in such a short time. Finally, the doctors broke the news and the couple could not believe their ears.

Expecting The Worst

The doctors broke the news that she was not carrying twins so she immediately assumed that one of the babies passed away. It happens sometimes where one twin eats the other but, that was not what happened in her situation.

Looking For The Answers

Now she knew she wasn’t expecting twins, but what was it that she was expecting? She was starting to think that she wasn’t pregnant and maybe she just had a strange tumor that couldn’t stop growing. What they found hadn’t been seen in over 500 years.

Fearing For Her Future

Kinova wasn’t sure what exactly was going on and she was getting more concerned about her health. She was following everything exactly how she was supposed to and was eating correctly. She was so upset to think that she may lose her babies.

The Doctors Couldn’t Believe It

By taking one look the doctors could tell that Kinova’s pregnancy wasn’t the norm for a woman expecting twins. Her stomach was increasing at an unusual speed that wasn’t even normal for a woman expecting triplets. The ultrasound offered some help but they still didn’t have all the answers they were hoping for.

Just More Questions

It was hard to tell what exactly was going from the ultrasound. It was clear she was not just expecting twins, but they were still not entirely just how many children she was going to have. Wow, that must have been unsettling for Kinova.

Not Twins

The doctors broke the news that she wasn’t having twins and her heart sank to her stomach. This is the worst news to hear when your expecting twins, it makes a mother feel like they are no longer carrying a child. However, the truth was completely the opposite.

No Official Number

The doctors informed her that she wasn’t having twins or triplets. This seemed confusing, especially since she had not gone through any type of fertility treatment and so she wasn’t likely of having multiple births. It seemed that anything was possible at this point.

The Party Is Coming

The doctors confirmed amongst themselves and then confirmed with Kinova that she was having quadruplets. She was baffled by this, especially since she was already surprised to hear she was having twins! Now they were about to have a full house with 5 children! Finally, the surprises were over… or that’s what they thought.

More To Come

The couple rushed back to the store to buy more items for their new babies. Now they had everything they needed for four babies. However, when they went in for another checkup, the ultrasound revealed something entirely.

Another One Joins The Party

Alexandra and her husband Antonin were getting used to the idea of having four babies when they saw something in the ultrasound. Now they weren’t just having two babies or four, but instead, they were having five!

One Was Hiding

The doctors did not see the fifth baby right away because of all the fetuses in Kinova’s belly. They were all moving around and it was difficult to get a clear picture. Suddenly they noticed something else in the scan… Was it possible that there was a sixth baby?

Gender Reveal

Although she wasn’t expecting sixth babies, now that she was ready for it she still wanted to know if they would be boys or girls. She needed to know what she should be prepared in terms of outfits and colors, but the doctors could not give her those answers just yet.

The Big Day

Kinova was going to have to wait for the day to find out the genders of her babies. Kinova went into labor and 40 people were waiting in the waiting room for her and the quintuplets. It was clear that a lot could go wrong with so many babies involved but maybe her life was being threatened as well.

Calling For Help

The hospital staff and doctors on call were not used to so many births at once and they needed all the hands they could have. They even asked a cameraman to come in to capture the experience on film. There was barely room for Kinova’s own family or husband!

All Hands On Deck

As soon as they popped out, each baby was looked after by two nurses. They had to check their vitals and make sure everything was running smoothly since there were so many births at once. All nurses were called in to monitor the babies.

Safety Comes First

Given her situation, Kinova was forced to have a C-section. She was told that this would be the most responsible and secure method to make the babies were delivered in the safest way possible, without any problems.

The Little One

All of the babies required attention, but the littlest one needed a bit of extra support. Kinova and her babies spent several days in the hospital until they were taken home and ready to start a new life together.

A Family Of Five

All of the births went smoothly and they now had a big happy family of five. The real question was now how many boys and how many girls the couple ended up having! Truthfully, as long as they all came out safely is really what we care about.

Mommies Move-In

Their house was about to get a bit fuller with 5 babies in addition to Kinova’s mother and her husband’s mother. They came to help the parents bring the babies home from the hospital but also moved into their home to offer further assistance. That’s not all they did, but they also asked the government for assistance since the babies soon became national news.

Record-Breaking News

Alexandra and Antonin were so happy with their family of eight had four boys, who were named Daniel, Alex, and Martin. The fifth was the only girl named Terezka. Turns out she even broke a record.

Special Babies

Alena Makarova was an obstetrician in the room and she did some research after the birth and discovered that this birth story was part of history. It was obvious that giving birth to 5 babies was a big deal, yet it wasn’t clear what it was that made them so special.

Rare Kind

The obstetrician was interviewed by the Telegraph and she explained that there had never been a mention of quintuplets, and she had all the records since 1949. Essentially, Kinova was the first mother to give birth to five children in the whole area.

Quadruplets Are Just As Rare

In the Czech Republic, it has been found that quintuplets are born only once every 480 years. The chances of giving birth to quadruplets here are one in seven million. They decided to look at these statistics around the world.

Vitro Fertilization

Giving birth to quintuplets is usually rare and is due to fertility treatment like In Virto Fertilization. However, Kinova conceived these babies naturally and the answer is probably found in her genes.

Family Connection

Kinova and Kroscen both explained that twins are common in their families. Since they run in both of their families, it is not completely surprising that they gave birth to quintuplets. Wow, five babies, that most be tiring!

Several Connections

Their family was receiving many donations and helping hands for their large family. Aside from financial support, they also had their family and friends who were willing to lend a hand wherever they could.

Financial Support

As soon as people started to hear about the quints’ birth, people from around the world wanted to help any way that they could, including with donations. This type of news is pretty rare and everyone was interested in helping raise money any way that they could.

Help From The Government

Unfortunately, the family couldn’t access outside donations because the government agreed to prove the family with assistance. They sent them a nanny, but over time they would see that this was not sufficient with 6 children.

Access Denied

The system had never experienced a situation like Kinova and her family before so they denied providing extra government assistance. The Czech Social Affairs Ministry announced a statement saying “Simply put, our system is not prepared for such multiple instances of ‘good luck.’”

Strong Family

Although the family has gone through many obstacles they are still extremely happy to be raising their children and are excited to celebrate each birthday and celebration that their family of five shares together.

Too Much For Her

While it was certainly difficult taking care of five babies, Kinova and her husband have shown that you achieve anything as long as you put your mind to it. Given the condition, they were born in to, these babies have a 95% chance of growing up healthy and every day live the risk.

Milestones

Five years later and Kinova is still as energetic and loving as she was when the quintuplets were born. She is also motivated because her situation is extremely uncommon. The likelihood of conceiving quintuplets is one in 48 million pregnancies. There around 800 quintuplets around the world and 130 were conceived randomly.

Big Happy Family

Time has passed since Alexandra learned that she was going to give birth to quintuplets and she didn’t ever foresee a life with so much love and happiness. All she knows for sure is that she has no plans having more children, despite her immense love for her children.",Her Pregnancy Revealed Something Out Of The Ordinary

The father needed a new kidney and the teacher donated one to him. ,https://web.archive.org/web/20170828141323/https://boreddaddy.com/teacher-unthinkable-help-4-year-old-father/?utm_source=glad,"A teacher is usually the second most important adult in a child’s life.

Nancy Bleur is a lovely and caring 54-year-old kindergarten teacher from Iowa. She absolutely adores her students and goes out of her way to make them happy.

One day she noticed that 4-year-old Camden in her class wasn’t his usual self. She decided to have a little chat with him to see what was up. That’s when the boy started telling her about his father… and it made her heart sink. She felt like she had to do something – and fast.

Turns out Camden’s father, 34-year-old Darreld Petersen, was very sick. When Nancy realised just how bad, it made her even more worried as she couldn’t bare the thought of how it was affecting little Camden. That’s when she decided to call the dad up.

There was something seriously wrong with Darreld’s kidneys that made them function at just 20 percent of their capacity. During his dialysis treatment, he looked so sick that poor Camden was terrified when he saw his daddy.

Nancy decided she wanted to help the family in any way she could. You might think she offered to babysit, help with the groceries, cook or any other daily chore – but Nancy went much further than that in lending her hand.

She offered Darreld one of her kidneys.

Miraculously, she happened to be a perfect match, meaning all she had to do was to quickly fill in some paper work.

“I was really excited about it. I was ecstatic. I don’t know what I would’ve done for closure if I wasn’t [a match],” she says.

Camden’s dad was shocked and delighted with Nancy’s extraordinary offer. She would be saving his life.

“It’s just amazing. There are people waiting every day for a kidney, for an organ in general. I wish there were more people like her. She’s giving me a second chance at life,” Darreld told ABC News.

When the family found out that Nancy’s kidney was a match with Darreld’s, they decided to surprise her with flowers at school. Camden couldn’t be happier about the fact that his teacher is helping save his father’s life.

The world is full of good people! If everyone were as selfless as Nancy, the world would be a better place. Now let’s hope that the operation runs smoothly and that they both have a speedy recovery

Please share this article if you were also touched by Nancy’s lovely gift to Camden’s dad.

Plane tires can handle thousands of pounds of weight and high speeds — and it's mostly due to how they're made.

A combination of sturdy materials and nitrogen create a tire strong enough to handle the rigorous conditions upon landing.

Goodyear, one of the leading manufacturers of plane tires, gave us a look inside its factory to see how it ensures tires are up to its standards.

Following is a transcript of the video.

Narrator: If you dropped a watermelon at 170 mph, it would be a mess. Strap over 500,000 pounds to its back and it would be, well, nothing.

But airplane tires manage that impact every day, without incident. They're made to withstand hitting the pavement at extreme speeds, all while supporting an entire commercial jet. Don't think too hard about it next time you're in the air, but 45 inches of rubber is the only thing standing between you and the tarmac during landing.

So, what makes them tough enough for the job?

If you've ever driven down a US highway, you've probably seen shredded tires along the way. Semitruck tires aren't supposed to explode, but they do. Airplane tires? Not so much. There are a few differences between the two.

First of all, a semitruck isn't falling out of the sky as part of its route. Those tires don't need to be made to withstand the same high speeds and weights. Airplane tires, on the other hand, need to be reinforced.

Brandy Moorhead: They're made with a combination of proprietary synthetic rubber compounds, which are paired with aluminum steel reinforcements and nylon and aramid fabrics.

Narrator: That's Brandy. She's in charge of Goodyear's aircraft tires, and she told us that airplane tires are inflated twice as much as truck tires and six times as much as a car's. That's because the higher the pressure, the firmer the tire, and the more strength it has to support the plane. And when they're inflated, it's not with regular air. Airplane tires are filled with nitrogen.

Brandy: Nitrogen is an inert gas, so high temperatures and pressure changes have less effect.

Narrator: Plane tires are subjected to the most rigorous conditions of any vehicle tire. When Goodyear develops a new airplane tire, it starts with a prototype. Then the tires are tested beyond their breaking points. They're tested for speed, pressure, and the ability to handle a load up to 38 tons. So they have to be made very differently than other tires. Instead of the blocky design seen on a lot of car tires, plane tires get groovy.

Brandy: That blocked pattern enables different maneuvering and different characteristics of ride and handling, which are required by an automobile, as opposed to just an aircraft that takes off and lands on a runway. The reason we have grooves in an aircraft tire at all is because we need to evacuate water if we were to land on a wet surface.

Narrator: Commercial jets usually have around 20 tires and touch down about 500 times before they have to be retread, which can be done seven times before the tire's no better than scrap rubber. And tires at the nose of the plane tend to have shorter life spans than the rest.

It takes two mechanics up to an hour to change a single tire. They raise the tire only 5 centimeters off the ground, which doesn't feel like enough room to fit a thumb, let alone change a plane tire. The mechanics take off the hubcap and reduce the tire pressure from 200 to 30 psi, which reduces the risk of it exploding as the bolts and nuts holding it on the plane are removed. A sleeve protects the axle, and a lifting tool pulls the tire off. The axle sleeve is then greased, and the new tire is slid smoothly on. And then things move in reverse: nuts and bolts, tire reinflated to 200, hubcap back on, and the whole thing is gently lowered 5 centimeters back onto the ground.

So, what happens after 500 landings, seven retreadings, and uncountable ""This is your captain speaking""s? A lot of the tires get recycled into playground mulch and even other tires for farming equipment. Those tires will be made from old plane tires, but not like them. There's no need. Because if a farmer is using their tractor the same way they'd use a plane, well, they're doing it wrong.

You'd die. ,https://www.iflscience.com/space/can-you-stand-on-a-gas-giant-like-jupiter/,"We are so used to picturing us humans on Earth's surface (and maybe soon Mars) that when we see a planet like Jupiter, one of the first questions that comes to mind is ""Can we stand on it?""

Let’s for a moment ignore the extreme conditions (gravity, atmospheric pressure, high temperature, and winds) that are found on the giant planet, and let’s just descend through the atmosphere. What we’d see is a spectacle like no other.

Far beneath Jupiter's atmosphere is a gigantic ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen, which would look and behave like mercury except that hydrogen has 60 percent the density of water. So, you would have to sink for tens of thousands of kilometers to reach a hot, molten, rocky core that's possibly solid.

The interior of Jupiter is not precisely mapped – that is one of the scientific goals of the Juno mission, which has just reached Jupiter. The probe will use precise gravitational and electromagnetic measurements to map what goes on underneath Jupiter’s clouds.

I know that the answer so far is not really satisfying, so let’s drop the pretense of a magical observer and let’s dive into Jupiter with current technologies.

Jupiter is really warm, with the top of its atmosphere at about 900 Kelvins (630°C / 1,160°F). As we fly down through the atmosphere, the temperature quickly drops as the pressure and wind speed increase. Following what happened to the Galileo probe, which dived into Jupiter in 1995, things start going badly for electronics 58 minutes into our exploration and 156 kilometers (97 miles) into the atmosphere. For the Galileo probe, this combination of pressure (23 atmospheres) and temperature (153°C / 307°F) proved deadly.

But it's been 20 years, so let's assume we can continue down. At 500 kilometers (310 miles), the visibility is almost completely gone and the thick ammonia clouds swirl all around us, with wind speeds of around 100 meters (330 feet) per second.

Underneath the ammonia clouds, there are more water clouds and more complex atmospheric effects that Juno will hopefully clarify. Current technology will have been pulverized by now, and our remains will now be traveling to a layer of supercritical fluid hydrogen – something not quite a gas but not exactly a liquid either.

After about 2.5 hours of exploration, we will have reached the liquid metallic hydrogen ocean. Heavy elements might reach the center after many more hours of falling. So, you couldn't exactly stand on this ocean. But below this, it's thought Jupiter may indeed have a rocky core, perhaps somewhat similar to terrestrial planets. Juno will help answer this question during its mission.

Jupiter has most of the planetary mass of the Solar System, and could easily fit all the other planets in its interior. There's a reason why it is the planetary king of the Solar System.",What Would Happen If You Tried To Stand On Jupiter?
"Sugar, caffeine, and carbonation. ","https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/health/soda-soft-drinks-addictive-drayer-food-wellness/index.html#:~:text=The%20fizz%20factor&text=In%20fact%2C%20carbonation%20makes%20any,reward%E2%80%9D%20feeling%2C%20Wenk%20explained.","(CNN) Slashing soft drinks from your diet is a quick way to improve your health and lose weight -- that much you probably already know.

But actually giving up your soda habit isn't always an easy task. While some people can function just fine without soft drinks, others find they need their fix starting at breakfast.

And we're not only talking about the sugary kind. For some, a daily soda ritual includes chugging multiple cans of artificially sweetened beverages, which aren't much better

So what is it about soda -- both regular and diet -- that makes it so addictive?

According to Gary Wenk, director of neuroscience undergraduate programs at the Ohio State University and author of ""Your Brain on Food,"" it's all in the beverage's design. Your favorite brand of soft drink is engineered with just the right amount of sweetener, caffeine and carbonation to make you continuously want to grab and gulp.

The sugar factor

But that rush of sweetness also appears to activate the same reward centers in the brain as drugs, Wenk explained. It triggers the release of the brain chemical dopamine in a region known as the nucleus accumbens , and as a result we feel euphoria.

""The sugar in the drinks ... swish through the brain, you get the dopamine rewarding you, and then the effect of the dopamine surge is gone almost as fast as it arrived, leaving your brain wanting more,"" Wenk said.

In fact, one review concluded that sugar can even be more rewarding and attractive than cocaine.

But satisfying that desire for more sugar can lead to larger cravings.

""The more soda you drink, the bigger the 'reward,' and as would happen with most pleasurable things, we develop an affinity and want even more of them,"" said Cordialis Msora-Kasago, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

A caffeine kick

Sugar isn't the only ingredient to blame when it comes to soda's addictive qualities.

There's also caffeine, which is a stimulant -- ""and our brain craves things that stimulate it,"" he continued. Caffeine not only speeds up our thinking but also has its own unique ability to activate reward pathways that involve dopamine, according to Wenk.

""Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychostimulants in the world ... and it does have an addictive property,"" said Dr. Marilyn Cornelis, an assistant professor of preventative medicine at Northwestern University. ""[With soda], we're getting the sugar high combined with caffeine, and that is quite a good feeling that might cause you to consume more the next day or another time.""

When consumed regularly, people often start to rely on caffeine to increase attentiveness, alertness and energy, according to Msora-Kasago. ""They may feel dependent upon it and even experience signs of withdrawal, such as headaches and poor concentration, when they do not have it,"" she said.

The fizz factor

There's yet another element that plays a very significant role in soda's lure: the fizz. ""If you take Coca-Cola and sit it on the countertop for a day or so, how much would you enjoy drinking it?"" Wenk said.

In fact, carbonation makes any drink much more addictive, according to Wenk.

Those bubbles add a small amount of acidity, which when combined with sugar intensifies the euphoric ""reward"" feeling, Wenk explained. Carbonation also has the ability to make sugar take a bit of a back seat -- which is not to say that sugar doesn't still exert its pleasurable effects, but that the bubbles blunt the sweet taste just enough to make you crave even more.

No sugar, same problems

Although diet sodas replace real sugar with artificial sweeteners, those may have their own addictive characteristics. According to Msora-Kasago, they trigger taste receptors that register the sweetness and expect sugar, essentially preparing the brain for a reward that never comes.

And when ""the brain doesn't get the reward it wants from its drink -- the real sugar -- it says, 'go out and get me some more,' "" Wenk said.

And, as with regular soda, the carbonation compounds the effect of artificial sweeteners -- dulling the taste just enough to intensify our cravings and have us cracking open another can.

Rituals and genes

But why do some people seem to crave soda after soda, while others can have just one and be satisfied? It may have to do with some of the ritual aspects of soda drinking, which also play a role in our brain's chemistry. Everything from hearing the pop and the fizz of the carbonation to seeing the words ""diet"" written on a can -- an aspect of reward in itself for engaging in what is perhaps considered a ""virtuous"" behavior -- can increase the activity of dopamine cells.

""Even before you get that first dose of caffeine in your brain, you are already feeling the reward,"" Wenk said.

And that expectation helps establish a habit. ""[People] are studying late at night, driving home or heading into a meeting, and that can of soda is the one thing that keeps them alert and engaged,"" Msora-Kasago said.

Diet soda in particular may become habit-forming when it's seen as the ""healthier"" choice. For example, it's common to replace a regular soda habit with diet soda, which reduces calorie intake without giving up the actual soda habit, Msora-Kasago explained.

And at least one study suggests that there may be genetic underpinnings related to our desire to consume sweet beverages. In the study, people who had a variant in a gene known as FTO -- which has previously been linked to a lower risk of obesity -- surprisingly had an affinity for sweetened beverages.

""People with this FTO variant are more likely to drink more soda,"" explained Cornelis, who co-authored the study. Though the link to lower obesity risk is counterintuitive, it is ""a similar trend observed by other scientists"" and something researchers are still trying to understand, according to Cornelis. About 20 to 30% of the population has the genetic variant.

Kicking the can

If you're having a soft drink on occasion -- say a few times per month -- there's no need for concern. But if you're having more than one soda per day, you could be putting yourself at risk for health conditions that include obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, according to Msora-Kasago. And drinking diet soda comes with risks too: consuming just one can per day has been linked to increased risk of stroke and dementia

""The key is finding (another) beverage that you enjoy,"" Msora-Kasago said. ""Unsweetened milk is always a great place to start because in addition to quenching thirst, milk provides many important nutrients such as protein and calcium.""

For a lower-calorie option, you can enjoy a cup of unsweetened tea, which adds flavor and gives a boost of disease fighting antioxidants.

And water remains the tried and true beverage for better health. If you don't like still water, Msora-Kasago recommends finding an unsweetened sparkling water that you enjoy, or making your own spritzer by mixing three parts of sparkling water with one part fruit or vegetable juice.

If you're drinking soda for an energy boost during the day, you may want to check in on your sleep. Research suggests that there may be a link between sleeping less than 5 hours per day and drinking more sugary, caffeinated sodas, Msora-Kasago explained.

But whether getting enough sleep will actually discourage you from reaching for that can of cola is much less definitive. ""The well-rested brain will encourage you to drink as much soda as a sleepy brain,"" Wenk said.",Why soda is so addictive -- and some good alternative beverages

Pampers

How many diapers does a baby really need in the first 3 months? About a million.When I read in my pregnancy and parenting books that a newborn will go through 7–12 diapers a day at first, I didn't believe it. I could not imagine changing that many diapers and how repetitive and exhausting that would be. If you have kids, you know where this story is going. The books were right and newborns really do go through that many diapers!The unique liner helps your baby feel dry and keeps them comfortable. For good sleepers (in my dreams), the diaper offers up to 12 hours of overnight protection.My absolute favourite feature about Pampers Swaddlers is the colour-changing wetness indicator that lets you know when your baby needs to be changed. A yellow line means the diaper is dry, and a blue line means it's wet. Easy peasy. This is especially useful for middle of the night feedings where you want to quickly check if baby's diaper needs to be changed or not.The first days at home with a baby are a jumbled and blurred mix of changing diapers, feeding and burping, putting your baby to sleep, rinsing and repeating. It was months before I would only need to change my little one's diaper 6 or 8 times a day. Usually it was closer to 10 times.I did the calculations so you can see exactly how many you might need in those first few months:That's a lot of diapers!With that many diapers going on your little bundle of joy, using the right brand is important. I prefer Pampers Swaddlers because I can feel confident that my baby will stay comfortable and dry. And I really love that little blue line.",How many diapers does a baby really need in the first 3 months?
Yes. ,https://www.howtogeek.com/442418/is-the-mac-pro-overpriced-compared-to-a-pc/,"Apple’s Mac Pro will be made in the USA with a starting price of $6,000. You get a pretty sweet machine for that price, but how close could you get to the power of the Mac Pro if you tried to build a Windows version yourself?

You Could Build a PC With Similar Hardware for Less

No surprise: By our calculations, you can get the job done for much less, though it’ll still cost you. We weren’t able to make a carbon copy of the Mac Pro, but we did get some advantages that the base model Mac Pro doesn’t have. We also had to give up some features in the process.

For this article, we’re focusing on the base model since it’s the only one with a known price at this writing. We have no idea what the upper models will cost, so there’s nothing to compare it to, price-wise. If you want to see a nice example of a killer Windows machine that goes head-to-head with the best Mac Pro, check out this video by Linus Tech Tips.

Before we get into our base model, one last note. We did not build this machine ourselves. So this is not a build guide. It’s more of a thought experiment. Enough preamble—let’s dive in.

The CPU and Motherboard

Apple doesn’t specify which Xeon W CPU it’s using in the base model of the Mac Pro, but we do know it has eight cores, 16 threads, and a turbo boost of 4GHz. Looking at Intel’s ark listings, that is similar to the Xeon W-3223—although the cache is a little larger on the Mac Pro CPU. The W-3223 has an MSRP of $749 but is not available on major sites like Newegg or Amazon.

So we swapped it out with something close to its specs, the Xeon W-2145. That’s a Skylake part from late 2017. It has eight cores, 16 threads, but a higher boost at 4.5GHz. Nevertheless, it has the advantage of being available, though just barely, and as an OEM part. That means it comes without a cooler and the warranty is shorter. That’s not great for an actual purchase, but for a thought experiment, it’ll do.

Here is where we hit difficulty number two: Apple’s Mac Pro motherboard is a pretty sweet custom build with enough capacity for eight PCIe lanes, two Thunderbolt 3 ports in the back, and two 10G LAN ports.

To try and get close to all this we’re going with the Asus WS C422 Sage/10G. This is a single-CPU motherboard with seven full-size PCIe slots, two dual 10G LAN ports, and an M.2 slot.

Based on the best prices we can find we’ve spent $1,290 at B&H Photo on the CPU. We can find lower prices on Amazon, but they are through third-party sellers without Amazon fulfillment. That means if there are any issues you’re relying on the seller’s customer service policy, not Amazon’s. It’s better to go with a known quantity when buying online, in our opinion.

As for the motherboard, you can pick that up for $749.76 from Newegg.

Finally, we need a CPU cooler since we didn’t get one with our Xeon. So we’ll pick-up the Noctua NH-D15 for $89.95

Total so far: $2,129.71

Already, we can see the costs are adding up. We could’ve gone cheaper by swapping out for a different Intel Xeon, but the point is to try and match the Mac Pro as best we can. For that reason we can’t go with an Intel Core i part, because those are consumer- and enthusiast-grade CPUs that don’t support the boatload of PCIe lanes that you get with Xeon chips—a key requirement for a workstation.

The GPU

This part is easy. The base model is rocking an AMD Radeon Pro 580X with 36 compute units, 2304 stream processors, 8GB of GDDR5 memory. We’ll throw caution to the wind here and pick up the non-pro Sapphire Radeon Nitro+ RX 590 for $216. This card has 8GB of GDDR5, 2304 stream processors, and 36 compute units. The Mac Pro has six inputs (two HDMI, and four DisplayPort), while the Nitro+ has two HDMI, two DisplayPort, and one DVI. You’re short by one port (two if you hate DVI), but it’s close enough.

You know, what? Let’s double up on the GPUs. Apple’s Mac Pro has this magic Afterburner Pro Res card, so let’s use that as an excuse to double up and use some of those PCIe slots.

Total so far: $2,561.71

Thunderbolt 3

Ugh. Thunderbolt 3. Here’s the deal. Apple is in love with Thunderbolt and widely supports it. Outside the realm of the Mac, however, Thunderbolt 3 on desktops is not as big. The C422 Sage only has one Thunderbolt 3 header on the motherboard. So we’re limited to a single Asus ThunderboltEX 3 add-in card, and of course, it only has one Thunderbolt port. You can use multiple devices off that single port, mind you, but still, the dream of even just two Thunderbolt 3 ports is not happening.

We could try a different card, but Thunderbolt is, to borrow a phrase, a bag of hurt, so we won’t risk it. That card costs $79.04 and comes with a Thunderbolt port, a USB 3.1 port, and one DisplayPort.

Total so far: $2,631.71

RAM, Power supply, Storage, Cooling and Case

Now we’re getting closer to home. Crucial has 8GB 2666MHz ECC RAM that works with the C422. The 8GB modules are priced at $62, bringing our total RAM cost to $248.

Advertisement



For storage, the Mac Pro has a 250GB SSD. We’ve got a little wiggle room with pricing, and we want a really good SSD for this machine. Let’s go with the NVMe 512GB Samsung 970 Pro, which was on sale for $150 at this writing at Newegg.

Apple puts a 1.4 Kilowatt PSU in the Mac Pro so we’ll go with the fully modular EVGA Supernova 1600 T2 80+ Titanium power supply for $400. That’s a much bigger PSU than the Mac Pro has, but we have some breathing room on costs so let’s put it in.

Finally, we need a case. The C422 is a CEB form factor, which has the same mount points as an ATX motherboard. So as long as the case suits E-ATX and ATX, we should be fine. We won’t be able to get anything that looks like the Mac Pro “cheese grater” of course, but if there’s one thing the PC landscape doesn’t suffer for its choice in cases.

Our selection was the Corsair Crystal Series 680X RGB High Airflow case for $260. It’s a nice-looking, large case with four fans. The RGB fans may not be to everyone’s taste, but you can just turn off the LEDs if you like. The Mac Pro doesn’t have a special CPU cooler relying on the three fans and airflow cooling. So for this thought experiment, we’ll assume the high airflow case, and its fans will be enough (they probably won’t be).

Total: $3,689.71

Conclusion

So after everything we’re spending close to $3,700, far less than the $6,000 cost of the base model of the Mac Pro. So is this a clear example of the Apple Tax? Well, yes but let’s add some caveats. First, you’re always going to get it cheaper when you build it yourself. We also don’t have to factor in the costs of custom design that Apple had to with its motherboard, the proprietary connectors, and those MPX modules.

We are also missing some features such as the extra Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a “pro” designation on our GPUs. But we do have some advantages such as doubling up on GPUs, adding more storage for almost nothing, and a pretty sweet case.

Back to the Apple Tax, does it matter? To everyday consumers, it absolutely does, but this isn’t a consumer PC. To the workstation market, it doesn’t matter as much. If you’re a Mac shop, then Macs are what you want. That could be because the software you’re using just runs better on Macs, or your workflow is set up to accommodate the Apple ecosystem. And if you’ve been waiting for the Mac Pro “trash can” to go away before updating your machines, then the new Mac Pros are a welcome sight.

Still, there’s no question that the Mac Pro is awfully expensive, and only Apple could get away with this kind of pricing.",Is the Mac Pro Overpriced Compared to a PC?

Many superhero movies these days include an extra scene during or after the titles, but that's because films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Expanded Universe tie in with other flicks in the franchises. Joker, by contrast, is a standalone film that suggests its own version of the Batman origin story, but it's not tied into the continuity of other movies such as Justice League or the forthcoming Batman movie starring Robert Pattinson.

So the only reason to stick around is to listen to the strains of Send in the Clowns as the credits roll. You could turn to your buddies and discuss whether the movie leaves the Joker as a pathetic loser or a hero. Or you could read the names of the people who made the movie, such as makeup artist Nicki Ledermann who realized the Joker's iconic face paint.",Does Joker have a postcredits scene?
Soda. ,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/03/health/sugary-drinks-diet-sodas-soft-drink-linked-to-health-issues-wellness/index.html,"(CNN) Brace yourself, lovers of diet sodas and sugary drinks. It's more bad news and yet another reason to consider ditching your favorite soda or soft drink.

A new study followed more than 450,000 people from 10 European countries for up to 19 years and found those who drank two or more glasses of any type of soda a day had a higher risk of dying from any cause of death than people who drank less than a glass each month. None of the people had cancer, diabetes, heart disease or stroke before their participation.

The study, published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , found men and women who drank two or more glasses a day of sugar-sweetened soft drinks had a higher risk of dying from digestive disorders, while those who drank the same amount of diet drinks had higher risks of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The link to digestive disease in the study is interesting, said Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.

""Experimental evidence suggests that high blood sugar and high sugar intake can impair the gut barrier, leading to a 'leaky gut' and access to the gut immune system causing intestinal inflammation, alter gut microbiota and increase susceptibility to gut infections,"" she said. ""These pathways may increase susceptibility to digestive diseases.""

Total soft drink consumption in the study was also associated with an increased risk for Parkinson's disease, but not with Alzheimer's or cancer.

Soft drinks were defined as ""low calorie or diet fizzy soft drinks"", ""fizzy soft drinks,"" such as cola and lemonade, and ""fruit squash or cordials,"" which are non-alcoholic concentrated syrups typically mixed with sugar and water. In this study, one glass of soft drink was 8 fluid ounces, or 250 milliliters; the typical can of soda around the world holds 12 fluid ounces or 355 milliliters.

The end of a love affair?

This large, long-term study is yet another in a growing list of research that is sounding the alarm on our love affair with carbonated soft drinks.

In March, a study published in the journal Circulation used data from 80,500 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study and nearly 40,000 men from the Health Professionals study. It found that women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages -- defined as a standard glass, bottle or can -- had a 63% increased risk of premature death compared to women who drank them less than once a month. Men who did the same had a 29% increase in risk.

Those who consumed more than one sugary beverage per month but fewer than two per day seemed to experience a dose effect: The more they drank, the greater the risk.

Substituting one sugary beverage per day with an artificially sweetened one was found to lower the risk of premature death, but drinking four or more artificially sweetened beverages increased the risk of premature death from cardiovascular disease in women. The same effect was not seen for men, and it was not seen for the risk of dying from cancer.

Only an association

This study, as well as other research on the connection between diet and sugary beverages and health risks, is observational and cannot show cause and effect. That's a major limitation, researchers say, as it's impossible to determine whether the association is due to a specific artificial sweetener, a type of beverage, obesity or another hidden health issue.

""The cause behind these associations isn't clear,"" said Bergquist. ""Other potential biological causes could be attributed to experimental evidence linking consumption of artificial sweeteners to sugar cravings, appetite stimulation and glucose intolerance.""

Robert Rankin, president of the Calorie Control Council, a trade group for low-calorie and diet foods and beverages, said in a statement that ""low- and no-calorie sweeteners have a long safety record and are important tool for weight management and those managing diabetes. This study paints an inaccurate picture of the important role of these products for consumers.""

Surviving a broken heart

Association or not, you've decided to end the fling with your soft drink du jour (and avoid future infidelities). Good for you, literally. Here are some tips on how to do it with the least heartache.

Cut back correctly

Going cold turkey is tough and may set you up for failure. Instead, registered dietitian and CNN contributor Lisa Drayer suggests a gradual approach.

""Cut back by one serving per day until you're down to one drink per day,"" Drayer said. ""Then aim for one every other day until you can phase out soft drinks entirely.

""Alternate with seltzer/sparkling water can help you cut back,"" she added. ""Eventually you can replace soft drinks with seltzer or sparkling water if you are craving carbonation.""

Find a different fizz

Speaking of carbonation, for a lot of folks, the fix is the fizz. Find a carbonated seltzer water or mix a healthy fruit alternative with sparkling water. You can't go wrong with blueberry or pomegranate juice, said registered dietitian and nutritionist Rahaf Al Bochi, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

""The recommendation for fruit juice is usually 4 ounces a day, Al Bochi said.

One caution: Try to drink your bubbly with food, not alone, experts advise. Any type of carbonated water can erode the enamel on your teeth . That's because the carbon dioxide that turns water bubbly turns into carbonic acid in the mouth, which can be detrimental to the health of your teeth.

Stomp the sweet tooth

Bergquist suggests satisfying your sugar cravings by substituting naturally sweet foods such as fruits and dates, which contain ""health-promoting vitamins, minerals and bioactive chemicals called phytonutrients.""

""They package sugar with fiber which leads to a slow and steady, rather than sharp, rise in blood sugar,"" Bergquist said.

She also suggests committing to a no-sugar challenge for at least two weeks.

""Our taste buds turn over every two weeks,"" she said. ""That means that if you can get past the intense sugar cravings the first two weeks, your taste buds will adjust to find natural foods with sugar more satisfying.""

Hinder the habit

We are creatures of routine and ritual. Just like when a person might crave smoking (say after eating), figure out what your habitual trigger is and try to replace it. Bored at your desk? Call a friend before you reach for a soda.

Counter the caffeine

If you've not been drinking caffeine-free soda, then a good part of your addition to that soft drink is the caffeine buzz you're getting. Try substituting green or black tea instead, Al Bochi said.

""You'll get the caffeine boost you're looking for without the added sugar and you'll also be getting a good dose of antioxidants,"" she added.

""Herbal teas like hibiscus, passion fruit, berry, peppermint are flavorful and pleasing without contributing any sugar or calories,"" suggested Drayer.

Woo the water

Carry a water bottle with you or have a pitcher of ice cold water near your desk. If it's easily accessible to you, you are more likely to grab the water than a sugary beverage.

If you're not a fan of plain water, Drayer suggested adding a little sparkle.

""Try infusing fruit into water -- you can purchase a pitcher, fill it with water, then add slices of oranges, lemons, strawberries, watermelon or whatever fruit you like so the water will become infused with the fruit flavor and provide sweetness to your palate,"" she said.

Embrace the effort

And finally, allow yourself a slip now and then.

""Remember that drinking a sugary beverage every once in a while will not directly cause adverse health effects,"" said Al Bochi. ""Providing yourself permission to enjoy all beverages while being mindful with how it fits into your overall healthy eating pattern is the key to a healthy relationship with food.""",Want to live longer?

He's attracted to people's intelligence. ,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/entertainment/mark-ronson-sapiosexual-scli-intl-gbr/index.html,"London (CNN) Chart-topper Mark Ronson has come out as sapiosexual. In case you're not familiar with the term, it means being attracted to intelligence above other traits -- or, in other words, putting brains before looks or gender.

Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain on Thursday, he said: ""I feel like I identify as sapiosexual."" Anchors Ben Shephard and Kate Garraway congratulated him on being ""out and proud.""

Author Nichi Hodgson appeared on the show earlier, defending the term. ""The definition of sapiosexuality means intelligence first,"" she said.

""I have dated men, women, transmen, transwomen, and across the gender spectrum and identify now as bisexual,"" she added. ""The thing that has linked all these people has been their brains.""

"""Just stop."" ",https://time.com/5135513/rude-people-danny-wallace/,"Recently, the British IVF pioneer Lord Robert Winston was sitting on a train traveling from London, England, to Manchester, when he found himself becoming steadily enraged.

Winston is normally a fairly mild-mannered man, known for a big mustache and a friendly demeanor. But what was driving him slowly insane as the train rumbled through its two-hour journey was another passenger in particular. Ignoring the child with her, the woman had picked up her phone and begun what would become a very loud conversation, which would take place over several counties and be peppered with tedious facts and banal detail.

Lord Winston tried to ignore it. He did. But there is something fundamentally un-ignorable about a loud, one-sided conversation. Our brains fight to make sense of them, constantly jarred by sudden and randomly timed replies to sentences we can’t hear.

It was then that Lord Winston made a mistake. He began to tweet about the woman. He took photos of her and sent them out to his more than 40,000 followers. He became more and more red-faced and furious as her dominating chit-chat moved from 30 minutes, to 40, then 50, then an unbelievable hour.

When the train arrived at its destination, Winston bolted. He’d had enough of what he described as her “rudeness.” But the woman faced an unusual surprise. The press had picked up on Winston’s tweets. They were waiting for her on the platform, all big smiles and eager anticipation. And when they gleefully showed her the Lord’s messages, the woman’s face fell. And she too used just one word to describe Lord Winston’s actions that day: “rude.”

I’m sorry if this makes me a snowflake, but we find ourselves living at a time of incredible rudeness. Social media has taught the world it needs to have an opinion, on everything, at all times, and that this opinion must be delivered in a forthright way, so we seem assured, confident, smart. Reality television has taught us to celebrate meanness, so long as that meanness is delivered as “honesty” — an awful get-out clause designed by the truly rude so they can say truly rude things and then expect us all to applaud them for it. In Britain, Brexit has divided a people so distinctly that it feels we only need to know how a person voted on one issue to decide whether we like them or not. In the U.S., the rise of the world’s rudest man to the world’s most powerful position has brought into sharp and terrifying focus just how dangerous one moment of rudeness might prove: it might lead us to nuclear apocalypse.

So what can we do about the rising tide of rudeness? Well, we can have the guts to call it out. It’s our duty. Studies have shown that rudeness spreads quickly and virally, almost like the common cold. Just witnessing rudeness makes it far more likely that we, in turn, will be rude later on. Scientists have described it as a neurotoxin, and once infected by it we are more aggressive, less creative and worse at our jobs. The only way to end a strain is to make a conscious decision to do so.

Winston shone a spotlight on that woman’s behavior, but he did not confront it, and he did not stop it. Instead, that flickering spotlight was shone weakly from afar, shaming her, taking an almost rudimentary form of revenge on her.

And revenge is an interesting side effect of rudeness. When someone commits a crime against us — they rob our house, say — we don’t have any desire to rob their house in return. We want justice. But when someone is rude to us, it speaks to an arguably darker side: we want revenge. We want to make them feel the same disrespect they’ve given us. Sometimes we are simply rude in return. But situations can escalate. The rage and injustice we feel at the inexplicably rude behavior of a stranger can drive us to do odd things. In my own research, surveying 2,000 adults, I discovered that the acts of revenge people had taken ranged from the ridiculous (“I rubbed fries on their windshield”; “I let a dog lick a sausage I was serving them”) to the genuinely disturbing (“I slashed their tires”; “I sabotaged them at work”).

Often, the trick to handling rudeness is far more elegant, and can be done with the gentle delivery of a sentence as simple as “Just stop.”

Combating rudeness is something we must do face-to-face. When we see it happen in a store, we must step up and say “Just stop.” If it happens to a colleague, we must point it out. We must defend strangers in the same way we’d defend our best friends. But we can do it with grace. We can handle it well, by handling it without a trace of aggression and without being rude ourselves. Because once a rude person has had the looking glass held up to them and can see their actions through the eyes of others, they are far more likely to end that strain themselves.

This can be done by you, by me, by everyone. But it can also be done in spectacular ways.

The former Mayor of Bogotá, Antanas Mockus, had one such spectacular way. Realizing that behavior in his city was at an all-time low — people parking without thought, not lining up properly, snapping at each other — he had what might well prove one of the genius ideas of our age. He hired an army of mimes.

Yes, an army of mimes.

These mimes were unleashed onto the streets of Bogotá in their traditional mime costumes, and upon spotting rude behavior would simply stand behind that rude person and mimic their rude actions with startling accuracy. Or maybe you’d see someone parking on the sidewalk and not have the confidence to say anything. Don’t worry. Within seconds they’d be completely surrounded by mimes, all pointing and shaking their heads dramatically. And in that moment, a buoyed public would join in too.

Lord Winston could have done with Mockus that day last week. Noise polluters in Bogotá would often find themselves at the center of a large group of people all dressed up as Benedictine monks, each of them holding one finger to their lips to point out how loud they were being.

Surreality aside, what Antanas Mockus did was playfully and powerfully ensure people felt accountable for their actions. He held that looking glass aloft.

We can’t all afford an army of mimes. But we can afford to say something.

Because we can choose to be civilized, and we can choose to be civil.

We can say “Just stop.”

It's grilled on the same broiler used for beef and chicken. ,https://www.today.com/food/new-burger-king-impossible-whopper-isn-t-vegetarian-t160203,"Burger King made headlines last August with the debut of its Impossible Whopper, a burger made with a plant-based, protein-filled patty. This week, the chain unveiled the next iteration of its Impossible offerings with a new breakfast sandwich: the Impossible Croissan’wich.

When Burger King's original Impossible Whopper hit stores nationwide, many were upset that even though the veggie burger isn't made with any meat (or animal byproducts), the burger itself isn't 100% vegetarian when ordered with no modifications.

The Impossible Whopper uses a plant-protein based burger patty from food technology company Impossible. It's made with soy protein, potato protein, coconut oil, sunflower oil, salt, yeast and a variety of emulsifying agents. Getty Images stock

Last summer, Burger King made it clear that the only way in which its new Whopper was different from the traditional one was the Impossible patty. Since vegans traditionally avoid eggs, the Impossible Whopper was quickly dismissed as a legitimate vegan fast-food alternative since the burger is topped with mayonnaise.

However, many vegetarians consume animals products like cheese and dairy, so a little mayo was deemed OK. However, unless you ask for the Impossible Whopper in a specific way, it might not meet one's definition of true vegetarian fare.

While the burger itself contains no meat, Burger King acknowledged that the Impossible patties are flame-grilled on the same broiler as its chicken and beef products. This means the meatless burger will likely come into contact with bits of meat and poultry as it cooks.

a big deal just became a bigger deal. the Impossible Whopper is available nationwide starting 8/8. pic.twitter.com/TpFQenSLFQ — Burger King (@BurgerKing) August 1, 2019

Many people were less than thrilled that the chain's highly publicized sandwich wasn't really living up to its hype as a great option for vegetarians.

@BurgerKing Cooking your ""Impossible Whopper"", which is SUPPOSED TO BE VEGAN on the SAME cook surface makes you a #FRAUD. No #Vegan or #Vegetarian should eat your #taintedWhoppers #PHOOEY ! — Bill Somrak (@mr_cooncat) August 6, 2019

Misleading, big fail from @BurgerKing for the new Impossible Whopper. "", 0% Beef. *Flame-grilled in the same broiler used for beef and chicken""

...So not 0% beef then. Won't touch this crap until you change this policy. @VegTimes @vegsoc @vegan @TheVeganSociety @VLmagazine — Mike Ewer 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇮🇪 (@mikeewer) August 1, 2019

However, with the release of the new breakfast sandwich (which includes a vegetarian sausage patty), many are applauding the chain for taking a step in what they see as the right direction by expanding the menu.

Okay okay - @BurgerKing - so i could eat breakfast all day. everyday.

but the impossible breakfast sausage makes it impossible to want anything else. It’s not vegan. But it is vegetarian and delicious. #impossiblebreakfast #impossiblesausage pic.twitter.com/MzvC7vJIIH — HK (@hikrut) June 16, 2020

Wow! Burger King has Impossible Breakfast Croissants Sandwiches! YAY — SpicySoozin (@spicysoozin) June 16, 2020

While Burger King may not be targeting strict vegans and vegetarians with its relatively new Impossible offerings, there are still plenty of people opting to get more of their protein from sources beyond meat for ethical and sustainable reasons.

I think I’m in for this. Not remotely a vegetarian & love the original Whopper - but I’ve tried and enjoyed the Impossible Burger before and I’ll be interested to see how it cooks up big scale under a Burger King’s flame-broiled process. https://t.co/3pmQVCRMgC — Guy McLimore (@couchguy) August 2, 2019

I've had an impossible burger and honestly it's not that bad. It was not a Whopper one, but just a burger. I'm not a vegan, vegetarian, or gluten free. Just wanted to try it, and I actually found it quite tasty. Not like a burger-burger, but I would eat it again willingly. — Andrew Jesse (@MilBadger) August 2, 2019

The move to trial meatless options mirrors other fast-food restaurants, too. Chick-fil-A said that it's looking to add more meatless items to its menu, and McDonald's has tested both a vegan burger and vegan McNuggets in Europe.

But is a veggie burger really a healthier meal?

The Impossible Whopper has roughly the same number of calories as a traditional Whopper (they both have similar amounts of fat and protein, as well). But the Impossible Whopper has 9 more grams of carbs; it also has more sodium than its meatier counterpart.

Vegans and vegetarians, if you're ready for that long-awaited STROKE, enjoy the ""Impossible Whopper."" It has no meat and a mere 1080 mg. of sodium.🤣 pic.twitter.com/ghLeNxw1Qh — HaveToTakeATrump (@HaveToTakeATru2) August 1, 2019

Bonnie Taub-Dix, a registered dietician, creator of BetterThanDieting.com and author of ""Read It Before You Eat It:Taking You From Label to Table,"" told TODAY Food that the Impossible items being sold by Burger King definitely do not fall into the ""health food category"" due to the number of calories and amount of saturated fat it contains.

""Having the occasional plant-based burger is fine for anyone, but don’t kid yourself into thinking that it’s any better for you than a meat-based burger,"" Taub-Dix said. ""If you’re looking to save calories and fat, though, perhaps go for a burger smaller than a Whopper, and don’t order your plant-based burger with extra cheese.""

However, there are plenty of plant-based patties (they might not necessarily look or taste like beef) on the market that are a great way to enjoy veggies and get some protein. Many of these items are available in the freezer aisle at your local health food store. Always look at the product's label and examine its macro nutrients, as well as sodium and saturated fat content, Taub-Dix advised.

Back in August, the TODAY anchors gave the Impossible Whopper a thumbs up (Sheinelle Jones even called it ""delightful!).

Jessica Applegren, vice president of communications at Impossible Foods, told TODAY that company sales surged 2019. According to Applegren, some restaurants that carried Impossible products, like Red Robin, ran out of the plant-based patty soon after they started offering it.

Vegetarian burger fans weren't happy then, either.

I'm so sorry for the confusion. Impossible has had a supply shortage, but all of our restaurants should be serving Impossible burgers again. — Red Robin (@redrobinburgers) August 5, 2019

getting real tired of the impossible burger shortage — Trevor 🏳️‍🌈☀️ (@trevleft) August 1, 2019

Shortage issues aside, Impossible products are currently on the menu at about 10,000 restaurants worldwide.

""Growth has come from every sales category in which the company does business. Independent restaurants, large restaurant chains, such as White Castle, Cheesecake Factory and Qdoba, and non-commercial outlets such as theme parks, museums, stadiums and college campuses,"" Applegren said.

Late last summer, Impossible Foods also received the approval to sell its products in grocery stores. Various Impossible products (including its signature burger patty) are now available at food retailers in 37 states.

For vegetarians who want to stick to a strict meat-free regimen, a spokesperson for Burger King confirmed to TODAY that guests ordering the Impossible burger must ask for the patty to be cooked in the oven, instead of being grilled alongside other meat items, when ordering their meal.",Why Burger King's Impossible Whopper isn’t totally vegetarian

No. ,https://www.ladbible.com/community/interesting-youtuber-tests-if-sharks-can-actually-smell-a-drop-of-blood-20190806,"It's a classic Hollywood trope that's been used in countless films and TV shows where someone will be in the ocean and suddenly they get attacked by a shark because there's a drop of blood.

But how accurate is this?

A YouTuber set out to answer this question and the answer has been pretty surprising.

Advert 10

Mark Rober didn't just chuck himself in a tank with a docile shark that's been studied for years, he decided put himself in the middle of the ocean in the Bahamas where there were sharks galore.

They first set up a test to see whether sharks liked the scent of blood over other flavours. They grabbed four surfboards and placed fish oil, cow's blood, seawater, and urine on top of them to see what attracted what.

While the cow's blood didn't attract much to begin with, there were more than 40 by the end of the study.

There was a mild reaction to the fish oil and the urine and seawater attracted nothing.

Advert 10

Credit: Mark Rober

So then it was onto the next test, which was to see whether sharks had a particular affinity for human blood. Again, there were control surfboards employed for the study, one that deployed one drop of blood per minute, one that would espouse one drop every four seconds and one that had nothing.

Interestingly, researchers found that no sharks were attracted to any of the surfboards.

""I think it's safe to qualitatively say that if no sharks came to check out 15 drops of human blood a minute in the middle of shark-infested waters, you're probably going to be okay with a small scrape,"" Rober revealed.

Advert 10

""There certainly won't be some kind of feeding frenzy with a single drop of blood from all sharks within a mile.""

That should certainly help loads of people relax about going into the ocean with a small scratch because, let's be honest, we've all thought about it at one point or another.

Advert 10

But that's not to say that sharks aren't ferocious predators.

That's what a group of blokes discovered as they were on a fishing trip in America.

The men were fishing about 30 miles off the coast of Manasquan Inlet, New Jersey, when they were paid a visit by a massive shark, more than half the size of their boat.

Advert 10

In a video taken from the boat, the grey figure can be seen lurking ominously below the water, edging closer and closer.

As the calm among the fishermen rapidly evaporates, the shark then surges above the water and rips the bait from the vessel, Jaws-style.",YouTuber Tests If Sharks Can Actually Smell A Drop Of Blood From A Mile Away

Jeremy Clarkson , 56, opened up about a frightening moment where he “figured” he had bowel cancer. The Grand Tour host revealed he “nearly had a heart attack” when he spotted a red stain around the toilet bowl after going to the bathroom. Recalling the shocking moment in his column for The Sun, Jeremy explained: ""I looked back to see what I'd produced and damn near had a heart attack."" Describing the scene, he said the ""whole bowl was stained blood red”.

The former Top Gear star then admitted he jumped to the conclusion that he had bowel cancer.

Jeremy recalled his thought process at the time, adding: ""Well that's it, I've got bottom cancer.""

Much to the presenter’s relief, he suddenly remembered he tucked into some beetroot the night before.

Joking about his realisation, Jeremy continued in reference to the vegetable: “I swear to God that stuff should come with a health warning, advising people that it will make your number twos the colour of Marilyn Monroe’s lips.”

The outspoken TV personality went on to explain how the cancer scare made him worry about leaving his three children, Emily, 25, Finlo, 21, and 23-year-old Katya.

Michelle Obama Just Gave Meghan Markle Advice on Being a New Mom — and It Left Her 'Speechless'

When it comes to motherhood, former First Lady Michelle Obama has one piece of advice for Meghan Markle: “Savour it all.”

Meghan, who welcomed son Archie Harrison in May, said she was left “somewhat speechless” when the questions she sent Obama to answer for the back page of British Vogue‘s September issue (which Meghan guest-edited!) were returned “as a thoughtful, reflective and beautifully curated narrative – a gentle reminder not of how but of why she has become such a globally respected public figure.”

Meghan revealed that the two women discussed the project “over a casual lunch of chicken tacos and my ever-burgeoning bump.” And the final result includes a lot of compelling parenting advice for the new royal mom.

“Being a mother has been a masterclass in letting go,” Obama wrote in response to Meghan’s question about what motherhood has taught her. “Try as we might, there’s only so much we can control. And, boy, have I tried — especially at first. As mothers, we just don’t want anything or anyone to hurt our babies. But life has other plans. Bruised knees, bumpy roads and broken hearts are part of the deal.”

The former first lady goes on to explain the differences in her two daughters, 21-year-old Malia and 18-year-old Sasha.

“Motherhood has taught me that, most of the time, my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be. Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age, but who they are, deep inside,” she said. “Motherhood has also taught me that my job is not to bulldoze a path for them in an effort to eliminate all possible adversity. But instead, I need to be a safe and consistent place for them to land when they inevitably fail; and to show them, again and again, how to get up on their own.”

Obama also reflected on what it was like to be a parent to infants, the phase that Meghan and Prince Harry find themselves in now with their nearly 3-month-old son.

“When Malia and Sasha were newborns, Barack and I could lose hours just watching them sleep. We loved to listen to the little sounds they’d make — especially the way they cooed when they were deep into dreaming,” she said. “Don’t get me wrong, early parenthood is exhausting. I’m sure you know a thing or two about that these days. But there is something so magical about having a baby in the house. Time expands and contracts; each moment holds its own little eternity.”

Obama continued, “I’m so excited for you and Harry to experience that, Meghan. Savour it all.”

Meghan, 37, was a hands-on collaborator for the edition, from selecting the cover stars and interviews to choosing the photographer.

Editor-in-chief Edward Enninful revealed that he and Meghan both chose famed photographer Peter Lindbergh as the artist behind the camera for the cover shoot.

The rock, dubbed Asteroid 2019 OK, passed within 43,500 miles of Earth traveling at a speed of 15 miles a second, the Sydney Morning Herald first reported.

“This is one of the closest approaches to Earth by an asteroid that we know of. And it’s a pretty large one,” Michael Brown, an associate professor at Monash University’s school of physics and astronomy told the paper.

They're highly visible. ,https://www.rd.com/article/why-school-buses-are-always-yellow/,"Admit it, you've always wondered!

Back in April 1939 and armed with a $5,000 grant supplied by the Rockefeller Foundation, Columbia University Teachers College professor Frank Cyr took a tour of ten states to gauge the extent of school transportation issues. What he found proved that student transportation was in a sorry state—many students had no dependable way to get to school and the ones who did often traveled in unsafe, unstandardized buses in the over 100,000 school districts that existed back then (in contrast to the roughly 13,000 that exist today). One of the huge variations in school transportation that he saw? Bus color, which leads us to ask, why are school buses yellow now?

How did school buses become yellow?

Seeing a need to fix this system, Cyr organized a conference—one that would change the future of school buses forever. School officials and transportation specialists convened to set much-needed standards for buses, including those for color, height, and width as well as safety rules that hadn’t previously been set or that varied by state. Another thing that also went through a much-needed standardization? Stop signs—they used to be yellow, and much more recently than you think.

Why are school buses yellow?

There were many different bus colors in the United States before this conference; several districts even planned to have red, white, and blue buses as a way of promoting patriotism among students. Cyr presented his new options to education officials, a reported “50 shades ranging from lemon yellow to deep orange-red.” The matter was settled quickly. Yellow, or “National School Bus Glossy Yellow,” as it is officially called by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, was chosen for its high visibility and the way it emphasized the bold, black writing that would be on the side of each bus to denote its respective school district. This yellow color is an important factor for vehicles that travel during early morning and late afternoon hours. Color has always been important to our daily routine—check out the reason our traffic lights are red, yellow, and green. Thirty-five states made the changes promptly, and every state was on board by 1974.

Gone With The Wind - when adjusted for inflation. ,https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a28503634/avengers-endgame-isnt-biggest-blockbuster-ever-gone-with-the-wind/,"Avengers: Endgame became the highest-grossing movie of all time this week, dethroning Avatar after 10 years on the top spot.

However, hold your horses, as it turns out Marvel's flick isn't really the biggest blockbuster in history – at least, if you take inflation into account.

The honour instead goes to 1939 classic Gone with the Wind, which adjusted for inflation would have taken $3.44 billion at today's ticket prices, well ahead of Endgame's $2.79 billion, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.

MGM

In fact, Avengers: Endgame is the 16th biggest movie of all time when ticket price inflation is taken into account, behind the likes of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, ET: The Extra-Terrestrial and Avatar (via Box Office Mojo).

Still, at least Endgame is more fitting with the times, especially as Gone with the Wind hasn't exactly dated well – notably in terms of its portrayal of race relations.

Following on from the Marvel flick's big box office record, Avatar director James Cameron congratulated the movie on its success, saying in a statement: ""I see you, Marvel. Congratulations to Avengers Endgame on becoming the new box-office king. Jim Cameron.""

From Toys R Us closing down to Donald Trump becoming president, it’s no secret The Simpsons has been at the forefront of a lot of important decision making.

Okay so maybe the sitcom didn’t actually have a hand in these scenarios being brought to life outside of our TV screens, but it has manage to predict them in sometimes spookily accurate ways.

Advert 10

Now, the show’s writers have revealed exactly how they manage to ‘predict the future’, and it’s much less conspiratorial than you might think.

Twentieth Century Fox

In an interview with Radio 1 Newsbeat, writer Stephanie Gillis explained how they are constantly looking to the future in that they have to try and ‘guess’ what will happen in the world months in advance.

Stephanie said:

Advert 10

We are sort of futurologists in that we write 10 months ahead, so we’re trying to guess what is going to happen.

Because of this, it’s more than likely they are going to hit the jackpot and make correct predictions at least some of the time – especially when they consult things that have already happened to inform their decisions.

Take, for example, the Donald Trump prediction: another of the show’s writers, Al Jean, explained how they were ‘looking for a funny celebrity who would be president’ way back when in 2000 – and Trump had already said he’d consider running for office in the future.

The writer, who has been with Homer and the crew since the show began in 1989, went on to say:

If you make enough predictions then 10 per cent will turn out to be right.

Jean also explained how an episode which aired long before the September 11, 2001 terror attacks – which provided a field day for conspiracy theorists when it appeared to predict 9/11 – was simply a massive coincidence.

In the episode, the family head to New York City and buy a guide book which has the words ‘9 dollars’ on it next to a picture of the Twin Towers and ultimately looked like 9/11. However, Jean said that was ‘totally coincidental’.

The predictions don’t stop there though; the show has also been known to predict Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl performance, the Game Of Thrones Battle Of King’s Landing, Disney’s takeover of Fox, and Canada’s legalisation of marijuana – to name just a few.

I tell you what, as impressive as getting a gig on The Simpsons is, those writers should be adding ‘fortune teller’ and/or ‘predictor of the future’ to the top of their CVs.

Nothing. ,https://www.ncconsumer.org/news-articles-eg/what-really-happens-if-you-dont-go-into-airplane-mode-while-flying.html,"What Really Happens With the Plane if You Don't Set Your Phone to Airplane Mode When Flying? There are really good reasons for keeping your phone on airplane mode, but they are probably not what you think

April 17, 2021

What happens if you don't put your cell phone into airplane mode when flying? Most people obey the order to disconnect. Others do not, yet the plane still lands safely. You may have even been guilty of turning off cellular data mistakenly believing that you're in airplane mode. But if planes aren't crashing because of phones, why should you put your phone into airplane mode during your next flight?

Does a Cell Phone Interfere with a plane's navigation?

Some people believe that a cell phone interferes with the equipment on a plane primarily responsible for navigation. But it's never been proven that this is the case. Systems on aircraft are crafted to some pretty high standards and are shielded to prevent outside interference. Still, just because a phone hasn't been responsible for causing interference doesn't mean it's not possible.

The National Transportation Safety Board has never issued a recommendation about personal electronic devices on planes. In fact, there is no documented case in which electromagnetic interference from a portable electronic device contributed to a plane crash. Electromagnetic interference risks are very low, but the consequences are quite high.

Will The Plane Crash?

Your phone is not necessarily going to cause the plane to crash. But you will annoy the pilots and air traffic controllers. And that annoyance could be enough to distract them. On the ground, cell phones operate at a fairly low power. However, as you get further from a cell phone tower, the power of your phone must increase in order to communicate effectively. This power can be magnitudes higher than a simple WiFi or Bluetooth signal. As you get higher from the ground, you get higher from the cell phone towers. So, your phone increases power accordingly.

Unpleasant Noise

This increase in power causes radio emissions that can make a very unpleasant noise through the audio system that the pilots and air traffic controllers can hear. Obviously, if there is just one person on the plane inconsiderate enough to leave a cell phone turned on, it's probably not enough to cause too much of a disturbance. However, the more people who have cell phones transmitting signals the more feedback noise and distraction is present for the pilots. That distraction could be enough to cause a problem in flight. You really don't want your pilot distracted.

What About Carriers that Allow In-Flight Calls?

Some carriers have in-flight cellular service. In this case, there is a cell station inside the plane that communicates directly to the ground. Cell phones on board communicate directly with the cell station at a very low power, causing no issues. So, if you accidentally forget to turn your phone into airplane mode, it's not that big of a deal. But you should follow this simple order, as you are helping those professionals on your plane to get you where you need to go as safely as possible.

What is the take home message?

Even though a cell phone signal probably won't directly cause a plane crash, you should still do your part. So do everyone a favor; just put your phone to airplane mode and turn off anything you don't need to have on. Your pilots, who are responsible for getting you to your destination safely, will thank you.",What Really Happens With the Plane if You Don't Set Your Phone to Airplane Mode When Flying?
Orcas. ,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/white-sharks-are-terrified-of-killer-whales-study-says/,"Great white sharks are all bark and, well, maybe a little less bite than previously believed – at least when it comes to the ocean’s mafia.

According to new research published in Scientific Reports, white sharks off the coast of Northern California high-tail it whenever orcas show up. Even better? They’ve been documented avoiding that area for up to a year later.

""These are huge white sharks. Some are over 18 feet long (5.5 meters), and they usually rule the roost here,"" said scientist Scot Anderson in a statement, adding that his team has been observing some of these sharks for the last two decades.

Every September and December, white sharks migrate to the Farallon Islands to hunt young elephant seals for over a month at a time. Orcas, who also feed off the seals, only occasionally join the party. But as soon as they show up, white sharks leave the area within just a few minutes.

""When confronted by orcas, white sharks will immediately vacate their preferred hunting ground and will not return for up to a year, even though the orcas are only passing through,"" said Dr Salvador Jorgensen, a senior research scientist at Monterey Bay Aquarium and lead author of the study.

The findings challenge the idea that white sharks are the most voracious predators in the ocean, and shows us that even the giant hunters can become the hunted. When such events happen, the entire food web is impacted. In this case, elephant seal populations experience four to seven times fewer predation events when the sharks are gone.

Researchers analyzed four encounters between white sharks and orcas in the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of San Francisco, California. They also looked at data from 165 tagged white sharks between 2006 and 2013 and compared their migration patterns against field observations of orca sightings in the area compiled over 27 years. They found that even brief visits from killer whales made white sharks leave the area, disrupting their feeding patterns for an extended period of time. The sharks preferred to crowd together at other elephant seal colonies farther along the coast or head offshore rather than stay in the vicinity of orcas.

Interactions between apex such as these are important, albeit not well-documented.

""We don't typically think about how fear and risk aversion might play a role in shaping where large predators hunt and how that influences ocean ecosystems,"" Jorgensen said. ""It turns out these risk effects are very strong even for large predators like white sharks – strong enough to redirect their hunting activity to less preferred but safer areas.""

Researchers say they aren’t sure if the orcas are targeting white sharks as prey (they’ve been known to do as much) or if they’re simply bullying competition to get after their preferred meal choice. Regardless, it adds insight into how feeding behaviors influence marine ecosystems.

""I think this demonstrates how food chains are not always linear,"" Jorgensen said. ""So-called lateral interactions between top predators are fairly well known on land but are much harder to document in the ocean. And because this one happens so infrequently; it may take us a while longer to fully understand the dynamics.""",Study Reveals What Great White Sharks Are Afraid Of

Consumer Protect recently analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to determine the most unhealthy states in the US.

According to the organization, West Virginia — followed closely by Mississippi and Oklahoma — is the most obese in the US, with roughly 38 percent of adults in the state struggling with obesity as of 2017.

By contrast, Colorado was determined by Consumer Protect to be the least obese state in the nation, with roughly 22.6 percent of adults in the state being obese as of the same year.

America has long dealt with the issue of obesity. The condition affected 93.3 million adults in the country from 2015 to 2016, per the CDC.

“In 1990, obese adults made up less than 15 percent of the population in most US states. By 2010, 36 states had obesity rates of 25 percent or higher, and 12 of those had obesity rates of 30 percent or higher,” according to Harvard University’s School of Public Health.

“While US obesity rates have, overall, stayed steady since 2003, the rates are still rising in some groups, and disparities persist: Non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and Mexican American adults have higher rates of obesity than non-Hispanic white adults,” the school added.

Mississippi (37.3 percent) and Oklahoma (36.5 percent) claimed the No. 2 and No. 3 spots on Consumer Protect’s list in terms of percentage of obese adults in the area.

Consumer Protect also looked at states where adults engaged “in zero physical leisure activity,” which they dubbed the “Couch Potato Index.”

Kentucky was No. 1, with 34.4 percent of adults in the state engaging in zero physical activity. Mississippi and Arkansas followed behind with 33.2 percent and 32.5 percent, respectively.

There are many obesity-related health conditions, namely heart disease, type 2 diabetes, some types of cancer and stroke, among other health ailments, according to the CDC.

Here’s a look at the 10 most obese states in the US and the percentage of obese adults living in that location, per Consumer Protect.

You'll likely need more money than you think. By 50, you should aim to have at least six times your salary saved for retirement in order to be on track to retire at 67, according to calculations from retirement-plan provider Fidelity.

If you earn $50,000 a year, you shoud aim to have $300,000 put away by 50. If your current salary is $100,000, you should aim for $600,000 in retirement savings.

But how much do Americans actually have saved? As of the fourth quarter of 2020, Americans between the ages of 50 and 59 have an average 401(k) balance of $203,600, according to data from Fidelity's retirement platform. Employees in this age group contribute an average rate of 10.4% of their salaries.

Taking advantage of an employer match is an easy way to boost savings. The average employer contribution for 50-year-old Americans is 4.8%. By contributing just over 10% of your salary, you would be adding a total of 15% of your salary to your 401(k) each year.

Saving money for retirement can be hard, especially if you are behind or cannot save much.

Who are we? ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/17/three-word-question-world-biggest-brains-survey-intellectuals,"What is preoccupying the world’s leading minds? It is an audacious question for sure. Some might say leading physicists will be concentrating on physics, leading philosophers on philosophy, historians on history and so on.

And yet when we look back on different eras, we can sometimes spot a thread – the preoccupation with truth in ancient Athens, with beauty in Renaissance Europe, with political “reason” during the Enlightenment, with scientific progress during the industrial age. There is, I believe, likewise a new preoccupation lurking in the biggest brains of our time, and that theme is summed up in one word – identity.

What possible basis could I have for making what may, I realise, sound like a wild claim? Well, in a know-nothing political age Prospect, the magazine I edit, felt it would be timely to salute intellectual effort by this week publishing a list of 50 top thinkers. They have been picked on the basis of fruitfully engaging with the problems of our times, giving weight to originality, impact and communication. We have consulted closely with global authorities on economics, history and science about their peers, and considered the books and ideas we can see making waves. The biggest of these waves – by far – are those concerning identity.

That’s not the only change since the magazine produced its first global hit parade in 2005. Some differences are stark. For example, whereas in 2005 there were 90 men and just 10 women, today the gender mix is essentially 50-50. And certain subjects have gained prominence exactly as you’d expect: climate science and especially tech.

There are other changes, too, that you’d expect. In economics, the brightest minds are asking newly disruptive questions. Dani Rodrik is included for his erudite exploration of why the promise of globalisation has disappointed so many, as well as Anne Case and Angus Deaton for elucidating the human toll of American capitalism. Economic historian Adam Tooze features for exposing the limitations of nation-based macroeconomics, as does Hyun-Song Shin of the Bank for International Settlements for starting to sketch the alternative of a border-straddling macro-financial perspective.

All interesting stuff, but a natural response to the crash. The bit I didn’t see coming is how many big minds would be consumed by variants of a single question: who are we? By my reckoning it is around half. What exactly, disparate thinkers are asking, does it mean to be American, Muslim, Indian, female, black or simply human?

Starting with that last and most general question of identity, primatologist Frans de Waal has lit up the human condition by living with apes, and the fast-rising philosophical star Amia Srinivasan has written brilliantly on octupuses and termites, noting how often people have looked at insects and “seen themselves”. There’s room, too, for geneticist Robert Plomin, who believes modern science has done for the idea of the blank slate, but refuses to lapse into genetic determinism, and instead focuses on how society can even out the odds for people with different DNA.

As it happens, the first three names on the list – and they are just alphabetical for now, with a public vote to pick the top 10 open – are all wrestling with identity. Naomi Alderman’s novel Disobedience, about a London rabbi’s bisexual daughter, explores how faith communities can find space for difference; Syrian architect Marwa al-Sabouni explains how deadly walls of misunderstanding in Syria grew up due to a dearth of public spaces; philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah reconciles the importance of grounded identities with the need to protect vulnerable groups.

That last need is made all the more pressing by the cheerleader for racism in the White House. A rare journalist on the list is Ta-Nehisi Coates, in the summer the argument of his influential Atlantic essay The Case for Reparations finally reached Congress. Ghanaian-born, US-based novelist Yaa Gyasi is here for Homecoming, which makes sense of modern America by tracing its story forward from the nation’s original sin of slavery. Back in Europe, Cas Mudde makes the grade as the pre-eminent scholar of the identity-based populist backlash. Closer to home, David Olusoga features because of writing and broadcasting that forces Britain to rethink a troubling imperial past.

Religious, racial and national identities have come to the forefront of thinking during war or dictatorships

Coming from a very different perspective is JD Vance, a conservative venture capitalist from the wrong side of the tracks. His memoir Hillbilly Elegy sympathetically locates the roots of the rage of the US’s white working class to grim conditions like those he grew up in. Then there is social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, who riles leftwing campus activists by pointing to evidence about how feelings can lead you astray, and urges them to clamber out of deep culture-war trenches.

The work of many of our other top thinkers – critic Sarah Churchwell, psychoanalytic scholar Jacqueline Rose, novelist Arundhati Roy and philosopher Kate Manne – all engage with gender or national identities. The precedents are not happy: religious, racial and national identities have come to the forefront of thinking during war, strife or dictatorships. Until recently, they wouldn’t have loomed so large on any plausible list of top thinkers drawn up in the west.

It may be tempting to imagine their prominence is due to multiculturalism. But the dates don’t work. Western societies have been growing more diverse for generations, and the sharpened sense of difference has been there since 9/11 at least. What has changed more recently is rampant insecurity, a product of tough economic times and the decline of western nations used to being top dogs. Some are left hankering to take back control, or make their country great again. But in the face of nostalgic chauvinism, the lot of the biggest minds seems to be to turn inwards – and wonder who they really are.",Revealed: the three-word question consuming the world’s biggest brains | Tom Clark
Baby foxes. ,https://www.insideedition.com/firefighters-rescue-puppies-gutter-only-find-they-were-actually-foxes-41664,"Colorado firefighters had no idea what they were getting themselves into when they rescued several baby foxes from a storm drain.

A fireman from the Colorado Springs Fire Department was caught on camera pulling out at least eight black-colored pups from a storm drain last Thursday.

Officials at the scene assumed they were newborn black Labrador puppies during the rescue, causing officials to be concerned that it was a case of dog dumping, Fire Captain Brian Vaughan told InsideEdition.com.

Vaughn said the rescue took about 20 minutes, and the litter was relinquished to the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region shortly after.

That’s when they discovered the ""puppies"" were actually baby red foxes.

“They took them [to the shelter] and actually one of the vets in that location said, 'No, these aren’t Labradors, these are foxes,” Vaughn said. “[The firefighter] was just in shock.”

He explained their neighborhood is in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, and foxes are commonplace in the area.

The baby foxes are still being cared for at the Humane Society, and it is unclear what will happen to them when they have been rehabilitated.

When they stop making money. ,https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476383/disney-wont-stop-making-live-action-remakes-until-it-stops-making-money,"Another Disney live-action remake is headed to theaters with July's The Lion King, and as many are well aware, there are more live-action projects on the way. ""Why?"" some on the internet may ask. So, why do more remakes of Disney classics keep coming down the pipeline? It seems like a valid question, especially when polarizing castings or various other changes that appear in these remakes tend to stir up all sorts of concerns or even arguing amongst Disney fans.

It's a question that has marked this decade in particular, and has slowly intensified with each passing year following Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland remake in 2010. Believe it or not, though, there's a reason Disney continues to push these live-action remakes through: the movies make money. Until these remakes stop making money, we are going to continue to see live-action remakes of all the animated Disney classics get produced. Let's take a look at what got us here, how much The Lion King could make and what the future of the live-action projects holds.

Just How Much Money Do These Live-Action Remakes Make?

Since 2010, there have actually been nine live-action Disney movies that were remakes or adaptations of animated classics. While critics may have been middling on most of them, they were all solid commercial successes. In fact, two of them (Alice In Wonderland and Beauty And The Beast) have grossed over a billion dollars. Jon Favreau's previous live-action flick The Jungle Book wasn't far off from that, either, bringing in $966.6 million, and Aladdin is doing pretty well at around $960 million at the time of this writing.

Even the lesser performing live-action Disney adaptations have pulled a respectable profit. Christopher Robin was the lowest with $122.7 million difference between projected budget and box office numbers, but it's worth noting its budget was a quarter of most of the other live-action adaptations of this era -- and it wasn't a straight adaptation, either, like some of the more beloved properties. This may be why it didn't measure up numbers-wise to a majority of the cookie-cutter adaptations like Beauty and the Beast.

Put all of the estimated budgets of these nine films (around $1,118,000,000?) up against the box office pull ($6,366,600,461), and Disney has come out way ahead on these sorts of animated-but-realistic projects. Audiences may say they want something original, but time and time again Disney has put these projects out and they've flopped: think John Carter and particularly Tomorrowland. When looking at the numbers, it isn't hard to see why Disney feels no guilt in giving an audience remakes that look pretty but aren't strictly necessary.

What Happens If The Lion King Flops, Will Live-Action End?

First off, let's just be realistic and say there's a very good chance that The Lion King will not flop. The fact that people are wondering if it will still hit a billion dollars with poor reviews should be evidence enough that this one will be a commercial success even if it ends up sticking with a Rotten score.

With all that in mind, let's say there's a hypothetical boycott in which the entire world (because international box office numbers for these films often nearly double the American box office) boycotts The Lion King and it flops. Sure, Disney might be rattled that people of many nations and backgrounds united on this one issue, but it still has many remakes, sequels and adaptations in the pipeline that ensure this trend keeps on rolling.

That's not to say a few flops wouldn't make Disney re-evaluate that strategy, but if we're wondering if The Lion King will hit a billion dollars despite lukewarm reviews, then I think we're all subconsciously admitting the day people stop turning up for these movies is pretty far off, which means there is certainly appetite for them. Still though, if by some miracle this movie flops, Mulan flops, and the next few that follow flop, then maybe, maybe, Disney will stop re-releasing animated classics in live action.

But Disney Will Eventually Run Out Of Animated Movies To Remake, Right?

To date, Disney has made nine live-action remakes of animated classics, and three adaptations based on the animated classics. There are several others of both types in various stages of development, and scores of many other movies in its vault to consider for future live-action adaptations. Sure, not all of them like Fantasia or The Three Caballeros will probably get made, but there are still plenty of options.

Even then, folks need to realize that any of these live-action adaptations could get another live-action adaptation down the road. The Jungle Book already had a live-action adaptation in 1994, and made more money with a version that was actually less live-action (and is getting a sequel) two decades later. Remakes of remakes are on the table, which means Disney could be going to this fountain long after we're all dead and gone. That's not even getting into all the sequel possibilities out there.

Is this really that bad of a thing though? Disney's live-action remakes may cause some controversy, angst, and destroy the childhood of some grown adults, but box office numbers show a lot of people watch them. Are we to believe the masses are going to the theaters just to hate watch a movie they wish was never made to begin with? Of course not, although one may think that looking at the outrage and comments on some of these movies. Just remember, angry people on social media are often just a minor part of a whole.

So, Disney Likely Won't Quit These Live-Action Remakes

Again, there's an unfathomable scenario where multiple Disney live-action remakes and adaptations flop and the company stops, but the numbers indicate those days are far off into the future. Until folks stop turning up for these movies, there's no chance in hell Disney will ever consider shoveling audiences slightly different but more of the same movies they've already made millions off of.

And really, who can blame Disney? Do people get upset at Vanilla Ice when he shows up to a venue and plays ""Ice Ice Baby,"" instead of a deep cut from his album? No, people want the classics and what they know, and the box office has often shown that's largely true with movies as well.

Are there exceptions? Absolutely, but take one glimpse at the box office success of originals IPs vs. sequels and remakes of established franchises, and it's clear which route studios prefer to go almost every time. it's always going to be worth the complaints from the peanut gallery, until enough disgruntled souls finally put their foot down and say ""enough is enough.""

In particular, there still seems to be enough excitement around these projects that we could be getting more for some time to come, which means the only question left to ask is whether or not the House of Mouse will be able to maintain it's current pace of putting a slew of these out each year. Which means it's up to you to get on board with the new movies, or don't.

$75 million. ,https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/avengers-endgame-robert-downey-jr-alternate-final-lines-iron-man/,"✖

After a decade of wholesome family fun, Iron Man star Robert Downey, Jr. joked (we think?) on a podcast appearance this week that Avengers: Endgame almost saw its hero drop an F-bomb for some of his last words. The notion came up as part of a little quiz, where the Hypocondriactor Podcast got him to talk a little bit about those final days as Iron Man, and reveal that the ""I am Iron Man"" not only wasn't the only line considered, but may not have been the scripted line. He attributes it rather vaguely to either one of the editors or one of the writers, which might suggest there was either a different line altogether, or a placeholder line so that it could be discussed with Downey, before they started filming.

It doesn't seem like many of the other lines had much chance of making it in -- and while the idea of dropping an F-bomb on a Mad Titan is a ton of fun, it's likely that never would have happened even if Downey were serious about it. Still, it's interesting to think of an alternate timeline where something else ended up being used in that iconic scene.

""Correct answer is 'I am Iron Man,' but I had so many alt lines that I wanted to put forward,"" Downey answered. ""Oh god, let me think. They were all super smart-ass lines like I was trying to, y'know, dumb stuff like, 'You are so f---ed' or whatever. You know what, I'll have to go back to my notes... I get the Infinity Stones and then have the power to snap and have whatever I wanna have happen--Oh, tha- I was gonna say 'Oh, snap.'""

While we joked about the F-bomb above, it doesn't quite seem like the ""snap"" pun would have landed with the same gravitas as the line he actually delivered. Downey feels the same way, and likes the symmetry of the line that eventually got used.

""[The alternate lines were] too smart-ass, and it was the whole arc of the character,"" Downey said, adding, ""it was, I think… maybe one of our great editors' ideas, or one of the writers to say we need to go right back to the first film, and have his dying words be the words of his origin….We love a bookend.""

That said, if there are dailies where he actually said any of these things, we'd love to see it.

Scene in comments. ,https://twentytwowords.com/toy-story-4-being-boycotted-because-dangerous-lesbian-scene/,"With every major movie release that comes with equal parts critical acclaim and audience love, there has to be a fly in the ointment, right? But no film has faced this more this year than Toy Story 4. The fourth part of the beloved franchise has received almost universally positive reviews online – but there always has to be someone to spoil the fun, right?

Well, as if often the case, the role of the fun police in this instance had to go to One Million Moms. The online group aren’t known for being uber-tolerant at the best of times – but they’ve taken on a strange opponent in Toy Story 4. Their complaint seems both small-minded and incendiary – and it looks like the internet agrees.

advertisement

It’s strange to think that, before 1995, we lived in a world without Toy Story. The very first Disney and Pixar collaboration came out in that year, and totally turned the world of children’s movies upside down.



advertisement

And since then, we’ve had regular check-ins from the world of the toys. Toy Story 2 followed in 1999, and Toy Story 3 in 2010.



advertisement

Many believed that Toy Story 3 would be the final film. It came out in 2010 and received as much critical acclaim as the two previous smash hit movies.



advertisement

Although it gave us this harrowing scene. Seeing all of our favorite toys almost coming to a fiery, painful end was nearly too much for audiences to bear. Although (spoiler alert) everything turned out fine in the end.



advertisement

via : Shutterstock If Toy Story 3 had ended in tragedy, it seems unlikely that there would be another follow-up. But, this year, the much anticipated fourth installment from the Toy Story universe hit our screens.



advertisement

Toy Story 4 hit theaters on June 21st. It was the first time in nine years that fans had had fresh contact with Woody, Buzz, and their other favorite characters.



advertisement

And one, in particular, truly struck a chord with fans: Forky.



advertisement

It had an almost universal appeal, because older fans of the ’90s movies and newcomers to the franchise could both enjoy the feel-good fun.



advertisement

Forky struck a chord with a lot of listless adolescents. And as a bonus? Parents can get their kids some official Toy Story 4 merch for free!



advertisement

In spite of initial doubts about the movie’s success, it did exceptionally well in the box office, making a smashing $238 million in its opening weekend.



advertisement

This week, one review, in particular, hit the headlines. It comes from well-known internet trolls, One Million Moms.



advertisement

“At the start of the movie, when Woody’s new owner Bonnie goes for her first day of kindergarten, in the background there is a quick scene where one child is dropped off by two moms. Later, the moms return to pick up their child who gives them a hug. The scene is subtle in order to to desensitize children. But it is obvious that the child has two mothers, and they are parenting together. Toy Story 4 is the last place parents would expect their children to be confronted with content regarding sexual orientation. Issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon. It is extremely common yet unnecessary.”



advertisement

And there was a high level of suspicion that the scene may not be as big a deal as One Million Moms made out.



advertisement

via : Twitter We have to say, this seems like it would be pretty easy to miss. Plus, the two women are hardly making out on screen. They could even be sisters or friends for all we know – not that it wouldn’t be totally okay if they weren’t.



advertisement

There may be an ulterior motive for the hate that One Million Moms are begetting for this scene – perhaps that these parents are clearly kind and affectionate with their kids?



advertisement

Many think that this (very small) instance of inclusion was undeniably positive and would serve as something incredibly helpful for young people concerned that they are “different.”



advertisement

The scene was so minimal that it was basically “blink and you’ll miss it” – and the fact that so many didn’t even notice the scene proves how not-a-big-deal it was.



advertisement

It does seem kind of unlikely that, had they watched the entire movie, this reviewer would be quite so irate about what amount to a couple of seconds of screentime.



advertisement

This isn’t the first instance of gay co-parenting in Disney movies by a long way – and Simba turned out absolutely fine!



advertisement

Plus, you can hardly expect Toy Story to be too strict in its normative love stories. Once you’ve had a nursery rhyme character share a kiss with an astronaut, you really do start to have to suspend your disbelief about who can and can’t love who. In fact, maybe we could all take a lesson from Toy Story. But this scene isn’t the only one Toy Story has come under (potentially unnecessary) fire for.

"""Godfather"" ",https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475944/tom-holland-admits-he-has-a-special-nickname-for-robert-downey-jr,"In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the characters of Iron Man and Spider-Man have been inseparable. The characters built a bond over the course of several films, so it's not too surprising that actors Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Holland have done the same. The pair have become close, though the fact that Iron Man is now gone from the Marvel Cinematic Universe now means that Tom Holland and Robert Downey Jr. don't get to make movies together anymore.

Spider-Man: Far From Home is the first time that the MCU Spider-Man has made a movie without his buddy Iron Man, but the two clearly still have a strong connection. It turns out Tom Holland even has the perfect nickname for his buddy Robert, as he recently admitted that Downey's phone number in his phone is labeled with more than just a name. According to Holland...

He's The Godfather in my phone. Yeah, he's like, RDJ The Godfather. Yeah, that's what I have him as.

It's a fitting nickname. In many ways, Robert Downey Jr. is the godfather. While he certainly didn't realize it back when he was making the first Iron Man movie, he was starting to build his own legacy as well as one that one expand far beyond him, with which his career will always be linked.

Now Iron Man is gone, but Robert Downey Jr. is still the Godfather. The MCU just wouldn’t be the place that is if it wasn’t for him. It’s his empire. The proof of its success is that it no longer actually needs him to survive and thrive.

It’s unclear if Robert Downey Jr. knows that Tom Holland thinks of him as “The Godfather.” If he does, he probably loves it.

While Tony Stark might not be a character in Spider-Man: Far From Home, he does cast a shadow over the film. The fact that Iron Man is gone is something that Peter Parker has to deal with, and has trouble dealing with, throughout the new film.

Tom Holland actually reveals to Marvel at the premiere of Spider-Man: Far from Home that the pair spoke the evening before, so the friendship between the two actors is clearly still strong. It had to be a little strange to be there and not see Downey. Not only have Iron Man and Spider-Man been in all of Spider-Man's previous MCU appearances, but the two characters have always performed alongside each other. Working together like that you're either going to become friends or drive each other crazy.

"Obama, during his 2nd inauguration. ",https://www.dailywire.com/news/nike-may-think-betsy-ross-flag-racist-look-who-hank-berrien,"After former San Francisco quarterback and Nike endorser Colin Kaepernick complained about an American-themed Betsy Ross flag adorning a new Nike shoe, reportedly saying he and others felt the Betsy Ross flag was an offensive symbol because of its connection to an era of slavery, Nike capitulated, pulling the shoe from production. The Wall Street Journal reported, “After images of the shoe were posted online, Mr. Kaepernick, a Nike endorser, reached out to company officials saying that he and others felt the Betsy Ross flag is an offensive symbol because of its connection to an era of slavery …”

On Wednesday, social media pointed out something to Nike that they either ignored or were unwilling to acknowledge: the famed flag, which featured 13 white stars in a circle to represent the thirteen original American colonies, was flown at former President Barack Obama’s 2nd inaugural.

In September 2016, a student waved a flag supporting Donald Trump as he joined other students waving a Betsy Ross 13-star flag at a Grand Rapids, Michigan, high school football game, chanting “USA.” That prompted one parent to claim the flag had been appropriated by white supremacy groups, adding the flag-waving “left a lot of members of my community unsettled … Your team, your coaches, your families were our guests, yet it seems many of your students are unaware of the negative impact these actions would have on members of our community in our home field,” according to MLive.

Although it has long been debated whether or not Betsy Ross actually created the “Betsy Ross flag,” the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation notes, “Congress recognized that the new nation needed a flag. On June 14, 1777, it passed the country’s first flag law. As legislation goes, it was refreshingly brief: ‘Resolved. That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.’”

105,https://www.science.org/content/article/once-you-hit-age-aging-appears-stop,"You can halt aging without punishing diets or costly drugs. You just have to wait until you're 105. The odds of dying stop rising in people who are very old, according to a new study that also suggests we haven't yet hit the limit of human longevity.

The work shows ""a very plausible pattern with very good data,"" says demographer Joop de Beer of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute in The Hague, who wasn't connected to the research. But biodemographer Leonid Gavrilov of the University of Chicago in Illinois says he has doubts about the quality of the data.

As we get older, our risk of dying soars. At age 50, for example, your risk of kicking the bucket within the next year is more than three times higher than when you're 30. As we head into our 60s and 70s, our chances of dying double about every 8 years. And if you're lucky enough to hit 100 years, your odds of making it to your next birthday are only about 60%.

But there may be a respite, according to research on lab animals such as fruit flies and nematodes. Many of these organisms show so-called mortality plateaus, in which their chances of death no longer go up after a certain age. It's been hard to show the same thing in humans, in part because of the difficulty of obtaining acccurate data on the oldest people.

So, in the new study, demographer Elisabetta Barbi of the Sapienza University of Rome and colleagues turned to a database compiled by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. It includes every person in the country who was at least 105 years old between the years 2009 and 2015—a total of 3836 people. Because Italian municipalities keep careful records on their residents, researchers at the institute could verify the individuals' ages. ""These are the cleanest data yet,"" says study co-author Kenneth Wachter, a demographer and statistician at the University of California, Berkeley.

The risk of dying leveled off in people 105 and older, the team reports online today in Science. That means a 106-year-old has the same probability of living to 107 as a 111-year-old does of living to 112. Furthermore, when the researchers broke down the data by the subjects' year of birth, they noticed that over time, more people appear to be reaching age 105.

""[That's] strong evidence that if there is a maximum limit to human lifespan, we are not close to it yet,"" Wachter says. But what that maximum is—the current longevity record is 122—remains to be seen, De Beer cautions.

The plateau may occur because frailer people gradually die off, leaving only the toughest alive. Many factors, including genes, likely account for their hardiness, and identifying these factors may suggest ways to boost survival in younger people.

Wachter says he hopes the paper will resolve the debate over whether there is a mortality plateau in humans. But Gavrilov says the authors haven't reassured him that the longevity data is as clean as they claim. For instance, he wants to know more about the people who didn't make it into the database because their reported ages couldn't be confirmed and whether excluding them affected the results. ""This paper will not settle the debate, but will ignite it further,"" he says.","Once you hit this age, aging appears to stop"

",https://www.komando.com/lifestyle/you-wont-believe-what-those-weird-black-tubes-in-the-road-are-for/449954/,"There are all kinds of unsolved mysteries in the world. The search for Bigfoot, Nessie the Loch Ness monster, aliens visiting Earth, to name a few.

We may never know the answers to those conundrums. It’s better to stick with more easily answered questions.

For example, what are those odd black tubes in the road used for? Fortunately, I can help you with this one. And no, it’s not a goofy elaborate watering system.

Have you ever wondered what those tubes are?

Have you ever been out for a drive and come across a black tube draped across the road? They’re pretty common actually, I’d be surprised if you’d never seen it.

They are actually called pneumatic road tubes. Most people think they’re used for counting cars, which they are, but they have many more functions than that.

They are used for short-term traffic counting, vehicle classification by axle count and spacing, planning, and research studies.

Some models gather data to calculate vehicle gaps, intersection stop delay, stop sign delay, saturation flow rate, spot speed as a function of vehicle class, and travel time when the counter is utilized in conjunction with a vehicle transmission sensor.

Check out the following video to see how it works:

According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, pneumatic road tube sensors send a burst of air pressure along a rubber tube when a vehicle’s tires pass over the tube. The pressure pulse closes an air switch, producing an electrical signal that is transmitted to a counter or analysis software. The pneumatic road tube sensor is portable, using lead-acid, gel, or other rechargeable batteries as a power source.

It’s a pretty cool system if you think about it. It can be set up permanently or temporary, so very flexible.

Now ya know what those crazy tubes are for. No more wondering.

They banned “personal belief” exemptions. ,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/health/california-vaccine-laws-study/index.html,"(CNN) There are now five states in the United States that do not offer personal, philosophical or religious exemptions from school vaccination requirements: California, Mississippi, West Virginia, Maine and New York.

The idea behind these controversial state laws -- which have received opposition from anti-vaccination activists -- is that requiring more children to get vaccinated, unless they have a medical reason not to, can help reduce the spread of disease.

Yet does such strict legislation really lead to more children being up-to-date on their vaccine requirements? A new study suggests yes, at least in California.

The new study involved analyzing annual data about kindergartners and their vaccination status at the start of school between 2000 and 2017. They looked at the data before and after three specific interventions took place: two vaccine-related policies and one education campaign.

The yearly rate of kindergartners without an up-to-date vaccination status rose from 7.8% in the year 2000 to 9.84% in 2013 -- before the policies and campaign -- and then the rate fell to 4.87% in 2017 -- after the policies and campaign -- according to the study published in the medical journal JAMA on Tuesday.",How California made a 'dramatic' impact on kindergartners getting vaccinated
They went up. ,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/business/mcdonalds-fresh-beef/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Fresh beef is helping McDonald's sell more burgers and gain market share.

McDonald's MCD Last year, the burger chain switched to fresh beef quarter-pound burgers from frozen at most of its stores in the contiguous United States. That change has led to a 30% spike in sales of quarter pounders on average over the past 12 months, the company said Monday. It also helpedburgers gain market share in what the industry calls the ""informal eating out"" category for the first time in five years, the company said.

McDonald's made the change to appeal to consumers' growing interest in ingredient transparency. Buyers today want to know where their food comes from, Marion Gross, the company's chief supply chain officer for North America, told CNN Business.

The fresh beef quarter-pound burgers have helped boost McDonald's sales.

McDonald's said sales of the fresh quarter-pound burger were especially strong in May 2018, when it was first introduced, thanks in part to marketing efforts. More recently, the company included the fresh beef burger in its 2 for $5 deal for the first time. The promotion performed well, CFO Kevin Ozan noted in an analyst call discussing first-quarter earnings.

A third. ,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/18/almost-a-third-of-san-francisco-office-workers-say-theyre-severely-burnt-out-more-than-national-average/,"Almost a third of San Francisco workers say they are severely burned out, according to a new study by global staffing firm Robert Half.

Twenty-nine percent of workers in the city by the bay are crispy-fried by the strains of their work life. If that sounds dire, take heart that it’s even worse in Los Angeles and Orange counties where the number of people completely charred by their working lives hits a dismal 50 percent. Crushing commutes and the brutally high cost of living in the Golden State may well be to blame. Apparently amazing views aren’t enough to make up for the stresses and strains of 24/7 productivity. Other California cities are also full of disenchanted and exhausted workers: Sacramento at 32 percent and San Diego at 31 percent.

For the record, office workers from Southern California are the nation’s most “burnt out, according to the study. The Robert Half temp agency surveyed white collar workers in 28 major metropolitan areas with a question assessing the worker’s level of burnout: from 10 for total burnout to 1 for no burnout.

Across the nation, 28 percent of workers reported being in this desperate condition. Other top offenders are: Detroit at 44 percent, then Chicago at 37 percent, Phoenix at 35 percent and New York at 34 percent.

The survey found the top concern was “career stagnation/no room for growth” cited by 29% of the survey takers. Next was “constant interruptions/fires to put out,” cited by 21% of respondents, then “unmanageable workload/long hours” (17%) and “toxic culture” (7%), as the Orange County Register noted.

The fewest burned out employees are found in Minneapolis at 15 percent, Indianapolis at 18 percent and Pittsburgh at 20 percent. It is perhaps no coincidence that these are cities with low housing costs, experts note.

Cyndi Karapogosian, a district president for Robert Half, notes that many bosses are not keeping up with an evolving workplace.

“Employers have to be critically aware of burnout in their teams,” she says, as the Orange County Register reports. “Many employers have historical thoughts on how to hire and retain workers. But the reality has definitely changed.”",You won’t believe how many San Francisco workers are burned out
"""This is a f*cking long hug."" ",https://geektyrant.com/news/daisy-ridley-reveals-what-carrie-fisher-was-whispering-in-her-ear-during-their-on-screen-hug,"Fans are getting pumped for the next and final installment in the Skywalker Saga of the Star Wars films, culminating this December with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. The most exciting part of the hype so far was when fans got to see the trailer for the first time from Star Wars Celebration in Chicago. The trailer is super cool and exciting, and it was so bittersweet to see the late Carrie Fisher’s Leia embracing Daisy Ridley’s Rey in what looked like an emotional hug. We can’t wait to see how it all unfolds, but while we wait, it’s also fun to get a little behind the scenes info from the stars.

In a recent interview with Daisy Ridley, CinemaBlend reports that Ridley was asked if she could remember what Carrie Fisher was saying to her when they shared their onscreen hug. Ridley responded:

She was actually whispering, ‘This is a fucking long hug.’ I was trying to do my acting, like, ‘Oh my god, Carrie!’ There wasn’t any discussion about what we were gonna do.

That absolutely sounds like classic Carrie Fisher! She was such a warm and hilarious lady, and I bet she was a delight to work with. I know I will be keeping that little gem in mind when I watch the movie, as this looks like it could be a pretty emotional part in the film that I may want to lighten up a bit.

Kurt Cobain. ,http://www.alternativenation.net/dave-grohl-reveals-rock-icon-strung-heroin/,"Foo Fighters frontman and former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl discussed Kurt Cobain’s heroin use and how he went to rehab, leading to a break. Dave Grohl previously discussed what it felt like to be on mushrooms.

He told Kerrang, “A lot happened after that. In the 12 months between Reading ’91 and Reading ’92 when we headlined, the band had exploded… and imploded. We went from being a three-piece band in a splitter van with a tour manager and a monitor guy, to selling millions of records, and a lot changed. It was a pretty chaotic 12 months.

Kurt got strung out and wound up having to go to rehab. I remember we finished that tour in early ’92, and we had toured America, we had toured Europe, we’d been to Australia and Japan, and we ended in Hawaii. By the time we got there we thought, ‘Okay, we need to fucking chill out, because the world has gone crazy – not just ours but everybody else’s.’ So, we took a break, and in that time Kurt had a kid, and had his ups and downs. It was chaos.

“I remember showing up to Reading ’92 and there being so many rumours that we weren’t going to play, that we had cancelled. I walked backstage and some of my best friends in bands that were opening would see me and say, ‘What are you doing here?’ And I’d go, ‘We’re fucking headlining!’ And they’d be like, ‘You’re actually going to play?!’ I didn’t realise there was any question that we were going to play. I knew within myself I was questioning if we could play, but I knew we were going to try.

“The show was a really reassuring, genuinely magical moment of everything coming together at the right time.”

Dave Grohl also discussed drugs in a SMH interview.

“Music is my life, it’s all I’ve known and I don’t see a reason to stop because I actually wake up and wanna do it. My music makes me want to live and that’s a beautiful thing,” he says.

Grohl formed the Foo Fighters in Seattle in 1994 – the same year he lost his bandmate and front man of Nirvana, Kurt Cobain. He triumphed over tragedy at a time when he felt it was impossible.

“It’s been one hell of a ride ever since,” says Grohl of the music journey he’s been on over the past few decades.

A few years off turning 50, the guitarist and drummer says he wouldn’t have survived the business as long as he did if he had kept up his early behaviour.

“One thing I did before Nirvana became popular was I stopped doing drugs,” he says. “By the time I was 20, I just stopped doing that stuff because it didn’t make me feel emotionally, mentally or physically healthy. I have a drink every now and again, sure, but if you want to weather a career like I’ve done, you can’t do this shit half-assed. It’s challenging and you have to try and keep your head – there’s a lot going on around you all the time and with time you get better at keeping on top of it all.”",Dave Grohl Reveals Rock Icon Was ‘Strung Out’ On Heroin
Baggage fees. ,https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/american-delta-united-made-757-million-selling-this-1-simple-thing-only-problem-passengers-hate-it.html,"Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly -- and U.S. airlines gotta squeeze every nickel and dime that they can out of their passengers, by and large.

Specifically, the ranking we're talking about involves baggage fees. During just the first three months of the year, the government says American, United, and Delta took in more than $757 million charging passengers who want to bring their luggage with them.

That's part of a $1.3 billion haul across the entire industry, which represents a 18 percent bump over a year ago. It's all thanks largely to the fact that, like a group of inflationary dominoes, almost all of the airlines raised baggage fees by about 20 percent during the final months of 2018. Here's the full list:

American Airlines $317.3 million

United Airlines $238.5 million

Delta Air Lines $201.4 million

Spirit Airlines $176,1 million

Frontier Airlines $91.4 million

JetBlue $84.6 million

Alaska Airlines $69.7 million

Allegiant $63.7 million

Hawaiian $20.2 million

Sun Country $16.7 million

Southwest Airlines $12.0 million

So, what to make of this, besides perhaps to envy that the airlines have mostly managed to take something that we all understood would be included in ticket prices just a few years back -- and turned it into a multibillion dollar annual revenue stream?

At least two things: Southwest Airlines and the U.S. Congress.

First, we have to talk about Southwest.

The commercial airline industry is low margin, and public airlines do need to scrounge every bit of revenue. But, you probably notice that Southwest is dead-last on this list.

It's not quite true to say that Southwest doesn't charge for bags. Its ""bags fly free"" policy applies only to the first two bags, and besides, it's more accurate to say that the cost to transport passengers' first two bags is bundled into the prices of their tickets.

But, they've been effective in associating ""free bags"" with Southwest. When you factor in that Southwest also either bundles or foroges other fees -- like change fees -- and that Southwest often comes in at the top of airline passenger satisfaction and branding surveys, it's worth asking wither there's cause-and-effect there.

Second, the U.S. Congress.

Because all throughout 2018, we heard rumors that Congress was going to crack down on bag fees. But at the very last minute -- literally, at 2.52 a.m. on a Saturday morning in September -- Congress passed a law that included some radical changes to the airline industry, but left out the bag fee restrictions.

Sensible people might wonder why the airlines would really care. If Congress capped bag fees at say, there would be nothing from stopping the airlines to move in lockstep to increase ticket prices to make up the difference.

In other words, they'd all just adopt the Southwest bundling strategy.

But, it turns out there's a key tax advantage to airlines when they charge fees on top of ticket prices, instead of just raising the underlying prices themsleves.

Tickets are subject to a federal 7.5 percent excise tax. But fees aren't subject to the same tax. So moving the $757 million that American, United, and Delta took in from bag fees to ticket prices could result in more than $56 million in taxes.","American, Delta and United Made $757 Million Selling This 1 Simple Thing.

35. Warren Gamaliel Harding Net worth: $1 million

Term: 1921-1923

President #29

The wrongdoing of his cabinet members overshadowed most of Harding’s presidency. However, the 29th president of the U.S. wasn’t involved with any of those criminal activities. Before getting into politics, Harding was a successful newspaper publisher, he served in the Ohio legislature and the US Senate, says History.com. William G. Harding basically had the majority of his net worth before becoming the Commander in Chief. His wife Mabel also came from substantial wealth — she was the daughter of a prominent banker, says 24/7 Wall St.

NEXT: He went bankrupt during the Great Depression in 1893 while governor of Ohio.



34. William McKinley Net worth: $1 million

Term: 1897-1901

President #25

William McKinley didn’t have a significant inheritance unlike a lot of the presidents on our list. He made his dough working various public service positions for 30 years. This included serving as a local prosecutor and a member of the House of Representatives. It seems like public service can make you some substantial cash, but not as much as being a company exec can. Unfortunately, Mr. McKinley went bankrupt during the Great Depression in 1893. At the time, he was governor of Ohio, says 24/7 Wall St. Even politicians were affected by the Great Depression! He was president until he was assassinated six months into his second term.

NEXT: At the time, the 14th president of the U.S. was the youngest man to assume the office.



33. Franklin Pierce Net worth: $2 million

Term:1853-1857

President #14

Like father like son! Franklin Pierce’s father was governor of New Hampshire. The 14th president himself got his start in politics at a young age, says History.com. He was just 24-years-old when he won the election to the New Hampshire state legislature. Not many 24-year-olds accomplish a feat such as that! At the time, 47-year-old Franklin Pierce was the youngest man to become president of the U.S. His wife, Jane Appleton, came from a well to do family. Appleton’s father was formerly president of Bowdoin College.

NEXT: Our 19th commander in chief came from a humble background but worked his way up to $3 million.



32. William Howard Taft Net worth: $3 million

Term: 1909-1913

President #27

Interestingly, Taft’s father-in-law used to work with a president in power a few years before him — Rutherford Birchard Hayes! (We’ll talk about him soon but we won’t tell you HOW soon.) An active attorney for two decades, Taft was president of the American Bar Association. The White House says that Taft was more interested in law rather than politics. He did hold various public office positions, as well as the presidency, so Taft must have liked public service to some extent.

NEXT: Our 19th commander in chief came from a humble background but worked his way up to $3 million.



31. Rutherford B. Hayes Net Worth: $3 million

Term: 1877-1881

President #19

Hayes came from a humble background — his father was a shopkeeper. He might have earned his $3 million net worth working as a lawyer for 15 years and his public service jobs. Besides commander in chief, Hayes was governor of Ohio and a member of the House, says MSN. Hayes’ career also included a stint fighting in the Civil War, says The White House. Down the line as he acquired wealth, Hayes was able to procure “Spiegel Grove.” This was a 10,000 square foot home that sat on 25 acres in Fremont, Ohio.

NEXT: He founded the college that eventually became SUNY of Buffalo in New York.



30. Millard Fillmore Net worth: $4 million

Term: 1850-1853

President #13

Neither this president nor his wife came from wealthy families. Fillmore is from the Finger Lakes country of New York, where he worked on his father’s farm and apprenticed with a cloth dresser. He attended one-room schools and eventually married the teacher, Abigail Powers. Fillmore did start the university that eventually became State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY), so his wealth could have come from that in addition to his work as a public servant. Besides serving as president, he was comptroller of New York and vice president, says The White House.

NEXT: This president once proposed to annex the Hawaiian islands, says the History Channel.



29. Benjamin Harrison Net worth: $6.1 million

Term: 1889-1893

President #23

Here’s another self-made president. Born on a farm by the Ohio River below Cincinnati, Benjamin Harrison didn’t come from a wealthy family and neither did his wife. Instead, he made all his money while he was a highly paid lawyer for 18 years. One of his biggest clients as a lawyer was Venezuela. Harrison assisted the country with settling a border dispute. Visible signs of his wealth were his large Victorian home located in Indianapolis, Indiana. Despite being wealthy, the U.S. Treasury’s surplus disappeared by the end of Harrison’s term, says the White House.

NEXT: He was the first president to die in office.



28. William Henry Harrison Net worth: $6.1 million

Term: 1841

President #9

William Henry WHO? You’ve probably not heard about Mr. Harrison because he was only president for a total of 31 days. The ninth president sadly died of typhoid or paratyphoid fever just a month into his tenure. Harrison became the first president to die in office. As far as his baller wealth goes, Harrison married into wealth. His wife’s pops was a judge and a landowner, says 24/7 Wall St. Our ninth president added to his assets when he inherited 3,000 acres near Charles City, Virginia from his late mother.

NEXT: Prior to becoming president, he served in the military for four decades.



27. Zachary Taylor Net worth: $7.1 million

Term: 1849-1850

President #12

Our 12th president of the United States was one that inherited his wealth from family (seems to be a common trait of our early commanders in chief, no?). Taylor inherited a lot of land in particular, says MSN. This included property in Mississippi, Kentucky, and Louisiana. Mississippi is where he had his plantation (seems to be a requirement of early presidents to have one) and he had a home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. MSN goes on to say Taylor made even more money in land speculation, leasing warehouses and having investments in bank and utility stocks. Taylor’s background was a Southern man through and through although he didn’t subscribe to most of the region’s political beliefs, says the White House. Taylor was born in Virginia but moved to Kentucky as an infant.

NEXT: This president came into power via the 25th amendment, replacing Nixon after the Watergate scandal.



26. Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. Net worth: $8.1 million

Term: 1974-1977

President #38

Gerald Ford didn’t have an inheritance to fuel his career, but he was able to work his way up on his own. Most of his career was in public service, says MSN, but he made enough money to load up on properties in Michigan and Colorado. Post-presidency, Ford cashed in on book advances and was on the boards of big-time companies. He earned himself a near $1 million doing this. Ford originally came into power after Nixon bowed out due to the Watergate scandal. “I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances,” Ford said. “This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.”

NEXT: This president won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.



25. James Earl Carter Net worth: $8.1 million

Term: 1977-1981

President #39

Things weren’t always easy as far as money goes for James “Jimmy” Carter. Carter’s dad owned a peanut farm in Georgia, leaving it to Jimmy after he died, says MSN. It took a while for Carter to make the farm successful but it finally was. Things went south with the peanut farm when Carter put it in a blind trust and left it unsupervised. Carter left the presidency in debt, sadly, but was able to rebound and make dough by writing books.

NEXT: There’s a conspiracy theory out there that claims this president had a secret meeting with aliens, says Disclose TV.



24. Dwight David Eisenhower Net worth: $9.1 million

Term: 1953-1961

President #34

A self-made president, Dwight D. Eisenhower held high ranking jobs before becoming commander in chief. He spent most of his life in the military, working his way up the ranks. He was also the 13th president of Columbia University in the city of New York. Columbia University Libraries says that he’d spend long times away from the university, most notably in 1950 when he was the first supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). As far as properties go, he owned a farm near Gettysburg, PA.

NEXT: This president was often referred to as the first “dark horse.”



23. James Knox Polk Net worth: $11.1 million

Term: 1845-1849

President #11

James K. Polk and his wife, Sarah Childress, both had fathers that were rich plantation owners and speculators. On top of their family wealth, Polk made a lot of his money during his public service jobs: speaker of the house and governor of Tennessee. Polk owned a 920-acre estate and 25 slaves to go along with it, says MSN. Not as much as other early presidents, however. He was referred to as a “dark horse,” meaning “unexpected winner” in politics.

NEXT: He’s known for his dramatic “Tear down this wall” speech at the former Berlin Wall.



22. Ronald Wilson Reagan Net worth: $14.2 million

Term: 1981-1989

President #40

Reagan became a movie star then president, all on his own without an inheritance. He started working in TV and movies for two decades and earned a lot of his wealth that way. He also made some sweet cash as General Electrics’ spokesman before becoming president, says MSN. Reagan’s wealth helped him buy some real estate, including a baller 688-acre estate near Santa Barbara, California. Like most former presidents, he wrote an autobiography which helped fund his wealthy lifestyle. Almost every president has a fan that’ll buy their book!

NEXT: He was famously disgraced for the Watergate scandal. Wonder who that might be…



21. Richard Milhous Nixon Net worth: $17.2 million

Term: 1969-1974

President #37

Richard Nixon, aka “Tricky Dick,” is, unfortunately, best known for his involvement in the Watergate scandal. Five men broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in the 1970s. Nixon’s administration evaded investigations of its involvement. Nixon subsequently resigned. As far as his wealth goes, Nixon didn’t inherit his wealth but instead made it through work and real estate, says MSN. He was a public servant most of his career and made money from David Frost interviews and book advances. He sold his New York townhouse and owned property in New Jersey, California, and Florida.

NEXT: His wife came from a wealthy, prominent family called the Quincys.



20. John Adams Net worth: $21.3 million

Term: 1797-1801

President #2

Adams wasn’t nearly as wealthy as his predecessor, Washington (read about him a bit later), but he and his wife came from money. Adams had received a healthy inheritance from his father and his lady, Abigail, came from the wealthy Quincy family, says MSN. What?! You’ve never heard of the Quincys?! They’re just about the most prestigious family in Massachusetts! In the 18th century that is…Adams’ wealth was evident just by looking at his 40-acre estate, Peacefield, and thriving law practice.

NEXT: This president became a lawyer without ever attending law school, says the Constitution Center.



19. John Quincy Adams Net worth: $23.3 million

Term: 1825-1829

President #6

Guess who his dad was? John Adams! Wow who would have thought? There’s been another father and son presidency situation we’re more familiar with — George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush (more about them in later slides!). Quincy Adams inherited some of dad’s wealth. For example, he inherited the Peacefield estate from John Adams, says MSN (this was the 40-acre estate we mentioned earlier). It also seems he inherited the temperament and viewpoints of his dad, says The White House.

NEXT: This late president was known as one of the United States’ humblest and most experienced.



18. George Herbert Walker Bush Net worth: $26.3 million

Term: 1989-1993

President #41

George H.W. Bush, father of president George W. Bush, came from a wealthy family. Bush made his own fortune with some offshore drilling and owned millions of dollars worth of property, says MSN. Most notably, there’s the Kennebunkport, Maine estate (it’s believed to be worth $5 million!). Despite his wealth, Bush was known for being unselfish, humble and experienced in public service work. He started in Congress, then served many government roles like the Ambassador to the U.N., Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in China and Director of Central Intelligence.

NEXT: He served multiple but not consecutive terms as president.



17. Grover Cleveland Net worth: $28.3 million

Term: 1885-1889, 1893-1897

President #22 & #24

Grover Cleveland seemed to have come from a humble background — his father was both a bookseller and a preacher. Cleveland possibly procured wealth from his work as a lawyer for 12 years and in public service. Besides president, he served as mayor of Buffalo, New York and governor of New York. Interestingly, he also made lots selling his estate outside D.C. Cleveland purchased “Westland Mansion,” an estate near Princeton, New Jersey. This president became the first to a lot of things: 1st democratic president after the civil war, first to serve two nonconsecutive terms, and more.

NEXT: He’s one of two presidents to have served as secretary of state, vice president and president.



16. Martin Van Buren Net worth: $29.3 million

Term: 1837-1841

President #8

Van Buren came to his wealth working as a lawyer. He might have earned a lot of his wealth while working in public office as well. MSN says he’s one of two men to serve as secretary of state, vice president and president! Like all early presidents, he had an estate. This 225 acre estate in upstate New York was called “Lindenwald.” He came from humble beginnings — he was born to a tavern keeper and farmer in Kinderhook, New York, says The White House.

NEXT: This president and his family decorated the White House with French imports and spoke French, says Encyclopedia Britannica.



15. James Monroe Net worth: $30.4 million

Term: 1817-1825

President #5

There seem to be a lot of early presidents that lost money towards the end of their lives. Take James Monroe for instance — he had a plantation with 3,500 acres, made lots of money during two terms as president, and his wife came from money. (His wife, Elizabeth Monroe, was the daughter of a rich British officer.) However, when Monroe got to retirement age, he was in debt and forced to sell his giant plantation, recounts MSN.

NEXT: He took up painting post-presidency, eventually putting together a book featuring his paintings called “Portraits of Courage,” says CNN.



14. George W. Bush Net worth: $39.5 million

Term: 2001-2008

President #43

George W. Bush’s initial wealth came from his family — he’s from the prominent Bush family and his father was the president of the United States from 1989 to 1993. Bush himself made some good cash as a businessman then governor of the state of Texas. Bush worked in the oil industry and owned baseball team the Texas Rangers once. Bush was known for facing 9/11 terrorist attacks, what his father called the “greatest challenge of any President since Abraham Lincoln,” says the White House. Bush left office an unpopular president, then started making money in speaking fees and book deals.

NEXT: He was the only president born in Hawaii.



13. Barack Hussein Obama Net worth: $40 million

Term: 2008-2016

President #44

Several publications can only provide estimations of Obama’s wealth, but it’s thought to be around $40 million. Post-presidency, Obama makes a six-figure pension and has made millions from his books, a Netflix deal and speaking engagements, says Business Insider. Everyone wants a piece of Obama. While president, he was known for passing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as “Obamacare” for short. He didn’t come from wealth — he was raised by a single mother from Kansas.

NEXT: During the Civil War, this former president found himself in debt and died poor. This seems to be a common theme of early presidents, no?



12. John Tyler Net worth: $57.7 million

Term: 1841-1845

President #10

Tyler was one of those presidents that came into wealth not through their careers, but family. He inherited a 1,000-acre tobacco plantation and had a wealthy first wife, Letitia. Eventually, Tyler bought his own estate called “Sherwood Manor” comprised of 1,600 acres. He holds the distinction of being the first to become president because his predecessor died, says The White House. Like most of our early presidents, he found himself in debt and died poor. How come all these guys were losing their money?

NEXT: He used a wheelchair, but there aren’t very many photos of him in it.



11. Franklin Delano Roosevelt Net worth: $66.8 million

Term: 1933-1945

President #32

Franklin Delano Roosevelt, known commonly as “FDR,” gained some of his wealth from inheritance and marriage, says MSN. He did have a financial slip up in 1919 when his mother had to bail him out. Clearly Roos,evelt was able to recover and work his way up to a $66.8 million net worth! Franklin Roosevelt held high ranking (and probably high paying) jobs before becoming president — e.g. he was assistant secretary of the Navy. Obvious indicators of his wealth were his properties in Georgia, Maine and New York as well as his “Springwood” estate.

NEXT: This president faced impeachment.



10. William Jefferson Clinton Net worth: $75.9 million

Term: 1993-2001

President #42

From an elite scene in Arkansas, Clinton came into Washington D.C. and shook things up. He was a very popular president with voters, despite his extramarital affair(s). Clinton and wife Hillary Rodham Clinton did not come from wealth. Instead, they worked their way up the ladder. Interestingly, he wasn’t quite wealthy — compared to other presidents — while he was in the White House. He and his wife made their money from paid speeches and book deals. MSN says that Bill Clinton made $15 million for his book My Life.

NEXT: This president made his initial wealth as a mining engineer.



9. Herbert Clark Hoover Net worth: $83 million

Term: 1929-1933

President #31

Herbert Clark Hoover started off as an orphan. He was raised by his uncle who was a doctor. Hoover turned his misfortune around, becoming a mining engineer, raking in a large salary for 17 years and having extensive holdings in various mining companies. Part of his engineering career took him to China. When he eventually became president, he found that he didn’t need his presidential salary and donated it to charity, much like our current commander in chief is doing. The White House says Hoover was known as “the Great Humanitarian.”

NEXT: This vice president stepped up to become commander in chief after JFK was assassinated.



8. Lyndon Baines Johnson Net worth: $109.3 million

Term: 1963-1969

President #36

Lyndon B. Johnson (often known as LBJ) took over the presidency when president John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was born in central Texas, where he experienced rural poverty growing up and working his way through Southwest Texas State Teachers College, says the White House website. LBJ acquired more and more land in Texas as time went on — 1,500 acres in Blanco County, says MSN. LBJ and his wife “Ladybird” Johnson owned a radio and TV station in Austin as well as other moderate holdings.

NEXT: He was one of our wealthiest presidents, but lost a lot of his wealth as he neared death.



7. James Madison Net worth: $113.3 million

Term: 1809-1817

President #4

What’s up with all these presidents living on estates with fancy names? James Madison lived on a 5,000-acre one named “Montpelier” in Orange County, Virginia, says MSN. The publication says he was the largest landowner in all of Orange County, Virginia at the time. Unfortunately for Mr. Madison, he lost a lot of his money at the end of his wealthy life because of the financial collapse of his plantation. Sadly, he was confined to his bed towards the end of his life, says James Madison: A Song of Virginia and a Founder of the Nation.

NEXT: He adopted an orphaned Native American boy named Lyncoya.



6. Andrew Jackson Net worth: $132.6 million

Term: 1829-1837

President #7

Known as “Old Hickory,” Jackson made his wealth in the military and also married into a rich family. This made him one of the wealthiest presidents in the 1800s, says MSN. Like his predecessors, Jackson owned a massive estate. Called “The Hermitage,” his estate was comprised of 1,050 acres. Jackson also owned over 300 slaves throughout his life, says MSN. Like a certain commander in chief we know today, Jackson sought to act as a representative of the common man, says The White House. Do you think someone from a wealthy background can represent the common people?

NEXT: He’s the youngest president in the United States’ history.



5. Theodore Roosevelt Net worth: $139.7 million

Term: 1901-1909

President #26

Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt was born into a prominent, rich family in 1858 New York City, says The White House. Roosevelt was gifted a big trust fund but lost most of his money on a ranching venture in the Dakotas, says MSN. He worked as an author to pay the bills. Lucky for him, he could make money writing unlike most authors… Most of his career was spent in public service jobs besides the presidency. Like other presidents, he had an estate of his own — a 235 acre one called “Sagamore Hill” in Long Island.

NEXT: He was one of our wealthiest presidents, but found himself in debt towards the end of his life.



4. Thomas Jefferson Net worth: $236.8 million

Term: 1801-1809

President #3

Sure, the American Revolution seemed like a scrappy operation compared to the United Kingdom’s redcoats trying to hang onto their colonies. But that doesn’t mean our founding fathers were scrappy by any means. Au contraire, they were ballin.’ Mr. Jefferson here is just one example. His 5,000-acre Virginia plantation, Monticello, was tended to by dozens of slaves. A lot of Jefferson’s property was given to him by his father, says MSN, but he made some of his own money working in politics before becoming president. Despite his wealthy life, he found himself in debt when he died.

NEXT: He was rumored to have had wooden teeth.



3. George Washington Net worth: $587 million

Term: 1789-1797

President #1

He’s probably one of the most well known men in the entire history of the United States. Washington was the first president of our nation and one of our wealthiest. This is partially due to him being America’s most well paid president (his salary was two percent of the budget in 1789, says MSN). Washington’s family came from money — his wife, Martha, inherited tons of property from her father. The pair lived on a baller plantation (Mount Vernon — ever heard of it?) that had FIVE separate farms on 8,000 acres. Like most founding fathers, he had slaves — 300 of them.

NEXT: A 2013 Gallup poll revealed this president as America’s favorite.



2. John Fitzgerald Kennedy Net worth: $1.1 billion

Term: 1961-1963

President #35

No name is more famous in American politics than “Kennedy.” The Kennedys are a powerful, elite family in American politics that have held many political positions. They’re both loved and despised. Needless to say, John Kennedy (often known as “JFK”) was born into great wealth because of his familial ties. Kennedy’s dad was the first chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). MSN says JFK’s money came from a shared trust with other family members. Kennedy’s wife, Jackie, was also born into wealth — she was an oil heiress.

NEXT: He’s the oldest — and richest — U.S. president in our nation’s history.

No. ,https://teamandroid.com/2019/05/16/google-pixel-3a-waterproof/,"Is Google Pixel 3a Waterproof?

Google announced the mid-range Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL phones last week. These new phones show Google changing the mid-range market for good with a much better camera and fast performance on a not-so-flagship hardware. These new Pixel phones had to make a cut between an amazing camera result and extra features like wireless charging, high-end processor and GPU. So, did waterproofing make the cut? Let’s take a look and see if the Google Pixel 3a is waterproof or not.

There are some features that we expect from every flagship phone, like fast wireless charging, multiple cameras at the back, top-of-the-line hardware etc. And water-proofing and resistance is one of those things that we expect phones to have.

Google Pixel Waterproof History

The very first Google Pixel did not have an IP rating, which means, no water and dust resistance. However, there are several videos online that proof the original Pixel to be tightly sealed and was fully capable of surviving an accidental dip in the water. Not just that, several YouTube creators even kept the original Pixel in a freezer for several hours to fully freeze the phone. And even then, the Pixel survived with no water or moisture damage.

Soon later, Google launched the Pixel 2 phones that came with a certified IP rating. Personally, I have used the Pixel 2 XL under water and never had any issues. I have even used it during rain to make calls, and it worked perfectly. Some users did report some speaker distortion after the phone was submerged in the water, but that was only temporarily and everything would get back to normal once the phone dried up.

And similarly, the Google Pixel 3 is also water and dust resistant. It has a water protection rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529.

Google Pixel 3a Waterproof?

Coming back to the Google Pixel 3a, a number of ‘extra’ features of a high-end phone didn’t make it to this mid-range phone. So yes, the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL phones are NOT water or dust resistant.

These phones may be tightly sealed and may even provide protection like the original Google Pixel, but they are not IP rated, officially. So why take the risk? We would highly recommend staying away from water and excessive dust.

Now that we know this phone does not have an IP rating, it is better to put on a waterproof case or keep your phone in a zip-lock bag when going to a beach. This way the bag will prevent any dust, sand or even water getting to your new Google Pixel 3a.

For daily use, we’d recommend using a case at all times.

How to Fix Water Damage?

This is a bit tricky. If your Pixel 3a took a dip in water, first thing, relax. Turn off your phone and wait. Wait for several hours before you even try to switch it back on. And most importantly, do not try to charge your phone if there is any moisture or water in the USB-C slot. That could fry up your USB-C for good.

The rice method is what you should try first. It is a popular method for electronic devices when they get water damaged or have moisture in them. You take a bowl of rice and place your phone in it while it is powered off. Now you keep your phone in the bowl for a day or two. Rice absorbs all the moisture so this trick has been proven and had worked for many people with their phones and other electronics.

Power on your phone. If you see any signs of distorted display screen, delayed touch feedback or if any of the buttons or slots seem to not work, that means you will have to send in your phone for repair. For the Pixel 3a, it will be better to look for an official service center or partner services for repair. This may cost you a lot depending on the extent of damages to your phone.

Pixel 3a Water-Proof Cases

Waterproof cases for the Google Pixel 3a are not yet available by any maker. We’ll update this page with more details when they are available for purchase.

Speaking to Empire Magazine, the director admitted he's a little bit behind when it comes to the MCU, but he's recently had a bit of a Marvel binge in order to prepare himself for his first viewing of Avengers: Endgame.

""I haven't been keeping up to date with them for, I guess, the last four years,"" said Tarantino. ""I think the only comic book movies I saw last year at theatres were Wonder Woman and Black Panther.""

""But about a couple of weeks ago I started catching up with some of the Marvel movies so I could go see Endgame. I just finished Captain America: Civil War, so next up is Doctor Strange.""

However, it's Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok that he's taken a particular liking to. ""I loved it,"" he said. ""It was my favourite one of the series since The Avengers – drastically my favourite.""

In the same interview, Tarantino also revealed that his Star Trek film will most definitely be R-rated – as if it was ever in doubt.

When asked if his Star Trek would be heavy on expletives, Tarantino replied: ""Oh yeah! It's an R-rated movie. If I do it, it'll be R-rated.""

He's writing a book. ,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/article/the-guy-behind-fyre-festival-has-found-a-new-way-to-take-your-money/vooffkupj,"Video above: Vlogger Austin Mills documents the chaos of Fyre Festival





The mastermind of the royal calamity that was Fyre Festival, Billy McFarland, is planning to write a ""tell all"" memoir about the ill-fated event while serving prison time for fraud.

In an exclusive interview with the

, acclaimed freelance editor Josh Raab said he was approached by McFarland's girlfriend who said he was writing a book titled

Promythus: The God of Fyre

.

Anastasia Ermenko is a Russian model who started dating McFarland after Fyre Festival. In an email to Raab, she said:

Last month 2 documentaries came out about the FYRE FESTIVAL but unfortunately both misrepresented the real events and Billy would like to share his story.

Fyre Festival was a luxury music festival founded by McFarland and rapper Ja Rule. The event failed - hundreds of attendees who paid thousands for tickets showed up to a remote island in the Bahamas where there wasn't enough shelter, food and security.

McFarland is serving a six-year sentence for fraud related to Fyre Festival and for selling fake tickets to high profile events like the Met Gala while he was out on bail. His girlfriend may be one of his last remaining allies.

Raab spoke to both McFarland and Ermenko about the book - which was going to be 800 handwritten pages by McFarland from prison detailing the ""raw"" story of Fyre that he feels Hulu and Netflix missed in their documentaries.

In the exchanges, McFarland hinted that there would be more festivals.

McFarland explained that he wanted to publish soon because the story would be invalid after the ""next events take place"". He said in an email:

Putting in terms of Wolf of Wall Street, the Festival will not be a one and done event — it's happening again, so the original story will lose the potential to be told and set the stage if it's not done before the next events take place.

Raab declined to write the book, but McFarland and Ermenko neglected to make him sign a non-disclosure agreement. So now, we are hearing all about it.

McFarland planned to publish on Amazon in April, but it's May and we're still to hear anything about

Promythus: The God of Fyre.

McFarland owes $26 million in restitution to investors and says he would use proceeds of the book to cover these costs, while giving money back to the Bahamian people whose livelihoods suffered from the failed Fyre Festival.

"""I disagree."" ",https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/ceo-of-united-airlines-says-he-cant-make-passengers-happy-ceo-of-delta-has-a-brutal-response.html,"Is it really impossible to make customers happy? Getty Images

Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.

I've been thinking a lot about happiness lately.

With respect to companies and their brands, you understand.

Recently, I wrote about a survey that suggested airlines lag far behind other categories in the happiness and love departments -- though Southwest came out best.

Many regular fliers might see why, although not all of this is the airlines' fault.

Still, in a recent interview with ABC News, United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz intimated that there's really nothing his airline can do to make passengers happy.

He said:

""It's become so stressful from when you leave, wherever you live, to get into traffic, to find a parking spot, to get through security. Frankly, by the time you sit on one of our aircraft... you're just pissed at the world.""

Well, not always.

I've actually had pleasant experiences on United, some of them even within the past year.

Yet Munoz added that no cookie or smile could make passengers feel better.

Oddly, his belief seems to be shared by other members of his management team.

It was moving, then, when Munoz's views were put to Delta CEO Ed Bastian by Marketplace.

His response was, well, quite direct:

""I disagree. Those certainly aren't Delta customers he's speaking to.""

Could it be that Delta customers somehow don't feel stressed by finding a parking spot and going through security?

Could it be they arrive at their seats only too delighted to be flying Delta?

In my most recent experience with Delta, I was indeed delighted to get on the plane, but only because the airline uses Terminal 1 at San Francisco Airport.

This is a building designed by those with a pungent distaste for their fellow humans. (It's now being redeveloped.)

Still, Bastian insisted his customers tell surveys they're more and more pleased with the airline:

""This industry is about more than just airplanes and technology. It's about people. And we have wonderful people that provide great service.""

There's a wider issue here.

Munoz may be right that the rigors of travel, the tiresome nature of security procedures and, frankly, the minimal space airlines give passengers -- especially in Economy Class -- don't encourage those passengers to delight in flying.

This doesn't mean, however, that a business can't still motivate its staff to provide something if not exceptional, then certainly better than mundane or even defeatist.

Sheer thoughtfulness -- which, yes, might include a cookie, a smile, a shared joke, or a proactive helping hand -- can make the difference between a pleasant customer experience and a dreadful one.

For example, last week I flew TAP Air Portugal, and everything from the kind attitude of its flight attendants to the simple, thoughtful presentation of (free) food in Economy Class made the whole experience far better than it should have been, given that we were on a relatively cramped Airbus A321neo and flying into Heathrow Airport.

Munoz's words might have expressed his own exasperation with things (he believes) his airline simply can't control.

But you have to look at your customers' realities and decide to commit time, thought and, yes, even money to make them want to come back to you.

If you're in a service business -- and there are those who believe airlines are only in the business of getting you from one place to another -- dedicating yourself to service on a daily basis is very hard.

I actually think United is trying to do that.",The CEO of United Airlines Says He Can't Really Make Passengers Happy. The CEO of Delta Has a Brutal Response

Concerned mum embarrassed as she discovers what huge black mark in kid's mouth actually is

A concerned mum was filled with fear when she noticed a huge black mark on her the top of her daughter's mouth.

Darian Depreta was playing with her gorgeous little girl Bella when she spotted the massive circular mark.

She tried to wipe it off but started to panic when it didn't disappear.

She said: ""So I'm playing with Bella today and notice the roof of her mouth is black.

""I try wiping it to see if it would come off, and it didn't. I immediately call Chandler, my mom and best friend in a panic.

""I make her a doctors appointment that was about 30 minutes from the time I noticed her mouth.""

When they got to the GP, the nurse also unsuccessfully tried to wipe it off, then said she had never seen anything like it.

Doctors then suggested it could be a birth mark but Darian, who lives in the US, insisted it wasn't as she checks her mouth regularly to clean it.

Darian said: ""I'm now being told that my daughter will be set up with 2 specialists. After insisting it wasn’t a birthmark on the roof of her mouth, the NP decided to take another look at this medical mystery.

""I point out it looks a little white on the side and she really gets in there trying to scrape it.""

And then they realised what it actually was...

While Darian is embarrassed about the situation, she appreciates it could have been much worse.

Posting on Facebook, she writes: ""Yes she could have choked on it and I’m thanking God she did not.

""The only reason it was posted was because after crying, panicking and trying to figure out what it was (the doctors didn’t even know) , she was ok. The laugh was after the storm of it all.

""Asphalt gets very hot and can burn your pet's paws, so walk your dog on the grass if possible,"" the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) urged. But sometimes it can be hard to tell. Luckily, there's a quick and easy test, courtesy of Moon Valley Canine Training, to see if the street temperature is safe enough for a walk with your dog. Put the back of your hand on the pavement, and if you can't keep it there for five seconds, it's too hot for your pup's feet.

Her father, Robert Kardashian, was an attorney who gained notoriety serving on O.J. Simpson's defense team, but Kardashian West's own interest in the law grew from her work with CNN commentator and criminal justice reform advocate Van Jones on his efforts to ""shrink the incarceration industry."" Kardashian West made a much-publicized visit to the Oval Office to advocate for Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old great-grandmother who was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent drug offense. After her meeting with President Donald Trump, Johnson was granted clemency. ""I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society,"" Kardashian West tells Vogue. ""I just felt like the system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more."" Kardashian West, who does not have an undergraduate degree, knew the unlikely choice ""would be met with an eye roll for the ages."" But even more surprising to some is the fact that the entrepreneur and social media influencer won't need to attend law school before she takes the bar exam, which she plans to do in 2022. According to The Washington Post, California does not require a law degree as a prerequisite for taking the bar exam. Neither do Vermont, Virginia or Washington.

Instead, these states allow people to become ""law readers"" by apprenticing with a practicing lawyer for a designated amount of time each week. Programs vary from state to state. Kardashian West is participating in the California Law Office or Judge's Chamber Program, which requires applicants to complete a form giving ""Notice of Intent to Study in a Law Office or Judge's Chambers"" and pay an initial fee of $158, as well as additional paperwork and $105 fees to be submitted every six months throughout the program. After one year as an apprentice, applicants qualify to take the First-Year Law Students' Examination, sometimes known as the ""baby bar."" If they pass this exam, legal hopefuls are permitted to continue studying for three more years. The program requires a total of four years as an apprentice at a law office or in a judge's chamber. Kardashian West says she has been completing 18 hours of weekly supervised study since July, under the supervision of two mentor lawyers, Jessica Jackson and Erin Haney of #cut50, an Oakland-based prison reform organization co-founded by Jackson and Van Jones.

Residents just bought their soda in the suburbs. ,https://www.dailywire.com/news/philadelphia-implements-soda-tax-it-doesnt-go-amanda-prestigiacomo,"The citizens of Philadelphia have been rocked by a tax on sugary drinks like soda, although the hike was intended to improve their health.

As outlined by Hotair on Saturday, the “soda tax” has actually led to Philadelphia residents traveling outside the city to buy their soda (and likely other goods), decreased the city’s revenue, and led to layoffs in the local beverage industry and cut hours for employees at small markets. It did not, however, lead to an increase in healthier beverage purchases in the city.

When the soda tax was first announced, workers at Pepsi took a hit. “With sales slumping because of the new Philadelphia sweetened beverage tax, Pepsi said Wednesday that it will lay off 80 to 100 workers at three distribution plants that serve the city,” philly.com reported in March of 2017.

And last month, the local outlet reported that the owner of Acme Markets, who has 16 stores in Philadelphia, had to cut employees’ hours because of the tax: “The beverage tax fell on about 4,000 items. In Acme city stores, soda sales dropped as much as 80 percent. Sales of other items covered by the tax, such as juices, creamers and energy drinks, were down 30 percent, and the number of customers declined by 5 percent. Philly stores cut an average of 150 to 200 employee hours per week, resulting in lighter paychecks for employees.”

But the hit the employees took did not equate to a win for the “health” of its citizens. As noted by Hotair, Philadelphia residents were traveling outside the city to avoid the tax hike on their drinks.

A CNN report on a study from medical journal JAMA focused in on the 51% drop in city soda purchases, but admitted: “While researchers found that sales of sugary beverages fell in Philadelphia after the tax, beverage sales in nearby towns and counties without the tax went up. That suggests people may have been traveling to get their soda at a reduced price.”

“People stopped buying their soda in the city (and almost undoubtedly a lot of other shopping list items) and decided to shop where prices were lower,” Hotair noted.

So was there at least an uptick in healthier beverage purchases because of the tax? Nope. “Philadelphia did not see an increase in sales of untaxed beverages such as bottled water,” CNN reported.

CNN did not discuss the revenue hit Philadelphia took, but Hotair did: “The tax on soda increased by 17%, but the sales fell by 51%. So, let’s look at this assuming one million ounces of soda was sold annually before the tax went into effect. If sales had remained the same, the city would have realized $62,400.00 in revenue instead of $54,300.00. But with the volume cut in half, they managed to slash their revenue to $31,200.00.”","BACKFIRE: Philadelphia Implemented Soda Tax, But It Didn’t Go As Planned"

I am that person who hates drinking water. Where others enjoy a satisfying thirst quencher, I suffer through a barrage of sulfur, algae, swimming pool, and old metal pipes. Most days I avoid the issue entirely, subsisting on coffee, herbal tea, and the occasional LaCroix. But a few months ago, I began to suspect that chronic dehydration was the reason I continually felt tired and achy. So, in an effort to overcompensate my way to better life habits, I decided to slosh through a feat known across the internet as the Water Gallon Challenge: drinking a gallon per day for a month, with the promise of glowing skin and a lot more energy. Given my taste sensitivities, I went the filtered route and brought with me a hoard of limes, cucumbers, and sea salt, plus an emergency stash of electrolyte mix and a journal to track my energy, yoga performance, and bathroom breaks. Here’s how it went.

Day 1: I’m peeing every 15 minutes. How in the hell am I supposed to get anything done?

Day 2: I did not think it was physically possible to pee more than I did yesterday (21 times), yet here we are, 23 times. Additional instances of bodily rebellion include an afternoon of mild nausea and a slight headache.

Day 4: I didn’t feel like a 70-year-old woman when I got out of bed this morning. I deep-cleaned my house with the stamina of an old-school Disney princess. Is water the magical cure for the generalized fatigue my doctor insists is not a real thing?

Day 5: Yes! Water is life! I no longer hobble into my day with my feet and spine curled up like dry leaves. I thought this experiment would be miserable, but I totally get it now. (Though to be clear, water—even filtered water—still tastes disgusting without flavor enhancements.)

Day 7: Can we talk about how good I am at yoga right now? My hamstrings are much more flexible, and my back bends with ease. Even better, I have energy afterward, and I’m not horribly sore the next day.

Day 10: A switch to water that’s been ultrapurified by reverse osmosis (plus “carbon polishing” and UV sterilization) has proved revelatory. It’s fully palatable and delicately sweet, without a hint of chlorine. I’m now the proud owner of a refillable three-gallon jug.

Day 14: I crave water first thing in the morning instead of coffee. I don’t recognize myself anymore.

Day 19: The peeing has decreased to ten times per day. I’m still acutely aware of how much water I’m flushing down the toilet, so I’ve donated $30 to Charity: Water, which funds clean-water projects in 26 countries.

Day 24: My massage therapist confirms that my muscles and fascia are noticeably looser. She’s shocked to learn that before this, in the two-plus years she’s been trying to fix my body, I had been drinking barely any water.

Day 32: Oops, the month is over and I didn’t even notice—hydration is routine, and I’m loving it. Am I going to keep guzzling 128 ounces every day? Not unless I’m sweating buckets. But you better believe I’ll keep sipping on glorious, ultrapurified water like my well-being depends on it.

Fluid Dynamics

Nicole Lund, a nutritionist at New York University’s Langone Sports Performance Center, explains the basics of hydration.

How much: “Proper hydration means 85 ounces of water a day from food and beverages, plus more to replenish what you lose when exercising.” (That’s roughly four ounces of water for every quarter-pound of weight lost during your workout.)

Energy and performance: “Physiological changes occur even in the early stages of dehydration, including decreased blood volume and less oxygen delivered to working tissues. These changes make it harder to sweat, which will increase body temperature and heart rate and make you feel more fatigued during exercise.”

Bathroom breaks: Frequent trips to the restroom are normal with increased water intake, Lund says. “As with anything else that you change drastically, your body needs time to adjust if you start drinking a lot more.”

The bottom line: “We all wake up slightly dehydrated. The easiest change you can make is to have a big glass of water first thing in the morning.”",What Happens When You Drink a Gallon of Water a Day?
Illinois. ,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/05/11/the-11th-state-to-legalize-recreational-pot-will-b.aspx,"In terms of momentum, the marijuana industry has been practically unstoppable in recent years. Once considered a taboo topic that lawmakers regularly swept under the rug, cannabis has now become a mainstream topic in the United States, as evidenced by the fact that 2 out of 3 Americans support broad-based legalization, according to Gallup.

Cannabis favorability has also been the driving force of legalizations at the state level. In 24 years, we've gone from having zero approved medical or recreational weed states to 33 states with medical pot laws on their books. Of these 33 states, 10 allow for adults to consume cannabis, with nine having OK'd the retail sale of pot (sorry, Vermonters).

With pot revenue picking up at the state level, and polling clearly favoring legalization, it looks to be only a matter of time before new states take the plunge from the medical or recreational side of the equation. But, to be clear, recreational sales are expected to bring in the lion's share of legal marijuana revenue in the United States.

The 11th state to legalize recreational weed will be...

So, which state looks to have an inside track on becoming the 11th to legalize adult-use marijuana? Had you asked a few months ago, it looked to be a neck-and-neck battle between New Jersey and New York. Unfortunately, efforts to legalize marijuana in both states fell apart, and neither looks to be in a position to pass legislation anytime soon. Instead, the Land of Lincoln appears to be in the pole position to become the 11th recreationally legalized state.

As reported by Time and the Chicago Tribune last weekend, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, announced that he had reached an agreement with key lawmakers in the state's legislature to legalize recreational marijuana by Jan. 1, 2020. The bill would allow residents of Illinois to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis (a little more than one ounce), with out-of-staters allowed to possess up to 15 grams. Illinois residents would also be allowed to grow up to five plants. And, as with all other legal states, the age limit for purchases would be set at 21 and older.

In addition to simply legalizing adult-use weed, the bill announced by Pritzker would expunge certain cannabis convictions (e.g., misdemeanors and Class 4 felonies), and include a $20 million low-interest loan program. This loan program would aid applicants in opening a licensed cannabis business who have lived in communities with high crime rates, or in communities with a high rate of incarceration or arrest for marijuana offenses.

Then, there are the highly lucrative taxes on recreational pot. Cultivators and processors would pay 7% of their gross sales to dispensaries, with consumers paying at least a 10% tax rate on recreational cannabis products. Products with less than 35% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content -- the cannabinoid that gets a user high -- will bear a 10% tax rate, with products over 35% THC content (e.g., concentrates) featuring a 25% tax rate. Cannabis-infused beverages will sport a 20% tax rate. And, just for good measure, municipalities and counties can add on their own separate tax rates, which peak at 3% for municipalities, and up to 3.5% for unincorporated counties. At least 10% of the revenue generated from legalizing recreational pot would help Illinois cover unpaid bills.

According to the governor's office, even though legalization would take hold on Jan. 1, 2020, recreational licenses for dispensaries wouldn't be issued until May or June 2020.

These pot stocks are champing at the bit for Illinois to legalize recreational marijuana

As we saw from the Garden State and Empire State, even so-called sure things can fall apart. While the pathway to legalization looks clear now, the bill will undoubtedly face opposition. But should Illinois become the 11th state to OK adult-use marijuana, there would be quite a few happy campers in the cannabis industry.

For starters, MedMen Enterprises ( MMNFF 3.94% ) would be doing the happy dance. Although the upscale, vertically integrated dispensary operator has but one open location in Oak Park, it would make MedMen's $682 million all-stock deal to buy privately held PharmaCann look all the sweeter. You see, PharmaCann was initially awarded six medical marijuana licenses in Illinois, which was tops in the state at the time of the award. It has four open dispensaries that serve about 80% of the Chicagoland market, and it has two relatively local production facilities. With the infrastructure already in place, MedMen would simply need to apply for a recreational license, or amend its existing medical pot licenses, to get a piece of what could be a multibillion-dollar market.

Recreational weed legalization in the Land of Lincoln would also be a feather in the cap for Canopy Growth ( CGC -5.00% ), which announced the contingent acquisition of Acreage Holdings ( ACRGF ) for $3.4 billion last month. If the U.S. federal government legalizes marijuana, within a 90-month time frame Canopy will have the right to acquire Acreage, which currently has cultivation, processing, or retail operations in 20 states -- best among vertically integrated dispensary operators. Among those 20 states is Illinois, where Acreage has a cultivation farm and two dispensaries. In other words, it would further entrench Canopy Growth in one of America's key markets.

The largest vertically integrated dispensary by license count (assuming all pending acquisitions close), Harvest Health & Recreation ( HRVSF ), also stands to benefit. In March, Harvest Health announced that it'd be acquiring privately held Verano Holdings for $850 million in an all-stock deal. Verano currently has two Zen Leaf dispensaries located in Illinois (one in Chicago and the other in St. Charles). While Harvest Health will have 130 retail store licenses in 17 states (again, assuming all acquisitions close), you can count on Illinois becoming a reasonably important part of its long-term strategy.

Now, we simply watch and wait to see if Illinois lawmakers can deliver the green as the governor has promised.",The 11th State to Legalize Recreational Pot Will Be...
"""I eat ass."" ",https://www.fox13news.com/news/florida-man-arrested-for-refusing-to-remove-vulgar-bumper-sticker-theyre-just-words,"article

A Florida man who was jailed after refusing to remove what authorities called an obscene sticker from his vehicle's window said Tuesday that he is fighting the charges and will defend his constitutional right to free speech.

Dillon Shane Webb, 23, was arrested Sunday and charged with misdemeanor counts of violating Florida's obscenity law and resisting an officer without violence, a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report said.

Webb told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he plans to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit against the sheriff's office.

""I'm tired of police forces thinking they are above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,"" Webb said.

A deputy stopped Webb in Lake City because of a vehicle sticker crudely describing a sexual appetite, the sheriff's report said. When told about the reason for the stop, Webb reportedly said, ""They're just words.""

Wedd said the deputy seemed angry from the start of the traffic stop.

""Like the whole time, he was just really rude,"" Webb told the AP. ""It just felt to me like his goal was to get me in jail.""

The deputy said he asked Webb how a parent of a small child would explain the meaning of the words, and Webb said that ""it would be up to the parent.""

Webb told the AP that he didn't imagine the sticker doing any serious damage to children.

""I've had parents drive by me with their kids taking pictures,"" Web said. ""They point and laugh and giggle, and they go on about their day.""

Webb said he had the sticker on his truck for less than a week before his traffic stop. He said he and several friends had all decided to get similar stickers as a group joke.

""I guess this cop just didn't find it funny, and he just thought he has to put me in jail,"" Webb said.

The deputy initially cited Webb for obscenity with a notice to appear in court, the report said. The deputy told Webb to alter the sticker to change the derogatory part, but Webb refused.

""I said I'm not removing any letters on my sticker because that's in violation of my First Amendment rights as a tax-paying citizen,"" Webb said.

The deputy then charged Webb with resisting and took him to jail. Webb was released several hours later on $2,500 bond.

Webb's vehicle had been towed when he was arrested. He said the sticker was still in place when he retrieved the vehicle.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida released a statement Tuesday questioning why the sheriff's office was wasting resources on such a traffic stop.

""Shouldn't police officers spend their time serving and protecting communities and not pulling Floridians over for speech that is already protected by the First Amendment?"" ACLU spokeswoman Casey Bruce-White said in a statement. ""Using the excuse that a child would see and ask questions about this particular bumper sticker is absurd.""

The sheriff's office told the AP that deputy had probable cause of a violation of criminal law and took action. ""If the law is faulty then the legislature can address that or if the law is unconstitutional then the judiciary will address it, Sgt. Murray Smith said, adding that the defendant will have his day in court.

Webb said he wasn't even aware of the state's obscenity law, but after reviewing it since his arrest, he said it needs to be changed. He acknowledged that his sticker could be considered vulgar by some, but the law doesn't really define what that is.

""What's vulgar to me might not be vulgar to somebody else,"" Webb said.

Nothing. ,https://www.dailywire.com/news/la-writer-brought-maga-hat-vegan-restaurant-heres-paul-bois,"As a case study in American political tribalism in the age of President Trump, a Los Angeles writer wore a MAGA hat to an ultra-liberal vegan restaurant in the city to see what sort of adventures would unfold. Quite shockingly, people actually proved his thesis wrong.

The article by Joel Stein in Los Angeles Magazine confronts the fact that Americans hate each other in the age of President Trump, a fever he himself admits to having been inflicted with at times.

“More than 42 percent of people in each party think those in the other party are ‘downright evil,’ 20 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans think we’d be better off if members of the other party ‘just died,'” Stein writes. “The anger is so ubiquitous that even I’ve been infected. I saw an elderly man walking toward me on the Ferndell Trail in Griffith Park wearing a red hat, and I hate-stared him until he got close enough that I could see it had a USC logo on it. I avoided talking to a nice dad at my son’s old school because there was a rumor that he voted for Trump.”

Stein has been researching political tribalism for his upcoming book, oddly titled “In Defense of Elitism.” He admits that his research has led him to see some Trump supporters in a different light, such as when he visited Miami, Texas, only to find out that the people there were so nice that they “fed me in their homes or paid the server before our check arrived.”

“I worry that my side isn’t as friendly,” Stein admits. “We’ve harassed politicians out of restaurants, chanted threats outside a Fox News anchor’s home, and gone off on me for asking other parents if putting on a play about Native Americans despite the fact that there are no Native Americans in our school is really that evil.”

In light of all this, Stein devised a little social experiment: wear the iconic Make America Great Again hat to the ultra-liberal Café Gratitude in Larchmont, which he describes as a “vegan hipster restaurant.” It’s a restaurant so liberal that when the establishment sold a “Make America Grateful Hat,” customers complained that it took President Trump’s evil too lightly.

“I didn’t want to give $25 to Trump’s re-election campaign, so I bought a knockoff hat made in China for $8 on Amazon,” Stein writes. “The hate is so strong in me that I thought it was more ethical to support the Chinese government than Trump.”

Stein admits to being terrified upon his journey to the restaurant, fearing the absolute worst could happen, recalling the incident at Dodger Stadium where a guy ended up in a nine-month coma for wearing a San Francisco Giants hat. When he arrived at Café Gratitude, however, his expectations were surprisingly disproven. In fact, Stein learned some interesting insight about people on his own side — they don’t hate Trump or his supporters nearly as much as they profess.

“I glanced around the room, and no one gave me a dirty look,” Stein writes. “No one walked up to yell at me about Charlottesville or caged children. The guy with the ear twig pulled out a newspaper called the SJW, which I figured was a publication for Social Justice Warriors until I looked again and saw it was The Wall Street Journal.”

“Before I left, I asked the black waiter, Darick Thomas, how he felt about my hat,” Stein continues. “‘I don’t care. At all. Really. At all! I look at a hat and that doesn’t tell me who the person is,’ he said. “‘I’m not against Trump. He says some smart things; he says some dumb things.'”

Throughout Stein’s whole time at the restaurant, only one person, a patron, openly expressed disapproval of his MAGA hat. “Is that guy wearing a f***ing MAGA hat?” the patron asked at the counter.

Stein’s article ends on a quasi-confused note, illustrating how his experience throughout his research has stifled his narrative, so much so that he strives to keep his beliefs about Trump intact. He recalls a moment when his friend saw a man with a swastika tattoo on his neck frolicking through the park in some kind of Instagram photo shoot, expressing frustration that nobody confronted him.

“The far right has become so normalized that no one said anything to a guy in a MAGA hat at Café Gratitude,” Stein concludes. “I Am Not Sure How Great That Is.”",LA Writer Wore A MAGA Hat Into An Ultra-Liberal Vegan Restaurant. Here’s What Happened.
Twice. ,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/wont-believe-many-times-ted-135800381.html,"You Won't Believe How Many Times Ted Bundy Actually Escaped From Prison

From Women's Health

Ted Bundy, the infamous serial killer who murdered at least 30 women, escaped from custody twice before his final arrest.

His first escape came when he jumped out of second story law library window, and his second happened when he lost enough weight to squeeze through a hole in his cell ceiling.

Bundy's story has been brought into the spotlight again with the release of Netflix's biopic, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile.

Ted Bundy, the notorious serial killer and rapist-who is back in the spotlight thanks to the recent Ted Bundy Tapes documentary and upcoming Netflix biopic, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile-actually escaped prison twice before being executed under the death penalty.

It begs the question: How did such a notorious serial killer escape from prison so much?

Bundy's first escape happened while he was in jail in Aspen, Colorado to stand trial for the murder of Caryn Campbell, a 23-year-old nurse who was found dead in Snowmass, Colorado in 1975.

Since Bundy was assisting in his own defense (he actually attended law school for a short time), he was allowed to use the law library on the second floor of the courthouse where the prison was located, according to ABC News. He also wasn't required to wear shackles or handcuffs while walking into or around the library, and he noticed how easy it would be escape, according to recordings between him and his prison psychologist, Dr. Al Carlisle.

So, on June 7, 1977, Bundy took his chance while he was locked in the library and the prison guard left for a smoke. Bundy jumped out the window and sprinted for the mountains.

“The windows are open, and the fresh air is blowing through. And the sky was blue, and I said, 'I'm ready to go,' and walked to the window and jumped out,"" Bundy told Carlisle, per ABC News. ""Honest to god, I just got sick and tired of being locked up.""

It took about ten minutes for anyone to realize Bundy had escaped. Once the guards saw he was gone, city police were notified, roadblocks were placed at both ends of Aspen, and all cars that were leaving the city were checked. But by then, Bundy was long gone in the mountains, where he found and broke into a cabin to stay for a few days.

Story continues

Eventually, he headed back into Aspen, where he stole a car that was later pulled over for reckless driving. He was free for a total of six days before being placed back in prison.

His second escape, on December 30, 1977, was much more complex. After being moved to a prison in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, Bundy started to lose weight-on purpose. He carved around an opening that already existed in the ceiling of his cell (meant for a light fixture that wasn’t installed), and was able to climb through to the ventilation ducts. He even left books under his blanket to make it appear he was still in the cell, sleeping.

According to Bundy's attorney at the time, he dropped down from the ducts into one of the guards apartments in the building, changed into the guard's clothes, and walked out of the prison.

After leaving jail, Bundy boarded a flight to Chicago, took a train to Ann Arbor, Michigan, drove south to Atlanta, and finally got on a bus to his final desination: Tallahassee, Florida, per ABC News.

It was then, when Bundy was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list and, unfortunately, when he killed his final known victims before being arrested for a final time on February 15, 1978 in Pensacola, Florida. That was the end of Bundy's escapes from prison-he was executed via electric chair on January 24, 1989.

“It doesn’t matter how you record your notes, as long as you do.” Bill Gates.

While I may not 100% agree with Gates here—some note-taking systems do seem to work better than others—science shows that note-taking itself has many benefits. Let’s have a quick look at what these are.



Better learning. According to research, note-taking allows you to better remember the stuff you read. This is because the effort required to take notes helps form new pathways in the brain and encode the information in a way that stores it better in your long-term memory. This does not happen as effectively when passively taking information in.

These drawings could represent concepts, relationships, or terms you want to remember better. This is called The Drawing Effect. Hand-written notes are better. If you can, try hand-written notes. Studies have found that taking notes by hand is better for learning and memory than taking notes on a computer.

Classic note-taking systems

Everyone has a slightly different way to take notes, but for those who don’t already have a framework, there are various tested and proven note-taking techniques you can try to make your notes more effective.



The Cornell Method. This note-taking system was created by in the 1940s by Walter Pauk, a professor at Cornell University. You need to divide a piece of paper into three sections: notes, cues, and summary. Take notes in the main area, and add cues such as key points and action items in the left-side column. After your meeting, class, event, or when you are done watching a video or reading a blog post, take a few minutes to summarise everything at the bottom of the page. I personally like using this particular note-taking system when sitting in a lecture or at a conference with pen and paper.



The Mind Map. The concept of mapping information in a visual way using branching traces back centuries. This note-taking method is great for visual learners and can help maximise your active learning by actively forming connections between concepts. Write the central topic or start of a conversation in the middle, then draw nodes around this topic with related ideas. And if you want to take mind mapping to the next level, give Roam Research a try. It’s mind mapping on steroids.



The Charting Method. I personally find this one not flexible enough for most of the content I consume, but it can be powerful for topics that can be broken into categories, such as similarities and differences, dates, events, etc. Each row is used to describe an element of the idea you are studying, and each column lets you detail aspects of the corresponding element. As you can see, it only works with very specific types of structured data.

These are the more traditional note-taking methods. Another one I personally find particularly useful to turn my information input (consumption) into creative output (creation) is the Zettelkasten method. Despite the complicated name, it’s actually pretty simple, and allows you to avoid the common pitfall of taking lots of notes without ever interacting with them ever again. The book How to Take Smart Notes offers a great introduction to this note-taking system.



I hope you find these useful and start taking notes more often. It’s a very effective way to be more productive and more creative by ensuring the information you consume gets stored in your long-term memory and is easily retrievable any time you want to create original content.",The science of note-taking

If that weren't enough, the millionaire co-founder of telecommunications company Boost Mobile (USA) also hacks his diet: He eats five cans of sardines every day to maintain his health and energy.

Indeed, the silver-scaled fish in a can are dense with nutrients. One serving of the oily pilchards packs as much as 17 grams of protein and 50 percent of your recommended daily calcium intake for just 90 to 150 calories. Whether in oil or in water, they also are laden with omega-3 fatty acids (61 percent), which are good for lowering cholesterol levels and preventing blood clotting, and vitamin B12 (338 percent), known for assisting in red blood cell formation. Cooper said that on the set of ""Adventure Capitalists,"" where entrepreneurs pitch their adventure sport products to investors, he became known as ""Sardine"" among the production staff. ""Not the best nickname, but it stuck."" While a bit unusual, he says his daily sardine habit works.

“I had this kind of revelation and it honestly changed my life.

“When I felt how freeing it was, I really wanted to spread that feeling and help other people with big noses to embrace theirs too.”

She added: “I want this to have a bigger effect on the fashion and beauty industries. I want women with big noses to be in TV adverts in movies, and magazines.

“Once we see that, I think it will inspire younger generations to make them realize that big noses can be beautiful.”

Despite originally thinking that only women would get in touch, Sanghani says she has been receiving messages all day from men who have struggled with their big-nose insecurity.

She said: “I think it comes from not seeing anybody who looks like you when you’re watching TV or movies or reading magazines.

“Everybody who is portrayed as beautiful, like the leading heroine in a movie or a Disney princess, has a small nose.

“From a really young age, you just assume that having a small nose equals beautiful.”

Sanghani, who was held back as a teenager because she felt “ugly,” says she has been touched by how many people have shared a side-on picture with her online.

One supporter praised her campaign, saying: “Finally someone who dares say that a strong-nosed woman can be beautiful in a world where miniature noses are the standard.”

She appeared Tuesday on “Good Morning Britain,” where viewers were asked: “Is the world against big noses?”

The program was bombarded with replies from viewers.

One said: “I’ve hated my nose for as long as I can remember. Big noses look manly.

“I’ve twice almost had a ‘👃 job’ but needed the money for more important things (important to my family).”

Another said: “Bullied at school for my nose that ‘looked like that girl from The Grinch’ hated it until I left school and realized it added character.”

Someone else added: “Big noses are cool! Took me many years to realize this thanks to society but I do now.”

Others took the campaign less seriously: “Lord nose why you are running this story….can’t you sniff out a less ridiculous one?”

And who nose … maybe size does matter

Male monkeys with large noses have more females in their harems — proving that size does matter, according to a team of scientists.

Researchers studying proboscis monkeys in Malaysia found that males with exaggerated masculine traits, such as big noses, “serve as advertisements to females in mate selection.”

Those involved in the study from Cardiff University, Kyoto University and Sabah Wildlife Department and the Danau Girang Field Centre in Malaysia say the new evidence points to both male-male competition and female choice as contributing to the evolution of enlarged male noses.

The primate, which is native to Borneo, sports a sizeable snout, which Dr. Sen Nathan, assistant director of Sabah Wildlife Department and a Ph.D. student at Cardiff University and Danau Girang Field Centre, said had long been admired as an “extremely attractive” visual feature by biologists.",Why pictures of big noses have taken over your social feeds

Purple Paint Law can save valuable lumber

Purple paint on boundary line trees or fence posts means NO TRESPASSING, just as a green light means go and a red light means stop. But how can the purple paint law possibly save money for a woodland owner?

Just think. In the past, if woodland owners wanted to post their land against trespass, they would almost always nail a sign to a tree.

I have seen black walnut, white oak and red oak veneer logs ruined by such a practice. Think of the hundreds, if not thousands of butt logs, the most valuable log in a tree, that were affected!

In the mid-1990s, the Missouri State Legislature passed the Purple Paint Law, probably never realizing they were going to save millions of future butt logs. The law reads as follows: ""The owner or lessee of any real property may post the property by placing identifying purple paint marks on trees or posts around the area to be posted. Each paint mark shall be a vertical line of at least eight inches in length and the bottom of the mark shall be no less than three feet nor more than five feet high. Such paint marks shall be placed no more than 100 feet apart and shall be readily visible to any person approaching the property. Property so posted is to be considered posted for all purposes, and any unauthorized entry upon the property is trespass in the first degree, and a class B misdemeanor"".

Another important advantage of purple paint over posted signs is that it cannot be torn down. Also, as fast-growing trees pull the nails through the sign in 2 or 3 years, it loses hold and falls, requiring replacement. And, hunters won't be as tempted to shoot purple paint as they are to shoot signs.

To make the purple paint last longer, before painting a tree, scrape off the loose bark with a draw knife, taking care not to wound the tree. This process will at least double, if not triple the life of the paint mark, anywhere from 4 to 8 years! Smooth-barked trees, such as hickory are perfect to paint.

If you must put up a sign, be sure to nail it to a small, low-value tree of firewood quality. If you aren't sure which trees are low- value, be sure to contact your local consulting forester to assist you! Mistakes can be costly! Any butt log that is saved can mean financial benefit for landowners, loggers and foresters!",Green Horizons Newsletter
14,https://www.parents.com/health/parents-news-now/science-says-kids-shouldnt-cross-a-busy-street-solo-unitl-theyre-14/,"Kids younger than 14 can't always identify gaps in traffic that are large enough for them to cross safely, says a new study.

My kids are 14 and 11, and I'm not gonna lie—I HATE the idea of them crossing streets alone. They've both done it, just not with me because it makes me a nervous wreck. I call it ""street fear""—that moment when you're waiting to cross a busy street and finally decide to step out into a gap in traffic and bolt across. I'm 47 and my heart still races every time. Not as much as it did when I was younger, but enough that I still grasp tightly to both of my kids' hands.

Now science has just issued a pretty big strike against letting kids younger than 14 cross solo. According to a new study out of the University of Iowa, younger kiddos lack the perceptual judgment and physical skills needed to consistently get across safely.

""Some people think younger children may be able to perform like adults when crossing the street,"" said study author Jodie Plumert. ""Our study shows that's not necessarily the case on busy roads where traffic doesn't stop.""

While 14 may sound kind of old to some, when the researchers used a simulated setting to assess the ability of children ages 6 to 14 to cross one lane of a busy road, the younger children consistently had difficulty crossing safely, with accident rates as high as 8 percent among 6-year-olds. The 10-year-olds, meanwhile, were struck 5 percent of the time, and 12-year-olds, 2 percent of the time. Only the 14-year-old kids were able to consistently get across the lanes safely.

The big takeaway here for parents is to take extra precautions and recognize that your child may not be able to identify gaps in traffic that are large enough to cross safely. The researchers are now urging city planners to build more crosswalks near schools. But in the meantime, if your children have to cross the street without you, teach them to be patient and wait for bigger gaps in traffic.",Science Says Kids Shouldn't Cross a Busy Street Solo Until They're 14
No. ,https://lifehacker.com/should-you-slice-bagels-like-a-loaf-of-bread-1833606826,"In our latest edition of “Hack or Wack,” we’re taking a look at this viral tweet from a St. Louis native:

In the tweet, Krautmann asserts that he introduced his coworkers to this “St. Louis secret” of ordering bagels sliced into cross-sections like a loaf of bread.

Well. Maybe it should stay a secret.

If you are on the side of all that is good and true, you will note that this method results in many slices of irregular size, almost entirely eliminates the appeal of the bagel’s chewy outer crust, and results in sad little crostini that could be made out of any bread-like product.

Meanwhile, this G-d-forsaken “hack” has torn—or should I say sliced—our office apart. Some (wrong) members of the Lifehacker staff suggested that this idea is not a nightmarish hellscape, noting that this allows for smaller, easy-to-consume portions that will toast quickly and are more shareable.

But others have pointed out that smaller portions may result in over-consumption. You might eat 12 bagel/crostini/atrocities before realizing that’s equivalent to two full bagels. (In this writer’s humble opinion, I don’t know how anyone could down even one of these without their body rejecting it on sheer principle.)

This is certainly the worst bagel take since Cynthia Nixon’s lox-on-a-cinnamon-raisin-bagel scandal, (which I’m pretty sure cost her the election).

It’s also worth pointing out that the sad bagels in the photo are from Panera Bread, which add another unfortunate schmear of irony to this story: The billionaire owners of Panera (as well as Einstein Bagels and Krispy Kreme) recently came into the news when addressing the company’s Nazi past.

Of course, no religion or group of people owns this delicacy, and people may do with their baked goods as they wish. But as a New Yorker who attended a high school with a daily mid-morning snack time called “bagel break,” I find this concept offensive. The fact that it eliminates all texture that makes the bagel appealing is offensive. The fact that it comes from St. Louis is offensive. The fact that they ordered bagels from Panera is offensive. The fact that the person at Panera said “You want us to put bagels in the bread slicer? Okey dokey!” is offensive. This is the equivalent of a scoop of Temp Tee cream cheese thrown in your face, an egg cream poured over your head, and hot pastrami spilled all over the linoleum.

But “Us” is a little bit less straightforward than “Get Out” was, offering up what appears on the surface to be a fairly simple but ingenious twist on the home invasion formula — our protagonist family of four, led by Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke, is forced to face off against their own evil doppelgangers. But the further you get into the film, the clearer it becomes that there is so much more going on here than you could have imagined.

Britain’s oldest man revealed the secret to a long life today as he celebrated his 111th birthday..... with a pint of Stella and a whisky chaser.

Nazar Singh, born on June 8, 1904, has lived through two World Wars, the Titanic disaster, the first moon landing and the invention of colour television.

He grew up in Punjab, India, moved to England in 1965 and worked hard in a foundry, living in Walsall for almost 25 years before retiring to Sunderland in 1989.

He reckons his longevity is down to plenty of sleep, a healthy lifestyle.....and his favourite whisky tipple.

The centenarian has nine children, 34 grandchildren and 64 great-grandchildren and was married to his wife, Narajan Kaur, for 70 years before she died 12 years ago, aged 90.

He has never had an operation, retains some of his original teeth and has perfect hearing.

Mr Singh’s son, Chain Singh Gill, 62, said the secret to his father’s longevity is a healthy lifestyle and the odd glass of whisky.

He also revealed he likes to drink milk and almond oil, regularly eats fruit and sleeps for ten hours every night.

His family say he nearly died recently of an infection but pulled through and is currently seeing family in India - where he was pictured enjoying a Stella and a shot.

Mr Gill said: “We thought we had lost him because he had an infection but, thankfully, he is recovering now.

“It’s the care he gets and the food he eats that are most important. He doesn’t eat junk food and that’s what has kept him alive.

“I’m in contact with him, sometimes twice, every single day on the phone and he’s in good spirits.”

Mr Singh was raised in a village in Punjab and from the age of 10 helped his family to grow sugar cane, cotton, corn, wheat and later chilli, peanuts, potatoes and rice.

Born into a farming family, he always loved the outdoors and was a big fan of gardening - a hobby he refused to ditch until he turned 107.

Mr Singh met his wife, Narajan, in 1932 when he visited a nearby village and they were later wed in a traditional arranged marriage.

The 111-year-old had two sisters and four brothers who have all since passed away.

He returned to his native India at the beginning of the year to be with his family and is now being being cared for by his two eldest sons - the eldest of whom is 78 - and their wives.

Thought to be Britain’s oldest man, Mr Singh received a letter from the Queen on his 100th birthday and has been sent one every year since, along with an annual letter and phone call from the Department For Work and Pensions to see how he is.

In his lifetime, Mr Singh has witnessed the invention of the modern car, mobile phones, televisions, computers and the internet.

He has seen women get the right to vote, the fall of Nazi Germany, the beginning and end of Apartheid and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The oldest person believed to be alive today is 116-year-old Jeralean Talley, from the United States, who was born in 1899.

There are only two living men believed to be older than Mr Singh - Japanese Sakari Momori and Yasutaro Koide, who are both 112 and were born in 1903.",Britain's oldest man celebrates 111th birthday with a pint of Stella and a whisky chaser
Thieves will steal your car when you get out to examine the noise. ,https://en.newsner.com/family/warning-over-horrible-new-trick-if-you-see-a-plastic-bottle-on-your-tire-youre-at-risk/,"If there’s one thing the rise of social media has made infinitely better, it’s the ability for us to share warnings and advice with each other on an unprecedented scale.

One simple warning can now reach millions of people in a single day, which is in part the reason for this particular article.

Over the years there have been no end of tricks and sneaky tactics employed by people intent on scamming others.

Well, there’s now a new one to watch out for, if reports are to be believed. It involves a plastic water bottle, your car tire, and the potential theft of your car itself …

News agencies in multiple countries are covering this most dastardly of schemes, proving that it’s rapidly spreading around the world.

It was first reported in Limpopo, South Africa, but quickly spread online after a YouTube channel in Mexico issued a “warning” over criminals attempting to steal vehicles. Unfortunately, the video ended up doing harm as well as good, simultaneously teaching other would-be thugs how to swindle someone out of their car.

The scam goes like this: first, the criminals target a parked and unattended car, placing a water battle in the crevice between one of the tires and its wheel well. After the driver fails to spot the bottle, he or she will get in and start the engine.

No sooner have they got their vehicle moving than does the bottle crack and break as the tire goes round. This, of course, produces an alarming noise for the driver, who more often than not gets out of their car to inspect the noise.

Since they only expect to be out momentarily, it’s all too easy for said driver to leave the keys in the ignition, thus leaving the car at the mercy of anyone who wishes to jump in and drive away.

It’s as simple as that: driver gets out, driver gets distracted, thieves jump into car, car drives off. In some cases the criminals aren’t actually stealing the car, but rather valuable contents inside. Either way, the driver is robbed of something he or she has worked hard for …

Watch the video below to see a tutorial on the trick. It’s in Spanish, but the video itself tells all you need to know.

Though this horrible trick began half a world away, it’s spreading rapidly, and could all too easily end up on your very street. Please remember to always be vigilant when you suspect something might be wrong. Check your tire wells before getting into your car if you think for one moment that someone might have been messing with it.

Criminals can be crafty and clever – as has been proven in abundance throughout the course of history. Through transparency, vigilance, and communication we can foil them, however. No one deserves to fall victim to such a trick!

"""Fireman"" instead of ""Firefighter"" ",https://twentytwowords.com/peppa-pig-called-using-offensive-term/,"Kids’ TV shows are usually known for their innocuous drivel that helps keep children quiet for a couple of precious minutes. At best, they are educational, at worst they are hugely irritating.

But now, other things are being brought to people’s attention and it looks like they could be causing some pretty big problems. The main culprit is none other than the wildly popular Peppa Pig. Who knew that a kids’ TV show could cause such a fuss?

advertisement

What’s so great about Peppa Pig? Whether or not you have children, you will undoubtedly have heard of many children’s favorite TV character, Peppa Pig. As the name suggests, it follows the lives of a family of pigs. Our protagonist, Peppa, lives with her younger brother, George, and Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig.



advertisement

“The Peppa Pig Effect” is a real thing. Peppa Pig is a British TV show, so all the characters have quite posh English accents and American parents have recently started reporting that their children have taken up English accents as a result of watching too much Peppa Pig! Apparently, American children are starting to say things like ‘mum’ and ‘loo’. This is the ‘Peppa Pig Effect.’ But while this is hilarious, it’s not the main problem with the show.



advertisement

Peppa Pig has been in trouble before. There is an episode of Peppa Pig called ‘Mr Skinny Legs’. In the episode, Daddy Pig tells Peppa Pig that she doesn’t have to be afraid of spiders because they can’t hurt her. This is true in the UK, which means that arachnophobia, the fear of spiders, is usually considered to be an irrational fear. But that isn’t necessarily true everywhere in the world.



advertisement

Australia has had to ban the episode. While spiders aren’t dangerous in the UK, in Australia they pose a real threat. There are over 10,000 species of spider in Australia, and many of them are poisonous. An episode that encourages children to pick spiders up and throw them outside is teaching Australian children the wrong lesson. It could, in fact, be a very dangerous thing to do!



advertisement

What is the role of childrens’ TV shows? This is a really important question. Should kids’ TV just be about escapism and a moment of peace for parents, or should it offer something more? Does it matter what kids are watching or should a kids’ show just keep a child quiet?



advertisement

Kids are sponges. Young children are like sponges; they absorb everything they see. Their minds are still forming and they are learning from everything around them. For this reason, kids’ TV is actually very important. The hours spent watching these shows are hours spent learning from them.



advertisement

What kind of people do we want our children to be? For this reason, it’s important that we teach children to be open-minded and loving, that they understand that good behavior is important, from a young age. Many of childrens’ role models these days are characters in TV shows. Seeing what their favorite characters achieve inspires children to work hard do the same.



advertisement

Peppa Pig has quite a few controversial aspects. Before this latest uproar, one person had already called out Peppa Pig for a number of reasons, namely for fat-shaming. Okay so pigs are known for being fat, but it all gets a bit trickier when the pigs represent people, as they do in Peppa Pig.



advertisement

Is Peppa Pig a bad role model? Laughing at ‘Daddy Big Tummy’ encourages children to think they are allowed to laugh at people for being fat. Obviously, if this is carried into the real world, it becomes super uncool behavior. It would be better if characters, and therefore, children, could celebrate each other’s differences. Or at the very least, mention that people are all different sizes and that that’s okay.



advertisement

Were you influenced by a character as a child? Children are affected by their role models, whether they be toys or characters from TV shows, because it is only through seeing other people similar to yourself doing something, that you believe that you are capable of it too.

That’s why Barbie has realized it needs to diversify. Okay, so admittedly, in many ways, Barbie is the worst role model in the history of role models. Her name is synonymous with an unattainable standard of beauty that not even supermodels can hope to reach. But recently, her creators have realized that they need to join the rest of the world in being a little bit more woke and that they need to try to diversify, at least a little. Now, the Barbie figures come in 4 different body types and 7 hair colors. While it’s not exactly diverse, it’s a start.



advertisement

Barbie has had more career changes than most! Barbie is really excelling in terms of the different careers that she has had. So far she has had at least 130 different careers, ranging from astronaut to president. But the one that’s really got people talking is the Barbie Firefighter.



advertisement

Firefighters are very encouraging of Firefighter Barbie. Recently firefighters in the UK have been trying to tackle sexism that surrounds stereotypes in their profession. Namely, that they are all ‘firemen.’ This is obviously hugely disrespectful to all the women who are also firefighters, and it suggests to women everywhere that firefighting is not the profession for them.



advertisement

It is for this reason that the world is up in arms about Peppa Pig. In a shockingly unthinking display of sexism, Peppa Pig exclaims, “Mummy Pig is dressed as a fireman.” And no, it wasn’t a staged scene to explain to children that it is the wrong thing to say. It was scripted and aired; seems that no one on the Peppa Pig team thought anything of it.



advertisement

The public realized the ramifications immediately, though, and they were not happy. London Fire Brigade reacted and pointed out that they have not used the term ‘firemen’ for thirty years. So not only is the term sexist, but it’s also outdated. They highlight the fact that by using gender stereotypes, they are putting the idea in childrens’ heads that they can only do certain jobs.



advertisement

Some people didn’t see a problem with the scene. Piers Morgan, an English journalist who can be sure to point you in the right moral direction as he launches himself the other way, once again demonstrated his lack of ethics as he questioned the impact of blatant sexism. For some reason, he cannot see how this kind of language could dissuade young girls from potential careers in the future. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that he is a straight, white, cis-gendered, British male with all the privilege in the world. Maybe.



advertisement

Luckily, there are decent people in the world who are willing to challenge him. This twitter user highlights Morgan’s ignorance by pointing out the effect of these TV shows. It is at their young age that children need to see the options that are available to them in the future, and shouldn’t we be encouraging children to do anything that they want to do?



advertisement

Having daughters can make a huge difference. This man points out what many of us have witnessed first-hand: having daughters makes you re-evaluate your stance on sexism. This father has clearly seen the effect that a sexist world can have on his daughters and he’s not happy about it.



advertisement

“The Mighty Girl Effect” In fact, what this father described has a name. It is known as the ‘Mighty Girl Effect.’ It depicts research that shows that men who live with daughters gradually moderate their views on gender norms. There is even research that suggests that male CEOs with daughters are more likely than those without to take action in championing gender diversity in their work places.



advertisement

The London Fire Brigade knows what it’s talking about. Although some people might argue that shows like Fireman Sam have a female firefighter, and so that equates to gender equality, we’re on side with the LFB here. The involvement of one woman is completely undermined by the repeated use of the term ‘fireman’ rather than ‘firefighter.’



advertisement

Parents are starting to stand-up for their daughters’ futures. Hannah Summers sparked a huge reaction earlier this year when she tweeted about her daughter, Esme. Apparently, four year old Esme is already somewhat aware of the gender gap, and it is already affecting the choices that she will go on to make. If nothing else, hopefully, this will make it clear that we need to use the term ‘firefighters,’ rather than the gender specific term, ‘firemen’.



advertisement

Luckily, the world saw the tweet and wanted to help out. One branch of the London Fire Brigade saw Hannah’s tweet and sent a personal reply, just 9 hours later. Their tweet lets Esme know that she wouldn’t be alone if she wanted to be a firefighter; there’s loads of female firefighters out there!



advertisement

Other firefighters spoke out too. It’s awful to think that young children may already feel restricted about what they can do in their futures. Childhood is supposed to be a time of infinite dreams, not of gender restrictions. It is for this reason that so many firefighters are trying to demonstrate that gender is not important in the battle to save lives as firefighters. They are definitely living up to their chosen hashtag: #firefightingsexism.



advertisement

The battle against sexism is a global fight. Esme’s discovery of gender stereotypes at such a young age has crossed the Atlantic and reached all the way to Vancouver. Around the world, people are aware that there is a stigma around female firefighters that needs to be broken, so why didn’t the Peppa Pig team realize?



advertisement

Firefighters aren’t the only people who suffer from gender stereotypes. People were, understandably, outraged about this photo that went up recently of a young girl and boy. While some people were suggesting that the world was taking political correctness too far (something that is usually only claimed by people with privilege that they don’t want to concede to equality), other people saw this photo for what it was.



advertisement

Isn’t this all a bit of an over-reaction to kids’ stuff? The problem is that this is happening all the time and it’s so subtle that people think that it’s not a big deal. By using the word ‘fireman,’ rather than ‘firefighter,’ or by suggesting that girls will be nurses, rather than doctors, we are excluding young girls and women from certain occupations and that is undeniably wrong.



advertisement

Young girls are subtly being told that they will never make as much money as men. The sexism that is presented to young children at every turn is constantly reinforced by gender expectations. Girls are told that they should be beautiful, cute, or pretty, while boys are told that they need to be brave, strong, or clever. We start forming our ideas at a very young age, and these, in turn, influence our decision-making.



advertisement

There is no natural difference in interests between girls and boys at birth. It is not true that boys and girls are born with wildly different interests, which happen to mean that boys choose positions of authority that are paid more, while girls naturally choose roles with less prestige and less money. These are merely the gender roles that the world keep perpetuating. It is for this reason that people found the term ‘fireman’ offensive in Peppa Pig. So many children watch that show, and they were all told that being a firefighter is a male job and that is not okay.



advertisement

In some ways, Peppa Pig does provide positive role models. This Twitter user pointed out that the Peppa Pig books are full of female firefighters and it’s true; it’s great that Peppa Pig is showing women in these roles! But language is an incredibly important way in which we form our ideas and our identities. We need to speak in a way that reflects the society that we want to be a part of, rather than just copying the way things used to be said in the past.



advertisement

Hopefully other shows will learn from this mistake. Ultimately, this was an unfortunate moment of insensitivity but it shows a lack of understanding that, in many ways, belittles both the hard work of firefighters, as well as the battle against sexism. Hopefully, the fact that everyone has noticed, and has rightfully criticised, this insensitivity, will prevent other shows from making the same mistakes. In turn, this should lead to a well-balanced and just society that promotes equal opportunities for everyone, regardless of gender or any other factor.

",Peppa Pig Has Been Called out for Using Offensive Term
Malaysia. ,https://blog.theanimalrescuesite.greatergood.com/cat-burglar-steals-shoes/,"Like many cats, Jordan, a long-haired cat from Pennsylvania, loves to shower his favorite human with presents. These gifts used to include mice, birds, snakes, and other typical feline prey, as well as the occasional piece of litter. But one day, the black-and-white cat suddenly turned his attentions toward a more unusual target: shoes.

At first, Jordan’s owner threw away the odd shoes that randomly appeared in his yard. But when the cat’s collection of pilfered footwear started piling up, owner BJ Ross created a Facebook page to help neighbors reclaim their stolen loot.

“If y’all know my cat Jordan, y’all know he loves to bring me home shoes!!!!!” Ross wrote in the public group, Jordan The Feline Cat Burglar, which quickly ballooned to include thousands of members. “This tiny little cat drags me home one, two, three shoes. Every night!!”

Most members aren’t actually victims of Jordan’s thievery but have tuned in to follow this adorable feline felon, whose illicit stash already includes 50 shoes – and counting. This startling intake led Ross to outfit his cat — who has been repeatedly caught on the security camera — with a GPS tracking collar to see how Jordan manages to collect so many shoes.

According to Jordan’s tracking device, this committed cat burglar maintains a large territory that encompasses multiple visits to houses throughout the neighborhood. This is likely because Jordan likes to present his owner with complete pairs, but — being a cat – can only carry one shoe at a time. A lesser cat burglar might find this limiting, but Jordan prepares for his nightly misadventures with lots of proactive napping.

Regardless, most people on Jordan’s Facebook page are endeared by the cat’s penchant for human footwear, which has inspired hundreds of comments and adoring fans on Facebook. “It kills that he goes back and gets the other shoe to make a pair smart kitty,” one Facebook user wrote. Another woman confided that her young daughter “thinks Jordan is “so cool” and insisted on leaving her sister’s shoes out for him.”

It’s unclear if Jordan’s victims are equally entertained by the cat’s thievery, but Jordan’s owner is happy to make returns if somebody recognizes their shoes and messages him directly.

Well, here’s something new to get all steamed up about.

A Reddit user recently posted a seemingly innocent question to the subreddit Too Afraid To Ask, and it blew up into one of the greatest debates of our time: “How many ‘chuggas’ are you supposed to say before ‘choo choo’”?

“I’ve always said two, but now my kid is saying three,” a user called u/baption0 wrote. “However, my kid’s preschool teacher says one and it pisses me off that there aren’t enough chuggas for a choo; how’s the train supposed to go anywhere?”

The question immediately sparked some pretty fervent responses.

One of the most popular comments cited the importance of the “Batman” theme song in this particular situation.

“My rules is the same number of chuggas as we do for the Batman cartoon theme song,” Reddit user deadfermata wrote. “Na na na na na na na na na na na na BATMAN!”

Soon after this comment was made, the consensus seemed to be that eight was the optimal number of chuggas for perfect chugga/choo-choo proportions.

Reddit

Others felt that eight chuggas was way too many and, for the sake of brevity, four was sufficient:

In your thirties. ,https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/the-latest-research-suggests-we-dont-really-become-adults-until-our-thirties/,"What makes an adult an adult?

Is there a pre-defined age? Say, when you turn 18 and are officially ""legal"". Or can you only pass after you've checked off a certain number of pre-selected rites of passage? The mortgage, the marriage, the 9-to-5 job, 2.5 kids, Volvo Hatchback, and white picket fence, etcetera.

Well, science has an answer and the truth appears to be less clear cut. The latest research seems to suggest that we don't become fully formed adults until we reach our thirties – though as with puberty, wisdom teeth, and losing our virginity, the exact age varies from person to person.

The reason scientists have identified our thirties as the entry point to adulthood is due to the extent of changes, particularly in the brain, that takes place in our late teens and throughout our twenties. For example, our neurons continue to develop, connect, and become more refined in our third decade, even if the bulk of the change took place in our mid-teens. (And it can continue to change well past our thirtieth birthday.)

These changes can affect our behavior and even our propensity to develop mental health conditions like schizophrenia. To take the example of schizophrenia, the average age of onset is late teens to early twenties in men and late twenties to early thirties in women.

""What we're really saying is that to have a definition of when you move from childhood to adulthood looks increasingly absurd,"" Peter Jones, a professor of neuroscience from Cambridge University, told reporters at the Academy of Medical Sciences in Oxford, UK.

""It's a much more nuanced transition that takes place over three decades.""

This idea that childhood stops at 18 has been gaining a lot of traction recently, with an article published in the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal just last year arguing that the period of life we call adolescence lasts much longer than most of us realize.

The term ""adolescence"" was first described in a 1904 paper published by the psychologist G. Stanley Hall called ""Adolescence"". She defined the word as ""the phase of life stretching between childhood and adulthood"". Most of us associate this phase with the teen years but it can start as young as 10, researchers say, when some girls start to hit puberty.

It continues, they explain, ""well into the twenties"" as the body and brain continues to develop and socio-economic forces (think: the rising cost of housing, an unstable job market, and student debts) delay the traditional signposts of adulthood (partnering, parenting, and economic independence) and extend the period of ""semi-dependency"" that is adolescence.

Similarly, recent neuroscience research suggests putting a timestamp on adulthood (18 years plus) is an old-fashioned way of looking at things.

""There isn’t a childhood and then an adulthood,"" Jones explained. ""People are on a pathway, they’re on a trajectory.""",Scientists Suggest The Age When You Really Become An Adult
Like chicken. ,https://www.cnet.com/science/lab-grown-cultured-clean-meat-tasting-the-chicken-of-the-future-just-inc/,"Chicken nuggets usually get a pretty bad rap. Whether they're filled with mystery meat or come with a mouthful of additives, they also involve slaughtering an animal. But the nugget I'm about to eat from San Francisco-based Just was grown in a lab, using cells taken from a living chicken. It's cultured meat (and cruelty-free).

Carnivores, breathe a sigh of relief.

Now playing: Watch this: Trying a lab-grown chicken nugget

Unlike entirely plant-based products such as the Impossible Burger, the Just chicken nugget is actual meat.

Cultured meat, also called lab-grown or clean meat, starts with the collection of cells, usually done through a biopsy so the animals aren't harmed. Just says it has also been able to get cells from a chicken feather. The most viable cells are chosen and then given the right nutrients they need to grow in a bioreactor. In the case of this chicken nugget, those nutrients are plant-based.

Not only does cultured meat avoid sacrificing animals, it could take fewer resources to produce than traditional livestock. Around 14.5 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are from livestock, according to a report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. But one study questions how environmentally friendly clean meat products could be if the process is energy-intensive.

CNET

Just's cultured chicken product takes around two weeks to grow in a bioreactor. The team of chefs plays a major part in creating the product once the scientists have developed the biology. ""They are really the ones that can assemble everything and come up with the ideal ratios of cell types,"" says Vitor Santo, director of cellular agriculture.

So what does it actually taste like? The crunch from the breading and the smell from the fry was exactly what I expected from a good chicken nugget. But I was pleasantly surprised at how similar the cultured chicken itself tasted compared to the real deal, even if it didn't look like your typical KFC or McDonald's nugget. You can watch the video to find out more.

Just's next cultured meat product will be wagyu beef. Several other companies are also developing clean meat derived from animal cells, like Memphis Meats (chicken and duck) and SuperMeat (also chicken).

If you're hankering to try your own cultured chicken nugget, you'll have to hold tight a little longer. The nugget needs to get USDA and FDA approval in the US, but Just says it'll first be available in selected high-end restaurants in Asia later this year once it gets regulatory approval.

marigold-y/Shutterstock

There are a surprising amount of activities you can’t do until you reach a certain age, like drive a car and rent a hotel room. On the flip side, you apparently can become too old to do certain things, too. That includes one rather commonplace habit: wearing jeans.

Bitter? You should take it up with a new study by UK-based delivery service CollectPlus. Their survey asked 2,000 Brits to share their shopping habits and wardrobe preferences—all the way down to their perfect pair of jeans.

Based on the final data, the researchers recommend ditching denim by the time you reach 53 years old. It’s not because you’re making a fashion faux pas, though. In truth, it just becomes harder to find a pair that fits by that age.

Sadly, the numbers spell bad news for denim devotees. One in 10 of respondents over the age of 50 reported trying on up to six styles before finding the perfect pair, the researchers said. The study also found that most people experience peak stress levels while jeans shopping by age 53. Six percent of shoppers even became so upset they burst into tears. (Sound familiar? Here’s how to find the best jeans for your body type.)

Of course, finding the perfect pair of blue jeans might as well be rocket science, no matter how old you are. In fact, research shows people spend an average of five to eight days searching for jeans. So it’s no surprise that most people don’t buy a new pair for another three years at minimum.

If you still want to rock your favorite pair of denims until you retire, we will cheer you on. But regardless of your age, you’ll want to steal these tricks to make cheap jeans look expensive.

Front to back. ,https://lifehacker.com/how-to-correctly-wipe-your-butt-5805108,"Wiping your butt after using the toilet is one of those things most of us don’t think about on a regular basis—we just do it and get on with our day. But are you wiping correctly? Does it even matter? Lifehacker spoke with a few doctors to get to the bottom of the matter.

How it’s done now

From what I gather, the two major schools of wiping are front-to-back, with your arm reaching behind you from the side, or back-to-front, with your arm between your legs. There’s also another method, where it’s not exactly front-to-back/back-to-front, but more of a swirling motion, as if you were cleaning a dirty spot on a window. I’ve never actually seen this in practice, but to be fair, the number of times I’ve witnessed any of these methods executed by someone else can be counted on one hand. (And I washed that hand afterwards.)

The right way

The method of wiping your buttocks depends on what kind of equipment you have in the area. If you have a penis, dermatologist Curtis Asbury, M.D. says to “do whatever feels right. It makes no difference. Heck, you can go side to side if you like!”

But on the other hand, people with a vagina and vulva are definitely going to want to wipe front-to-back. Brian Bowes, M.D., an internal medicine physician explains why direction is so important for this part of the population:

The majority of cases of cystitis or urethritis are from E. coli, the normal flora that lives in your gastrointestinal tract. This helps you digest your food, but if you wipe from back to front you risk smearing it to your urethral meatus (pee hole). Then the bacteria get into a sterile environment [your pee hole] and cause a UTI. This was traditionally taught in medical school to be “honeymoon cystitis” as many women would get UTIs after their vigorous honeymoon weekend and come back with this normal infection.

Are Vaginal Probiotics Necessary? Probiotics have been one of the buzziest health trends of the past decade—though they’ve actually… Read more

As for people with a penis, Bowes has some thoughts on that, too:

...most have at least 6 inches (hopefully) between their anus and urethral meatus (opening at the end of their penis)...this protects them from urinary tract infections. Therefore anyone with a penis that they pee out of (not to exclude any sexes) is protected from E. coli and may feel free to wipe in whichever way that pleases them (not that it should be pleasurable).

Advertisement

So what about the science? One 2009 study of wiping after passing urine, showed a small increase in infection when wiping back-to-front. However, another study on college-age women with UTIs showed that there was no increase. Though there’s not a ton of research conducted specifically on the effects of different wiping methods, the professional medical consensus is clear: people with vaginas should definitely wipe front-to-back. In fact, the Mayo Clinic, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the Cleveland Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco all note on their websites recommend front-to-back wiping for people with a vagina in order to prevent urinary tract infections.

And while we’re on the subject of wiping, what about those pre-moistened wipes that are popular but terrible for the environment? Asbury says that not only do you not need them, but they can also cause an allergic reaction:

Recent attempts at ultra-cleanliness have lead to a trend of using moist wipes rather than dry toilet paper to wipe. The main problem with this is the growing sensitivity to chemicals in the moist wipes. An allergy to these chemicals can cause pain, irritation, and redness which often causes the person to use the wipes more, and thus perpetuating the problem. The main chemical associated with moist wipe allergy is methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI or Kathon CG) although other common allergens in wipes include quaternium-15, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM hydantoin and fragrances. Use moist wipes at your own risk, and at the very least, read the label!

Alternatives to wiping

So if there’s no reason to use moist chemical wipes, is there anything better than the traditional two-ply? If you guessed bidets, you’d be right, and you’ve probably used one before. But Chris Lowry, M.D., a physician and the director of MedRevise.co.uk, points out something interesting about long-term usage that I’ve never heard before.

Japanese toilets often contain a water jet and blow dryer that cleans the anus for you. Apparently, some Japanese doctors are now claiming to be seeing cases of “Washlet Syndrome” where cleaning that is too effective leads to problems such as weak sphincter muscles, dry skin and anal sores.

If you’re a DIY-er, you might be wondering what other things you can wipe with. Lowry recalls stories of a man who experimented on himself with such items as dried corncob, rocks, newspaper, leaves, and vinegar on a sponge. Ultimately, he found that while many of these methods do work in an emergency situation, that modern toilet paper is definitely your best bet.

Alternatives to traditional toilets

Pulling back one level from wiping, Lowry points out that squat toilets—the type you see in some Asian countries, might be healthier. But this could be also attributed to a high-fiber diet, rather than the method of evacuation. Also, as we poin ted out in a previous post, sitting in a squat position may help move things along, but there’s no evidence that it actually improves your overall health. And regardless of whether you sit or squat, you’re still going to have to wipe, so it doesn’t really change anything in that department.

To reduce environmental impact. ,https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/lifestyle-buzz/why-straws-are-banned-from-buckingham-palace/ar-BB1g77hv,"© Tatiana Ayazo/Rd.com,shutterstock

It all started with a movie. Queen Elizabeth II worked with Sir David Attenborough on a documentary about creating forested parks in the Commonwealth in conservation efforts, and rumor has it the film sparked Her Majesty’s interest in going green.

Almost 300 million tons of plastic are produced every year, but they take more than 400 years to biodegrade. Over the last 60 years, only 9 percent of plastics has been recycled, while 79 percent—5.5 billion tons—is sitting in landfills or littering the environment.

In an effort to cut plastic waste, the Queen is taking matters into her own hands with some new house rules. “Across the organization, the Royal Household is committed to reducing its environmental impact,” a Buckingham Palace spokesman told the Telegraph. “As part of that, we have taken a number of practical steps to cut back on the use of plastics.” Guess that's just one more thing to add to these 15 surprisingly frugal habits of the royal family.

The royals aren’t just talking the talk, either. Staff aren’t allowed to use straws in dining rooms anymore, and straws are being phased out from public cafes such as Buckingham Palace’s Garden Café. Meanwhile, caterers at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and Edinburgh’s Holyrood Palace will be swapping out single-use dishes for china plates, and glasses or recyclable paper cups for plastic bottles. Royal Collection cafes will still have takeout options, but the containers will be biodegradable or compostable—no plastics to be found. “At all levels, there's a strong desire to tackle this issue,” the spokesman said. To follow Queen Elizabeth's lead, try these 12 simple ways to reduce waste every day.

Shamrocks have 3 leaves. ,"https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/difference-between-shamrock-and-four-leaf-clover/#:~:text=The%20Science&text=You%20can%20easily%20spot%20the,find%20a%20four%2Dleaf%20clover.","Le Panda/Shutterstock

Shamrocks have been a national symbol of Ireland for centuries and while every March 17th, St. Patrick’s Day revelers in the U.S. dress up in their green garb to watch parades and sip green drinks, too often they’re donning four-leaf clovers instead of shamrocks. We want to clear up any confusion about the difference between the two so you can celebrate the holiday accurately!

The History and The Legend

The old tale goes like this: St. Patrick used the abundant shamrock of the Emerald Isle to explain the holy trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) in his work to convert Irish people to Christianity. And, even before St. Patrick popularized the shamrock (or, some would say that later writers and botanists popularized the tale of St. Patrick and the shamrocks), Druids used them for medicinal purposes. No matter how you look at the history, shamrocks have been a core part of Irish history and heritage for centuries and will remain a popular symbol for the foreseeable future. A four-leaf clover, on the other hand, is considered a good-luck token simply because it’s such a rare find. In some narratives, it’s the leaf of luck while the other three symbolize faith, hope and love. So, to be clear, the difference between a shamrock and four-leaf clover: the four-leaf clover is a charm of luck any time of year but it is not representative of Irish tradition and St. Patrick’s Day. For the Irish, it’s all about the shamrocks!

If you’re interested in good luck plants, then add one of these 12 to your home!

Make your garden pop this year with one of these 10 inexpensive plants.

The Science

Shamrock, or “seamrag” in Gaelic, means “little clover” which is so fitting because shamrocks and flour-leaf clovers belong to the white clover plant family (although there is debate in the botanist community about which plant family shamrocks truly belong to.) You can easily spot the difference between the two because shamrocks have three leaves (or leaflets, technically) while four-leaf clovers have, obviously, four leaflets. It takes a rare genetic mutation to get that extra leaf which is why it’s so difficult to find a four-leaf clover. Research places the difficulty at 1/10,000, so if you’re trying to find one of your own, you’re going to need to scan an area of about 1.2m² (roughly the size of an office desk) according to Scientific American’s editor Eric R. Olson. Good luck!

That model has since been grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as by aviation regulators around the world.

Still, if you invested in Boeing 10 years ago, that decision would have paid off: According to CNBC calculations, a $1,000 investment in 2009 would be worth more than $14,000 as of March 15, 2019, a total return over 1,000 percent. In the same time frame, by comparison, the S&P 500 was up 270 percent.

Any individual stock can over- or under-perform, however, and past returns do not predict future results. Boeing paused delivery of 737 Max planes after the Ethiopia crash, which came less than five months after another deadly crash in Indonesia involving the same model.

This left several major airlines, including United, American and Southwest scrambling to rebook passengers and reassign planes. Those companies said they would waive ticket-change fees and fare differences for those affected by the FAA's grounding order.

Flight-booking site Kayak even introduced a new search feature that allows users to exclude specific plane models, according to co-founder and chief executive officer Steve Hafner.

CNBC: Boeing stock as of Mar. 15, 2019

Fortunately for Boeing, while shares plunged more than 10 percent early this week, they ticked back up by as much as 3 percent Friday. And the company announced plans to roll out a software fix in the next few weeks.

Though, Bank of America analyst Ronald Epstein said Thursday that the fix could take a lot longer: ""Once Boeing identifies the issue … the most likely scenario is the company will take about 3-6 months to come up with and certify the fix,"" he said in a note.

Hafner says he expects the 737 Max models to be grounded only a few months and that travelers will likely be booking flights on them again soon: ""They're out of service on a temporary basis,"" he said on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley."" ""In reality, airlines are still planning on flying those planes in the summer. People want security and comfort when they fly.""

In the meantime, Boeing said in a statement it will ""continue to build 737 Max airplanes, while assessing how the situation, including potential capacity constraints, will impact our production system.""","If you invested $1,000 in Boeing 10 years ago, here's how much you'd have now"
You must walk briskly. ,https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Can-You-Lose-Weight-Walking-Hour-Day-45792193,"If you're on a mission to lose weight but don't have the time or energy for a more intense workout, walking is a great place to start. And with fitness trackers and GPS apps readily available on our phones, it's easier than ever to track your steps, time, or distance whenever you hit the pavement.

So, let's say you walk for an hour during the day: will you lose weight? One study in JAMA Internal Medicine showed that subjects who, without making changes to their diet, worked out at a rate equivalent to walking 12 miles per week for eight months saw fat loss. The authors further stated that the controls in this experiment gained weight, but that could be reversed with 30 minutes of daily walking.

Plus, exercise physiologist Tom Holland, MS, CSCS, told POPSUGAR in a previous interview that you can certainly see weight-loss results by walking just 30 minutes per day. He recommends that true beginners start with walking three to four times per week, then increase from there. But, just how effective your workout is depends on a number of factors.

""The intensity at which you walk plays a key role in helping your body burn more calories and improve your cardiorespiratory system,"" Denise Miklasz, an ACE-certified personal trainer at Northwestern Medicine Crystal Lake Health & Fitness Center, told POPSUGAR.

If you're walking at a casual stroll, you're probably not going to achieve the weight loss you want. One way to pick up the pace? ""You could include 30- to 60-second bursts of faster walking every three to five minutes, followed by a 30-second recovery walk,"" Miklasz said. You can also try walking with weights or picking a route with hills to add some intervals to your workout.

""An interval-training workout will continue to burn more calories after your workout due to a physiological effect called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, or EPOC. EPOC is sometimes referred to as the 'afterburn effect,'"" Miklasz explained.

Even more important is your diet. You know this, but you can't eat whatever you want or as much as you want the second you start exercising. ""In order to lose weight you need to create a calorie deficit,"" Miklasz said. One pound is equal to 3,500 calories, so you'd need to carve out 3,500 calories each week in order to lose one pound, which experts consider a safe and healthy goal. In other words, ""you need to either burn an extra 3,500 calories or remove 3,500 calories from your diet,"" Miklasz explained — or a combination of the two.

""Combining exercise with a healthy diet is more effective than restricting calories alone. Exercise can help you maintain and increase lean body mass, which results in a larger calorie burn per day,"" Miklasz said. To that point, when you're ready to start building muscle, remember that walking alone won't cut it. She noted, ""Ideally, incorporating strength training along with aerobic exercise will increase muscle mass and boost your metabolism.""

For reasons that were, no doubt, well intentioned, an Atlanta-based company called SalesLoft -- which offers, oh dear lord, ""sales management solutions"" -- decided to ""deconstruct"" millions of emails to see whether some content was more effective than ""Hi, I hope you're well.""

I can't imagine how you deconstruct an email. Probably in the same way a fancy chef deconstructs peach flambé.

Oddly, this deconstructive study insisted that any numbers in a subject line reduced the response rate by 32 percent.

Even more oddly, emails containing the word ""referred"" in their subject line enjoy a 536 percent greater response rate.

Emails with fewer than 50 words apparently showed a response rate 40 percent greater than average.

Perhaps you're already moved by some of this blinding fascination.

I, though, am still bathing in another result from the study.

It seems that if you write ""Cheers"" as your sign-off, it increases the response rate by 8 percent.

It's so very British, after all.

Sadly, I'm not that sort of British. Indeed, my blood is Polish and it boils every time I see someone shove this word in, perhaps in an attempt at peculiar assimilation.

Naturally, I asked SalesLoft whether, perhaps, it had deconstructed a vast trove of British emails.

The company told me that the data was representative of its client base, which is predominantly American.

There must be quite a few Americans who believe talking British -- rather than ending an email with, say, ""Thanks"" -- will get them somewhere.

Ultimately, though, I can now feel more sanguine.

No. Pimple popping? No. Absolutely not. But I’m proud of the fact that it has become this. I came upon it by accident but I grew it, I saw the opportunity and said, “What can we do?” I just never imagined it would be something so crazy like this.

What is it about pimple popping that you think fascinates and intrigues people so much?

It really pulls on emotions for people. It’s so interesting because something that is based on something gross and shocking actually makes people happy. It relaxes them, it decreases their anxiety, it’s thrilling. And when people like it, they don’t just like it ― they’re obsessed.

Myself included. There’s something so satisfying about it.

That’s really how it grew ― it created this reaction. If it created distaste or people really loved it, either way they would tag their friends and that’s how it grew so quickly.

Has doing your job changed since becoming a viral sensation and launching your reality show?

Dermatology is very competitive to get into because of the lifestyle. You definitely deal with complicated issues, but you don’t often deal with life-threatening ones, nor do you get calls in the middle of the night. It’s a lower-stress kind of specialty medicine, but this has definitely upped it a notch.

How so?

Before, I maybe removed 10 cysts in a year. Now it’s like 10 within a few days. It’s changed the things that I do, and the show has changed it to a different level too where we’re moving much bigger things on a regular basis. It’s challenged me, but I feel a sense of accomplishment and it’s made me proud to represent dermatology.

You don’t realize how much is involved with the show: the whole [office] kind of was torn apart and changed. We had to change the color of the rooms. [The crew is] really careful and considerate, but there are just a lot more people walking around now. I have to make sure my patients aren’t upset or affected.

Was there ever a time you thought about ending the show because of that?

The first season I was not having a good time. It was a really big deal for me to do it in the first place because I knew it meant giving up control. On YouTube and social media, I get to decide what’s on there, so to give the control to someone else was really hard. It was also extremely stressful for me because the most important thing to me is the patients and how they do and that I’m giving them the best care possible. I know ultimately the show cares about entertainment. They care about me and the patient of course, but not the same way I do. So it was really stressful. It was an adjustment, but I’m really proud of the show. I’m learning to enjoy it more now.

How has fame affected your personal life?

It’s awkward for me and it’s hard to get my mind around. I’m so aware that I don’t want to come off as not being the person I am on my show because I feel I am that person, but I’m also shy! I don’t feel like I deserve this adulation or reaction from people when they come up to me and say such nice things. I’m not the kind of person who says, “Oh, thank you, yes, that’s me,” and so I feel like maybe I come off as cold or not friendly. I’m trying to work on it. I say “thank you” and take a photo. I try to do that, but it’s uncomfortable.

Even when that person, say, asks for an impromptu skin check on the street?

People did that before the show too. It’s just part of what you do. Usually if I’m with someone and they ask, I answer them ― what are you going to say, no? But sometimes it’s awkward if they want to show me a body part that’s under their clothes, and you know, technically you shouldn’t make a diagnosis like that [on the street]. It’s a liability.

I’ve found that no matter what your profession is, everyone wants something.

Plumbers, electricians, lawyers ― everyone wants advice. My husband and I were on a cruise early on in our marriage and were set up with another couple for dinner. On the way to the first dinner my husband said, “You know what? Let’s not tell them we’re dermatologists.” I was like, “We can’t do that! We’re sitting next to them ― we’re gonna talk to them every day.” Then I said, “Maybe we should just say we’re in the XXX industry, something that will make them be quiet,” but then I thought if they were in that industry we would get caught in a lie [laughs].

We finally made a deal that I would take one for the team and say I’m the dermatologist and my husband is the office manager. Now that’s what we say every time we go somewhere.

You (and your millions of fans) say that watching popping videos actually relieves anxiety and relaxes people. But what do you watch to relax?

Mukbangs! I’m just amazed at how much food they’re eating and that they’re making money off this on camera, just talking about their lives and eating a huge vat of noodles. It’s crazy.

OK ― last thing I have to ask. Are you ever grossed out by anything you see at work?

No, but the funny thing is that it doesn’t mean things don’t gross me out. I’m plenty grossed out by other bodily functions ― diarrhea, vomit. I’m more grossed out by like, feet, than cysts and things.",Here's The Thing That Grosses Dr. Pimple Popper Sandra Lee Out More Than Cysts
He's not using a case and got micro-scratches on it. ,https://gizmodo.com/why-i-regret-upgrading-to-an-iphone-xs-1832653430,"I’ve had my iPhone XS for a little over three months, and it’s driving me crazy. Not the whole thing. The phone is beautiful, fast, a joy to use. What’s driving me crazy is an increasingly complex network of scratches on the display glass. The first ones were small, almost unnoticeable at a glance. Then, about six weeks after I spent well over $1,000 upgrading to the iPhone XS, a ribbon-shaped abrasion appeared on the screen and then another. The worst part is that Apple is pitching a fit about fixing it.

Before you cast too many judgments, let me own up to a few facts about how I treat my phone. I don’t use a case. I never lay it face-down on a surface. Frankly, I baby the thing, because it costs as much as a cheap used car, and I’m an unusually anxious person who can’t stand the sight of the smallest ding or crack.

That was the crux of a post I wrote last year, after noticing how easily the iPhone X screen developed scratches. But the iPhone XS was supposed to be better, more durable. Apple said it had the “most durable glass ever on a smartphone.” Apple said that about the iPhone X, too, although the company has never fully explained what that claim means. I can’t imagine it means that the new glass is more scratch resistant than what’s been on earlier iPhones, because I’ve never had so many issues with surface scratches as I had on my iPhone X and, now, my iPhone XS.

In retrospect, I never should have upgraded. My iPhone XS review actually made it pretty clear that the X-to-XS jump didn’t make much sense because the new iPhone is almost identical to its older sibling except for the new phone’s beefier processor, better cameras, improved antennas, and according to Apple, more durable glass. Plus, all these new iPhones are built to be more future proof than any iPhone ever. The glass thing hooked me, though. I’d cracked the back glass on my iPhone X, and while that could be repaired, I figured more cracks were inevitable. Plus, having very publicly complained about the scratch-prone screen on the iPhone X, I figured the slightly better performance coupled with the improved durability would make sense for what I wanted to do: buy one iPhone and keep it for four or five years.

The other thing that hooked me was the Apple Upgrade Program, which I joined in 2016. The program lets you get a new iPhone through an interest-free loan that you pay down in 24 monthly installments, which include the cover the cost of the device as well as AppleCare. After a year, you can trade in your device for a new iPhone. If you don’t want to upgrade, you just pay off the loan in two years, at which point, the iPhone is yours free and clear. So when the iPhone XS came out, I was faced with the option of keeping my iPhone X, paying down the loan for another 12 months, or I could upgrade to the iPhone XS, start a new loan, and end up owning a better device after another two years.

This doesn’t mean that you can upgrade for free. For one, upgrading means you lose all the equity you built up on the one phone. I used to own half of an iPhone X. I essentially traded that in for the privilege of getting an iPhone XS. On top of that, I had to pay sales tax and an upgrade fee to Verizon. I also had to pay a $100 incident fee for the crack on the back of my iPhone X, which was a bit of a surprise, since I figured AppleCare would cover a single crack. So although my monthly payment remained when I got the new one, the upgrade ended up costing me a few hundred dollars in the grand scheme of things.

And then I got these scratches! It’s hard for me not to sound like a brat, since screen scratches can be easily avoided by using a screen protector and a case. The fact of the matter is, no matter how much anyone babies their phone, glass is bound to scratch. I guess I just sort of hoped I could enjoy a pristine screen for more than a month before my expensive new iPhone XS developed a whole network of them—just like my iPhone X had.

Unfortunately for me, AppleCare can’t solve my scratch problem. In multiple conversations with both Genius Bar employees and Apple Support, I was told that surface scratches were treated as cosmetic damage and were not covered. One Apple employee slyly suggested that if my screen somehow developed a crack in it, I could get the entire display replaced for just $30. If I just wanted to replace the display as it was, scratches and all, Apple would charge me $280. And replacing the display would be the only way to rid myself of the scratches. There was no magical buffing machine in the back of the Apple Store and no way to replace the glass itself.

I seriously considered taking a hammer to the screen. Just one crack and I’d get a brand new flawless screen for the price of a pizza dinner. Here at Gizmodo, however, we do not encourage or condone the destruction of gadgets for personal gain. Plus, it’s a pretty daft idea to break an iPhone on purpose.

So I’m stuck with the iPhone XS, and I’m stuck with the scratches. And because the screen is scratched, I feel very pessimistic about the resale value. This makes me want to double down on my initial ambition to keep the phone for five years. And if I want to avoid any more dumb damage, I’d have to get a case. After years of gleefully flitting through life with a naked iPhone, I must finally become a case person.

There are a million options for iPhone cases, and I tried a range. I tested a goofy leather case that makes your phone look like the classic Adidas Samba soccer shoe. I spent time with the latest $100 Mophie charging case which made my phone feel like a dull brick. I also tried both of the Apple-branded iPhone XS cases, and using those helped me realize that I wanted a case that would be as minimal as possible.

So my main goal became finding a case that left the iPhone XS feeling as close to case-free as possible. Maybe unsurprisingly, the Apple-made cases almost did it for me. Both the leather and silicone versions fit snuggly enough to slide into my jeans pocket easily, and I like that they have raised buttons for volume control and power. What I really don’t like about the Apple cases as well as a lot of other third-party cases was the extent to which the sides of the case create little ridges around the phone screen. So when I swipe across it, I end up bumping into these instead of smoothly sliding off the edge in the pleasing, slalom-like fashion you get with a case-free iPhone.

I ultimately settled on a company called Peel. “Case” is almost too big a word to describe what Peel makes. They’re basically super-thin plastic skins that snap on to your phone and provide the slightest amount of protection. Peel also makes a low-profile glass screen protector that successfully hid my scratches, when I installed it. The Peel case costs $30, as does the glass screen protector. So for the $60, I had a somewhat protected iPhone XS and newly scratch-free screen. Which is a heck of a lot cheaper than the $280 screen replacement that Apple wanted me to get. For reference, the cheaper silicone case made by Apple costs $40, and the Belkin InvisiGlass Ultra screen protector that Apple will install in their stores using special machines costs $40.

Now that it’s safely wrapped in a minimalist case and sealed with a glass screen protector, my iPhone XS sort of feels new again. It also reminds me that my iPhone X would have felt exactly the same in the same $60 skin. Yes, the iPhone XS has a better processor, though I don’t think anything I do with it requires as much power as it offers. Yes, the XS camera is slightly better, though I don’t even notice the difference when taking pictures of my dog (which is mostly what I use the camera for). Yes, Face ID is a fraction of a second faster. But unfortunately, the iPhone XS just didn’t end up being as durable as I thought it would be. It definitely doesn’t feel more durable than my iPhone X did.

Looking back at my decision to upgrade, I realize that regret was inevitable. On a practical level, it was a cavalier thing to do. I didn’t need a new iPhone. The one I had was banged up, sure, but it worked just fine. I wanted a new phone, though, and Apple made it so easy to take the leap that I shuffled the sketchy economics of upgrading into the back of my head, letting the promises of Apple’s marketing team hold my attention.

I should have known better. Even if my iPhone XS were still in mint condition, I think I’d be second-guessing my decision at this point. Unlike my last upgrade from an iPhone 7 to an iPhone X, my life did not meaningfully improve when I got the iPhone XS. The fact that it got banged up so quickly, too—well, that makes me regret the regrettable decision to upgrade even more.

It’s not the end of the world. I spent money I could have saved, but I do hope this extended, hand-wringing confessional might be helpful to any iPhone X owners who might be considering bumping up to the newest model. Then again, Apple will be announcing another new iPhone in six months. And then another one a year after that. You don’t need to buy any of them, and I hope I don’t. At least, not until this scratched up iPhone XS sees its fifth birthday. Then, maybe it will be worth it.",Why I Regret Upgrading to an iPhone XS
60 seconds. ,https://www.thehealthy.com/exercise/how-long-to-hold-plank/,"All hail the plank! But wait: How long should hold one? Here's your answer

Yes, you might have mastered the plank upgrades that can reshape your body. But there’s just one catch: While the act of planking is pretty straightforward, how long you should actually hold a plank is probably a bit less clear. Thankfully, the experts have you covered.

To reap the most rewards, holding three planks for up to 60 seconds each is ideal, according to Doug Sklar, a certified personal trainer and founder of PhilanthroFIT in New York City. “Holding a plank for 60 seconds with good form demonstrates an ability to utilize your core muscles under control for roughly the amount of time you may be performing other exercises,” Sklar says. (To switch up your plank game, check out these four easy plank exercises that will transform your abs.)

However, keep in mind that if you’re new to planking, you don’t want to risk injuring yourself in the name of a slimmer waistline. “As with any exercise, proper form reduces the risk of injury. Allowing your hips to drop puts you at risk of hyperextension of the spine which can result in back pain,” Sklar explains. “Imagine a straight line through your body passing from your ears through your shoulder, hips, knees, and down to your ankles.”

Refine your plank form

Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS, co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab and nutritional advisor to Promix Nutrition, breaks the form down further: Keep your fingers spread and hands shoulder-width apart, with wrists at a 90-degree angle and shoulders directly over wrists. Push the ground away from you as much as possible, and pull your shoulders away from your ears. Try to keep your feet and legs together. Squeeze your glutes and tighten your abs, so your hips tuck under and your low back flattens. Keep your neck in a neutral position.

If you have trouble maintaining this position, start with shorter plank holds, focusing on good form for five to 10 seconds. And then, as you maintain strong form and good posture, gradually increase that time, Sklar suggests. Aim for a set of three (holding for 10 seconds) and see if can maintain your body position before holding for longer. Also, don’t worry about losing out on any gains in the meantime; planking for shorter periods of time can still amount to a solid workout.

On the flip side, holding a plank for one minute might be a breeze for you. If that’s the case, Matheny recommends increasing the difficulty by adding some movement to the plank. Try tapping your shoulder with your opposite hand or driving your knees in, one at a time, for mountain climbers. (Also, try this one exercise that will give you a flat stomach in 10 minutes.)

Remember this for all plank variations: “Without proper form, you are not working your muscles, you are just putting stress on your joints or spine which can lead to injury,” Matheny says. “If you are not actively holding tension in your plank you are either relying on your joints/stacking of bones to keep your position, not your muscles.” So keep your full body strong.

Tired of the same old plank position? Mix up your workout routine with these exercises that flatten your belly—without a single crunch. Or skip the gym completely and turn to a few flat-belly tricks that don’t require a lick of exercise. You’ll be on your way to a stronger, toned core in no time.",This Is How Long You Need to Hold a Plank to Help Flatten Your Belly
Send anyone a crescent-moon emoji 🌙 on messenger. ,https://smartphones.gadgethacks.com/how-to/activate-dark-mode-facebook-messenger-0192439/,"Facebook has a new dark mode for Messenger , and it's a true OLED black theme. It's was hidden away in earlier versions and you needed to either run a root hack or send a moon emoji to activate it — but now, you can enable dark mode by toggling a simple switch in Facebook Messenger's settings.

Enabling Dark Mode

To begin, make sure you're running the latest version of Facebook Messenger (version 210.0.0.24.97 or higher). You can update the app by heading to your phone's respective app store, or you can tap one of the links below and select ""Update.""

Update Facebook Messenger: Android (free) | iOS (free)

Now, open Messenger and tap either the silhouette icon or your profile picture in the top-left corner of the main screen to open the app's settings. From there, just enable the ""Dark Mode"" toggle switch towards the top of the menu — it's as simple as that!

Once enabled, it's a true black dark mode, so you'll save battery life on phones with OLED screens like the iPhone XS or Galaxy S10. The theme was a work in progress previously, but now, it seems to be complete. So no more issues where there's black text overlaid on a black background — instead, it's a fully functional true dark mode for Messenger.

It's worth noting that Messenger's dark mode operates separately from the system-wide dark mode toggles on Android 10 and iOS 13. And if you're using Smart Invert to fill in the dark mode gaps on your iPhone, know that it will turn Messenger white again if the app's dark mode is enabled.",How to Activate Dark Mode in Facebook Messenger
Underestimating hidden costs. ,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/63-percent-of-millennial-homebuyers-have-regrets-heres-why.html,"Millennial homeownership has been off to a slow start. Roughly 1 in 3 millennials under the age of 35 own a home as of the end of 2018, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That's 8 to 9 percentage points lower than previous generations' homeownership rates at ages 25 to 34, according to research from the Urban Institute's Housing Finance Policy Center. Yet many of the younger people lucky enough to own a place still suffer from buyer's remorse. Nearly two-thirds, or 63 percent, of millennials (ages 23 to 38) say they have regrets about purchasing their current home, according to a new poll of about 1,500 homeowners from Bankrate. Only 35 percent of baby boomers (ages 55 to 73) say the same, while about 50 percent of Gen Xers (ages 39-54) cop to some remorse.

The top reason millennials have regrets

Underestimating the hidden costs associated with buying and owning a home, including the ongoing responsibilities of maintaining it, is the No. 1 millennial homeowner frustration. It's a common mistake, experts say, and it can be a costly one. You need to know that you can truly afford to both buy and own a home, and to get the full picture, you need to do more than simply compare your current rent payment with the potential mortgage payment, Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at real estate site Redfin, tells CNBC Make It. ""Do a full check of all finances,"" Fairweather says. ""A lot of hidden fees come with owning a home that you might not consider immediately."" That includes the insurance, property taxes and closing costs — which can be 2 to 5 percent of the home price. Those kinds of hidden costs even tripped up real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran early on. ""When I bought my first home I showed up at the table to close without the closing costs,"" she told CNBC Make It. ""Thank God I was able to borrow it from the very nice seller or I couldn't have closed on the place.""

First-time buyers also often overlook the costs of upkeep and repairs. HGTV recommends buyers plan to spend 1 to 3 percent of the home's purchase price on annual maintenance. So if the home is priced at $300,000, your budget for this should be at least $3,000 each year. It doesn't help that cash-strapped millennials often struggle to afford just the down payment: Roughly 1 in 3 millennial homebuyers took on a second job to save up for it. ""When paying for things like mortgages and student loans, [millennials] don't have much money to save for the hidden costs of owning a home,"" Fairweather says. The key to avoid regrets in the long run is to play it safe at the outset, Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, tells CNBC Make It: ""Start with a starter home and later trade up, rather than going for a 'dream home' on the first try.""

There's a 'shortage' of starter homes

Unfortunately, though, many millennial homeowners end up paying more than they wanted to or had budgeted for because there aren't many homes available at the prices young people can comfortably pay. ""Millennials have seen their rents go up year after year, and may think that buying a home is more affordable, but the fact of the matter is housing has become unaffordable across the board,"" Fairweather says. In many cities around the U.S., particularly in coastal areas, home prices are out of reach. Only 67 percent of homes available in 2018 located in metro areas tracked by Redfin were priced affordably for millennials — down from 71 percent of homes in 2017. In Los Angeles, only 19 percent of homes are in a price range that millennials can afford, based on their median incomes. ""We need more affordable-priced homes, and the shortage of these properties are forcing people to possibly over-stretch their budget,"" Yun says.

In a frying pan. ,https://www.foodandwine.com/news/reddit-freaking-out-over-genius-method-reheating-pizza,"Is there anyone out there who doesn’t love leftover pizza with all of their heart (maybe even a little more than fresh pizza)? Because if there are, we haven’t met them yet. When it comes to leftover ‘za, the only debate we’ve ever had with our friends is whether or not it should be heated. Many folks are of the mindset that all leftover pizza should be eaten cold for the full, genuine, leftover experience. And besides, reheated pizza—which is often pathetically revived in a microwave oven—is usually soggy, chewy, and altogether unappetizing.

It seems you just can’t have your day-old pizza pie and eat it, too.

But after reading about a reheating method that recently went viral over on Reddit, even the most devoted cold-pizza lovers among us would agree: It sounds like it’s worth a try.

Reddit user KevlarYarmulke shared the easy-to-follow instructional guide for reheating pizza the right way, which they claim to have found on a take-out menu from Roberta's pizzeria in Brooklyn. The method is simple, and all you need is a slice of cold pizza, a skillet, a lid, and some water.

First, you cook the pizza in the skillet on medium-low heat for 2 minutes to get it nice and crispy again (and warm!). Next, you put two drops of water into the pan, not too close to the slice itself, reduce the heat to low and cover the skillet for one minute so that it gets steamy. This allows the cheese on top to melt a bit and become gooey.

As the second-to-last frame of the diagram explains, you should be left with melty cheese, a moist crust, and a crispy bottom.",Reddit is Freaking Out Over this Genius Method for Reheating Pizza

A drone captured this coyote maneuvering over an icy Lake Michigan on February 23.

A coyote trotting across an iced-over body of water isn’t something most people see every day, which makes a recent drone video capturing the occurrence on Lake Michigan all the more unique.

Keenan May, who grew up in Leelanau County, Michigan, and is currently spending time there with his wife Kristen on paternity leave, is the man behind the astonishing footage.

The video, which May's father Paul posted on his YouTube account, shows the drone slowly passing over an almost completely frozen Lake Michigan as the coyote, appearing at times as a tiny and dark moving line from up above, races across it.

May, 35, initially intended to bring his drone out to capture the incredible ice formations on the lake as the sun went down around 6:30 p.m. on Feb. 23, he told AccuWeather. “Sunsets have been far and few lately due to all the cloud cover!” he said.

It was around sunset that he spotted the coyote running atop the ice across the vast lake. The sight was surprising, May said, as he and his family rarely see coyotes out in the open.

“Having spent over 20 years in Leelanau and a lot of my time outdoors, I’ve only seen them a handful of times,” he said, noting that it’s also quite rare to see coyotes that exposed during the daylight hours.

“I’ve seen them on the beach at night before, but never before sundown,” he added. “It was absolutely the right time, right place.”

The coyote appeared to be trotting down the beach far out on the ice paddies looking for food – possibly shore birds, May told AccuWeather.

“He simply passed by us, and we watched him for several minutes,” May said. “He never stopped for more than a minute.”

While May only takes his drone out to film cool nature shots every couple of months when he finds a good opportunity, he said the coyote footage is “definitely up there” in terms of the most interesting subjects he’s captured.

“The Lake Michigan shoreline isn’t always this iced over, some years can see little to no ice,” he said. “This, matched with the coyote who is hundreds of yards offshore along the other edge of ice, is pretty amazing.”

Literally nothing. ,https://www.iflscience.com/space/no-laser-signals-detected-from-mysterious-megastructure-star/,"Since its discovery three-and-a-half years ago, Boyajian’s star has fascinated professional astronomers as well as lay people alike. The star, also known as KIC 8462852, experienced unusual brightness fluctuations, which still remain without explanation.

Many naturally occurring phenomena have been proposed to solve the mystery – and, of course, some artificial ones. The star famously became known as the ""alien megastructure"" star, as some thought the changes in luminosity might be due to a large orbiting structure that could be used by an alien civilization to collect energy from the star.

Researchers have looked at this star time and time again, to see if they can spot any peculiar features that may aid them in the mystery. If there truly was a huge structure orbiting this star, how would the aliens transmit information and energy to and from it? The most likely answer is lasers, so researchers at the Breakthrough Listen Project have been looking for laser signals from the star. They didn’t find any.

The team analyzed 117 high-resolution spectra from Boyajian’s star using the Lick Observatory in California. Given the tech of the telescope and that the star is 1,470 light-years away, the team estimated that any laser more powerful than 24 megawatts would be detectable; powerful but not incredibly powerful (we developed megawatts lasers in the 1960s).

Nothing even close was seen by the team, led by David Lipman (then a high-school student, now at Princeton), who wrote an algorithm that sifts through the data. The top candidates in the study were either cosmic ray hits, regular stellar emission lines, or emission from our own atmosphere. The observations are reported in a paper available to read now on ArXiv, and it is published in the Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.

While the alien explanation has gone from the very unlikely to the extremely unlikely, the search for an answer goes on. Dr Tabetha Boyajian, lead author of the original discovery paper, continues to lead the community-funded efforts to study KIC 8462852. As posted on the project blog, the team has just restarted observations of the object in the hope of finally working out what’s going on. The main hypothesis is that the star is surrounded by a patchy donut of dust.

Boyajian’s star has gone through many names. It was also known as Tabby’s star after Dr Boyajian, though this is being phased out as objects named after people should be referred to by their surname. And at the very beginning, it was called the WTF star because the puzzled astronomers were very curious about “Where the Flux” of the star went as its brightness changed.

So, no lasers, and the mystery continues.

Get vaccinated. ,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/07/health/measles-josh-nerius/index.html,"(CNN) Three years ago, Joshua Nerius, a 30-year-old software product manager in Chicago, developed a high fever and a rash. Doctors prescribed antibiotics, but Nerius just got sicker and sicker.

Joshua went to the emergency room, where a doctor said it looked a lot like the measles. Had he been vaccinated as a child?

Nerius texted the question to his mother. She sent back a thumbs-down emoji.

His next stop was an isolation room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

Nerius became so weak that at one point, he couldn't walk without assistance. He lost 25 pounds. It took months to fully recover.

""I felt horrible,"" he said. ""It took a serious toll.""

He thinks about the current measles outbreak, which started in Washington state, where dozens of children have suffered because their parents chose not to vaccinate them.

He knows that their suffering -- and his own three years ago -- could have been avoided.

""It makes me so angry. My parents thought they were doing the right thing. They were persuaded by the anti-vaxers,"" he said.

Nerius is something of a unicorn: a living adult who experienced measles recently and can describe what it feels like.

It's easy to forget how sick people get from measles or how it killed 400 to 500 people in the United States each year before the vaccine came into use in 1963, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

""Measles is out of sight and out of mind, so we think it's no big deal, as Bill Shine's wife has said,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

Offit was referring to comments last month by Darla Shine, wife of the White House communications chief, who tweeted that she wished her children had had measles like she did as a girl.

""Bring back our #ChildhoodDiseases they keep you healthy,"" she wrote.

Offit, a professor of pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, thinks Shine might change her mind if she'd seen the children he cared for in 1991 during a measles outbreak in Philadelphia.

""They were absolutely miserable,"" he remembers. ""And occasionally, they were dead.""

Nine children died in that outbreak, according to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.

Offit can't understand why Shine and other anti-vaxers would prefer dead children over vaccinated children.

""When Darla Shine talks about how great it was that she had measles as a child, what she forgets to mention is that she gets to tell her story because she's alive. The ones who died -- we don't hear from them,"" he said.

Josh Nerius contracted measles in May 2016 at a graduation ceremony.

A near miss

Nerius remembers the scariest part of his bout with measles.

He contracted the disease in May 2016, at his sister's graduation from that Northern Illinois University College of Business. The Illinois Department of Health later determined that a guest who had traveled to the graduation from outside the United States had the measles, which is highly contagious.

""I didn't interact with anyone at that graduation besides my own family, so it was literally just me walking by someone,"" he said.

He says the scariest part is that the day after his sister's graduation, before he knew that he'd been infected, he attended a technology convention in Las Vegas with thousands of other people.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""I was shaking hands with hundreds of people a day. I wasn't contagious yet, but it's sobering to think if the timing had been just slightly different, how many people I could have infected,"" he said.

Nerius doesn't blame his parents for not vaccinating him. He says they were believers in alternative medicine, and in the 1980s, there was no Internet where they could double-check what they were being told by anti-vaxers.

But today's parents have no excuse, he says. They can go to the American Academy of Pediatrics or a multitude of other sites to learn that vaccines are safe and keep children healthy.

""The science on this has been settled. It's been solved. When I look at where we are today, with people who are willfully deciding to ignore the facts, it really frustrates me,"" Nerius said. ""I just don't understand the mindset of people who want to spread fear.""","Anti-vaxers' adult son gets measles; now, he has this message for the world"
Walmart. ,https://www.rd.com/article/grocery-store-worst-repuation-america/,"Grocery stores are more dividing than you think. Here's what people love and hate about your favorite stores—and which one is the worst of all.

Jeff Chiu/AP/REX/Shutterstock

Not all grocery stores are created equal. And according to a recent survey from Consumer Reports, more than 50,000 food shoppers have some serious complaints about specific stores.

Surveyors complained mostly about grocery stores with too few checkout lanes and long lines, congested aisles, too few food choices, and a poor selection of local products. Some of the worst offenders include Target, Aldi, and Stop and Shop. But the worst of the worst, according to survey results, is Walmart.

The discount chain store undoubtedly has competitive pricing. In fact, that’s the one category where Walmart was highly ranked. The low overall ranking, however, stems from low rankings in seven out of 12 possible categories. This includes cleanliness, staff courtesy, checkout speed, produce and meat quality, and local produce selection. That’s a far cry from the grocery store with the best reputation.

The superstore also came in last in the supermarket category in the most recent report by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Again, customers were dissatisfied with the slow checkout speed and unfriendliness of the staff. The stores taking the top spots on ACSI’s report were Trader Joe’s and Wegmans—these stores also show up consistently as being highly rated grocery stores in the United States for overall value, too.



Walmart has also faced criticism in the past for its poor relationship with workers. Business Insider reports that the company even spent more than $18 million on ads in 2017 to highlight recent investments and changes in company policy.

On the bright side, some popular stores did rank well. Fareway Stores, Wegmans, and Publix are amongst the top. Only about 23 to 30 percent of surveyors had a complaint about them—making them the least complained about in the ratings. Can’t find one of these stores near you?

Plastic. ,https://www.unilad.co.uk/science/submarine-team-discover-whats-at-bottom-of-belizes-great-blue-hole-where-light-doesnt-reach,"A submarine team delved into the mysterious depths of Belize’s Great Blue Hole to discover what’s lying hidden in the areas light doesn’t reach.

Scientists recently set out to search the gaping sinkhole, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site and measures 300 meters (984 feet) in width, and reaches a depth of 124 meters (407 feet).

Earlier this year, the team shone a light into the hole to discover what lay beneath, and they were met with a saddening scene when they found plastic littering the site.

But there were depths the light couldn’t reach, and so the researchers had to try a different method to figure out what the ocean was concealing.

In a blog post, Erika Bergman, oceanographer and the chief submarine pilot on the expedition, explained by using sonar, the team were able to produce a three-dimensional image of the sinkhole.

Advert 10

They focused on certain points of interest, including stalactite caverns formed when sea levels were lower, and the hole was a dry cave, which have now been encrusted by marine growth.

At 290 feet deep the team found a calcium carbonate layer where a coral reef used to grow, and at 407 feet they found evidence of some small stalactite and stalagmite formations, which had been covered in sand over time.

Data found below a hydrogen sulfide layer at 300 feet, the hole is completely anoxic, meaning there’s not a single drop of oxygen in the water.

The lack of oxygen was also evidenced by a ‘conch graveyard’, which Bergman described as ‘a stretch of the blue hole where we observed hundreds of dead conch that had presumably fallen in to the hole’.

She added:

We can see each conch with little tracks back up the hill trying to escape, then a slide mark where it slid back down after presumably being asphyxiated in the anoxic environment.

It doesn’t sound like a pleasant end for the poor conch.

Bergman called the hole ‘otherwordly’, and it certainly sounds it!

A creepy conch graveyard isn’t quite what springs to mind when you picture the luxurious Caribbean sea.

Green eyes. ,"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/only-two-percent-world-population-211657873.html#:~:text=Green%20eyes.,that%20to%20other%20eye%20colors.","Lots of traits are statistically rare: Left-handedness (just 10 percent of the population!), curly hair (11 percent!), and blond hair (4 percent!), to name a few. But of the more than seven billion people on the planet, only 2 percent can claim to have this one special trait. (To put that in perspective, that’s 140 million people).

So what’s this rare trait only one in fifty of us possess? Green eyes. That’s right, just 2 percent of the world’s population is lucky enough to have ’em, according to World Atlas.

Compare that to other eye colors. For example, some 79 percent of the population has brown eyes, while 8 percent has blue. About 5 percent of people have hazel eyes and another 5 percent have amber eyes. Simply put, green eyes are incredibly unique. (Unique enough, in fact, to give Chris Martin the inspiration that would make Coldplay an overnight success).

Green eyes are most common in Central, Western, and Northern Europe, and typically point to Celtic or German ancestry. At the moment, they’re most prevalent in Britain, Iceland, the Netherlands, Scotland, Estonia, and Scandinavia. In fact, according to a study conducted by ScotlandsDNA, in Britain, brown eyes are rarer than green. There, 22 percent of the population has brown eyes, compared to the jaw-dropping 30 percent that has green.

To get green eyes, the irises need a unique blend of “light brown pigmentation, yellowish lipochrome pigment, and a splash of Rayleigh scattering,” according to Eyesite Opticians. And interestingly enough, it can take up to three years for green eyes to appear in small children, as the Rayleigh scattering takes time to form and appear in humans.

Despite green eyes being such a rarity, numerous characters in literature and film have them, perhaps to convey a sense of mystery. In fact, many researchers believe that eye color is a true indicator of personality. For example, researchers from the University of Queensland and the University of New South Wales found that they tended to be less agreeable, more competitive, creative, devious, and shy.

So there you have it. If eyes truly are the windows of the soul, that means that people with green eyes possess the rarest souls on the planet. For more on that note, check out the 20 Amazing Facts You Never Knew About Your Body.

He wanted to challenge traditional concepts of masculinity. ,https://twentytwowords.com/billy-porter-wore-gown-instead-tux-oscars/,"Billy Porter, star of hit television show Pose, subverted expectations by wearing a tuxedo gown on the Oscars red carpet tonight. The custom gown was designed by Christian Siriano and was actually a two-piece outfit made up of a strapless gown with a tuxedo jacket over top.

The outfit felt like a fun wink to the gender-normative tuxedos worn by every other man on the carpet, but according to Porter, there was a deeper, more poignant reason he chose to wear it.

He chose to say something with his clothing choice. via Getty Images Porter told Vogue, “I’ve always been inspired by fashion. My grandmother, my mom—they were always stylish. I grew up loving fashion, but there was a limit to the ways in which I could express myself. When you’re black and you’re gay, one’s masculinity is in question. I dealt with a lot of homophobia in relation to my clothing choices. [Even] when I had my first working contract at A&M Records, I was silent for a long time. I was trying to fit in to what other people felt I should look like. When I landed a role in Kinky Boots, the experience really grounded me in a way that was so unexpected. Putting on those heels made me feel the most masculine I’ve ever felt in my life. It was empowering to let that part of myself free.”

And we are absolutely blown away. via Getty Images He continued with, “Now I’m in a space where, being on Pose, I’m invited to red carpets and I have something to say through clothes. My goal is to be a walking piece of political art every time I show up. To challenge expectations. What is masculinity? What does that mean?”

It's a hoax and reveals how vulnerable people are to misinformation. ,https://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-truth-about-the-momo-suicide-challenge-is-actually-more-disturbing-than-you-think/,"Embedded in children's videos are “surprise eggs” spliced in by unknown hackers featuring a wide-mouthed figurine with hauntingly large eyes taunting in a child-like voice, “ Momo, Momo, Momo is going to kill us .” Facebook/Police Service of Northern Ireland

A creepy doll-like figure is at the center of a disturbing new twist to viral challenges reportedly responsible for sending graphic violent images and daring children to inflict self-harm and intentionally kill themselves. Fair warning: This article contains some disturbing content and may be distressing to children.

The “Momo Challenge” joins the ranks of recent viral challenges hyped by the media. The cyberbullying attempt targets young children watching seemingly innocent videos on YouTube Kids and other platforms. Embedded in these videos posted by unknown hackers are “surprise eggs” featuring a wide-mouthed figurine with hauntingly large eyes taunting in a child-like voice, “Momo, Momo, Momo is going to kill us.” In videos seen by IFLScience, they prompt viewers to call or text a number displayed on the screen. Various reports allege that contact with this number would be followed by dares to inflict self-harm or take one’s life. According to the UK’s National Online Safety (NOS) organization, the Momo Challenge has been around for some time and is once again resurfacing with links to apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and YouTube Kids.

“In all the hysteria, multiple claims of ‘hacked’ Peppa Pig videos have run rampant, but in all cases, the only thing that exists are warnings about said videos, rather than the videos themselves. This itself is some sort of collective meme recollection from 2017, where pranksters spliced genuine footage of children's cartoons with horrible inserts – entirely unrelated to Momo. It seems people are tying it up into older unrelated YouTube antics. It is doubtful that any hacking of YouTube videos to insert this redundant meme into them is taking place and based on what I've seen so far anyone under the age of 15 has rolled their eyes at Momo's return from its Creepypasta grave,” Chris Boyd, senior threat researcher at Malwarebytes, told IFLScience.

-

It Is Just An Urban Legend

Just like Creepypasta, Momo is made to look like an urban legend or viral challenge and uses the media to say as much, perpetuating its supposed legitimacy. Concerns about child safety have prompted thousands of users to share warnings, but danger lies in repeating rumors without solid evidence.

“These stories being highly publicized and starting a panic means vulnerable people get to know about it and that creates a risk,” a spokesperson with Samaritans told The Guardian. Others continue that media outlets should read their guidelines on reporting suicide.

-

Momo May Be A Front For Hacking

Officials say it's more than just about scaring kids – the “sinister” suicide game covers up hackers trying to steal information, reports the BBC in a recent article.

“This extremely disturbing challenge conceals itself within other harmless-looking games or videos played by children and when downloaded, it asks the user to communicate with 'Momo' via popular messaging applications such as WhatsApp. It is at this point that children are threatened that they will be cursed or their family will be hurt if they do not self-harm,"" said Police Service of Northern Ireland in a statement. Parents should take care to educate their children about online safety, particularly discouraging them from contacting strangers or sharing personal information.

YouTube Says They Have Seen No Evidence Of Momo

An average of 300 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube every minute, which presents a challenge for moderators to catch all inappropriate content. When a viewer sees a Momo-related video, an investigation conducted by NOS found that “countless other Momo themed videos and other scary content” not appropriate for children is cued in the platforms Up Next feature.

""We want to clear something up regarding the Momo Challenge: We’ve seen no recent evidence of videos promoting the Momo Challenge on YouTube. Videos encouraging harmful and dangerous challenges are against our policies,"" said YouTube in a Tweet.

No Deaths Have Been Linked To The Momo Challenge

Momo made its first appearance in the news cycle last year after reports of a 12-year-old girl had reportedly killed herself after having been motivated by the viral challenge. Similarly, Indian media reported two deaths by suicide of people allegedly participating in the challenge. However, official documentation is lacking in both instances, and UK-based digital safety organization Parent Zone writes that there is little evidence of any deaths directly tied to Momo.

Most Importantly, Do Your Research And Talk With Your Children

The Ohio Department of Education says the Momo Challenge can be a teachable moment for parents to have positive conversations with their children and to monitor their online usage.

Suicide is the third leading cause of death among youth and young adults age 10 to 24, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NOS advises parents to remind their children that Momo is not real (after all, the figurine was just a Japanese prop named “Mother Bird” displayed in an art exhibit three years ago) and that it cannot hurt them or control their behavior. Parents can also set up parental controls, such as turning off YouTube’s suggested auto-play feature and reporting harmful content that goes against YouTube's Community Guidelines.","The Truth About The ""Momo Suicide Challenge"" Is Actually More Disturbing Than You Think"
Absence of conflict could mean your partner doesn't care anymore. ,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/biggest-sign-divorce-men-never-221140305.html,"No one walks down the aisle with the intention of splitting up later. But, unfortunately, approximately 50 percent of marriages in the U.S. end in divorce. And if you do find yourself sitting across from your former spouse with lawyers by your sides, it's important to remember it's not the end of the world. After all, while divorce will inevitably shake up your life in many ways, it will also free you from the negativity of an unhealthy marriage. For help shifting your outlook, read on to learn the major upsides of divorce no one expects. And for more on divorce, check out the 25 Secrets Your Divorce Lawyer Won't Tell You. 1\. Your mental and physical health improves.While you’ve probably heard about the health benefits of happy marriages, divorce can have some, too—especially if your relationship was rocky or unstable. One long-term study conducted by researchers at the University of Nevada and the University of Michigan found that marital conflict leads to damaging responses in the body, such as inflammation, changes in appetite, and increased release of stress hormones, all of which can affect numerous aspects of your health.“Conflict can be particularly damaging for health if spouses are hostile or defensive during disagreements or if they are arguing about the same topic over and over again without any resolution,” says Rosie Shrout, who presented the study's results at the International Association for Relationship Research conference in 2018. Resolving your conflicts with a separation or divorce can lower your stress levels and improve your health. 2\. You might develop better financial habits.Although divorce is often painted as disastrous for financial wellness, it could actually push you toward a paradigm shift in how you think about money. During a divorce, both partners must take a deeper look at their financial realities, which can help you craft a better budget and stick with it. “Divorce forces people to have a budget, and if they stick with that budget they can actually get in a better place financially,” says certified divorce financial analyst Nicole N. Middendorf, a wealth advisor and the CEO of Prosperwell. 3\. You’ll develop increased patience.Patience might be a virtue, but it’s often one in short supply, especially in the throes of a contentious marriage. A painful experience like divorce can present an opportunity to cultivate stronger coping skills as you learn to move passed the grief and other challenges divorce presents.“Remember that everything you're going through is temporary,” urges Jennifer Giamo, founder of Fresh Start Fitness, which helps women heal and thrive after divorce. “What may feel like the end of the world at the moment will change and shift over time and it will get better. Being patient—however difficult—is part of the process that will lead to a more peaceful place.” 4\. You’ll have more adventures.Instead of miring yourself in the everyday difficulties of marital conflict like you may have been doing, think of the post-divorce world as your oyster.Divorce and family lawyer Randall Kessler of Kessler&Solomiany, LLC says that after a marital separation, “You can pursue passions your ex didn’t have, like travel, sports, art, or hundreds of others.” With time, you can think differently not only about your divorce but about your entire future. 5\. You'll be a better parent.Many married couples with children worry that a separation will negatively affect their kids. But divorce attorney Lisa Marie Bustos, of Bustos Family Law, PLLC in Austin, Texas, explains that it’s often the opposite. “One of the more unexpected benefits that I've seen with divorce clients is that the quality of their parenting improves,” she explains.“Often times, parents are splitting time with their children. Dad may have the kids on Monday and Tuesday, and Mom may have the kids on Wednesday and Thursday. Instead of running the daily rat race of being the ‘everything to everyone’ type of parent, a parent who splits custody can actually focus on their children when they have visitation with them.” 6\. Your kids will have stronger relationships later in life.One University of Central Florida study on college students from both divorced and intact families found that those whose parents were divorced often had more successful relationships than those whose parents were together.And David Mahl, another researcher on children of divorce, concluded that “divorce can strengthen kids’ ability to sustain successful relationships, but only if their parents stay supportive throughout the ordeal.” 7\. You’ll get better sleep.With the stress of a bad marriage off your shoulders and some new space in your bed, you might be able to get a little more shut eye after a divorce. One study published in the journal Psychiatry Research found that among individuals whose divorces had been finalized, the amount of time they spent in delta-wave sleep (which is ideal quality sleep) had improved. 8\. You can become a mindfulness whiz.Being aware in the moment is key to navigating any stressful circumstance, from a tricky situation at the office to a divorce. Giamo says that meditation, yoga, and other mindfulness practices can help you work through your divorce—and might even become a whole new wellness routine.“I found meditation and yoga to be super helpful when I was going through my divorce,” she says. “It really helped to calm me down and stop my mind from racing. The breathing techniques also come in really handy when you feel yourself getting frustrated.” 9\. You could find your new favorite hobby.Remember all those things your ex didn’t want to try with you? The RV you wanted to buy for a cross-country road trip? The salsa dancing classes you never had time to take? Well, in the wake of a divorce, try to think of life as a smorgasbord of opportunities, ready for you to try one by one.“Focus on building your life,” says Tina B. Tessina, Ph.D., psychotherapist and author of Dr. Romance’s Guide to Finding Love Today. According to Tessina, the aftermath of divorce is ""a great time to try something other than a relationship: take a class, start a new business or career, get a puppy."" Just go for it! 10\. You'll finally get in shape.An unhappy marriage is a major stressor that often stops people from getting fit, especially if they’ve adopted unhealthy eating and exercise habits with their spouse.Whether you think of your path to fitness as a “revenge body” or just a positive transformation, a divorce can serve as a great motivation to get moving and get fit. “The most important thing to remember when going through a divorce is to maintain your health and wellbeing,” Giamo says. “It can be the most stressful time in your life, and if you don't manage it properly with good nutrition and exercise (which is sometimes the last thing you feel like doing), it can feel even more overwhelming.” 11\. You’ll have more satisfying sex.While there hasn't been much formal research on the subject of sexual satisfaction after divorce, researchers do know that sex in general peaks around the age most people experience a split. According to one study published by Women in the World, women don't hit their sexual stride until after their 36th birthday. And most people who get divorced are in their mid-to-late 40s, according to Jonathan Fields, a divorce litigator. See how that works out?Divorce can also be a chance to reassess what you really like and dislike intimately and what you want to look for in a new relationship. “Divorced people find it much easier to get back in the saddle so to speak,"" Dr. Andy Trees, author of A Scientific Guide to Successful Dating, told CNN. ""Sex with someone new is always exciting in a way that sex with a familiar partner isn't (which isn't to say that long-term sexual intimacy doesn't have pluses as well).” 12\. You can get some extra cash flow.If you need a little extra cash flow, a divorce can sometimes give you an unexpected boost. With a qualified domestic relations order in place as part of your divorce agreement, you can withdraw money from your retirement account—without having to pay that nasty IRA early withdrawal penalty. And while it's definitely not the best idea to dip into that retirement account, it's nice to know the option is available if you truly fall on hard times after a split. 13\. You’ll find out who your real friends are.Many of the benefits of divorce have to do with starting fresh—and that includes learning who your real friends are, who you can trust, and who really has your back through thick and thin.""You don’t need to talk anyone into staying friends with you,"" explains Babble's Katie Bingham-Smith. ""Instead, your life shifts in order to bring the right people around you—and before you know it, you will find the support you need."" 14\. You’ll find yourself.When you go through something as difficult as a divorce, it can be a chance to take a long, hard look at yourself, and come to know yourself (the good, the bad, and everything in between) in a whole new way.“I discovered who I really was after my divorce,"" says licensed clinical social worker Beatty Cohan. ""It may never have happened had I stayed married.” 15\. You can break your old patterns.Toxic or difficult relationships often push us to develop bad habits, like unhealthy eating, excessive drinking or spending, or sedentary lifestyles. In addition to taking on new adventures or hobbies, try a little habit-pruning after your divorce. Use journaling techniques or head to therapy to try to root out some of the negative patterns in your life. 16\. You might even find peace…even with your ex.""Peaceful"" might not be the word that comes to mind when you think of divorce. But finding closure after a divorce can actually help you gain a sense of peace and perhaps a friendship with your ex, even if that seems impossible at first, says licensed social worker Daniel S. Sokal. “Divorce can lead a couple that was locked into long-term repetitive relational conflict loops to a more civil and peaceful coexistence,” he explains. 17\. Your next relationship is likely to be much better.Even a bad marriage can prepare you for a better one. Without all the baggage of your old relationship weighing you down, you can take on a whole new approach to dating and prepare for a healthier love in the future. In fact, “second marriages are often happier,"" says Tessina.And one study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies confirmed that. ""Previously married individuals experience a stronger increase in both happiness and satisfaction when entering a new partnership than never-married individuals,"" wrote Morten Blekesaune of Agder University in Norway, who led the study. ""One possible explanation is that previously married individuals have … different expectations than never-married individuals.""

$233.00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/30/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-full-time-uber-lyft-and-juno-driver-in-nyc.html,"Al Castillo doesn't have a traditional job. As a full-time rideshare driver in New York City, his office is his 2017 Honda Pilot. Castillo, 33, started driving for apps like Uber, Lyft and Juno about four years ago, and he's been driving professionally for much longer. Before ridesharing took off in New York City, he drove school buses for seven years. He also drove for taxi service companies, which is how many New Yorkers got from point A to point B before Uber arrived in May 2011. What's it really like to drive full-time in one of the busiest cities in America? I spent a day on the road with Castillo to find out.

The hours

Castillo typically works six days a week, Monday through Saturday. On weekdays, he starts driving between 6 and 7 a.m. and finishes up between 4 and 5 p.m. That's nine to 11 hours a day. On Saturday, he starts his day a little later, between 8 and 9 a.m. On this particular morning, a Wednesday, he was ""feeling sleepy,"" he tells me, and left his home in Brooklyn at 7 a.m. First, though, he grabbed breakfast at Dunkin' Donuts. The flexibility that comes with being your own boss makes up for the long hours, says Castillo. The father of three schedules his day so that he can be home in time to pick his kids up from school, help with homework and have a family dinner. Castillo with his family

The earnings

On a typical day, Castillo brings home $250. If he works Monday to Saturday, that's $1,500 per week, which comes out to about $6,000 a month. He earns an additional $100 to $300 per month by using Cargo, which pays him a monthly rate for selling products like snacks and headphones to passengers, and Play Octopus, which pays him to mount a tablet that offers trivia games and plays ads. That means, theoretically, he's earning $72,000 a year from rides and between $1,200 and $3,600 a year from Cargo and Play Octopus, for a total of about $75,000 before taxes. Castillo gets paid per ride and his earnings depend on how long the trip is, how much distance he covers and whether or not there's ""surge pricing,"" which is when demand for rides is high and prices for passengers goes up. Surge pricing, or ""prime time,"" as Lyft calls it, tends to happen during rush hour, bad weather or if there's a big event going on in the area. Castillo and I check in on his earnings periodically. A mid-morning, 22-minute UberX trip earns him nearly $10. The app doesn't show how much the customer paid — it just breaks down Castillo's take: He earns a base rate (what you're paid to start the ride) of $1.83, a time rate (what you earn per minute in your region) of $5.49, and a distance rate (what you earn per mile in your region) of $2. Total: $9.32.

Al Castillo has been driving for Uber, Lyft and Juno for four years Source: CNBC Make It

Uber and Lyft both collect about 30 percent of all passenger fares, Castillo tells me. Juno takes just 16 percent, but it's not as popular an app yet, he adds. Sure enough, we don't get one call from Juno over the course of the day and, instead, flip back and forth between Uber and Lyft. He has all three because, depending on what neighborhood he's driving in, one app may be busier than the others. ""People in Bed Stuy [Brooklyn] like to use Lyft,"" he says. ""If you're in Queens, people like Juno."" The more rides he completes, the more he gets paid, so ""you want to be busy all the time,"" he tells me. ""Our time is money.""

Our time is money. Al Castillo full-time rideshare driver

That's why Castillo rarely takes breaks throughout the day. We don't make our first pit stop until 2 p.m., when Castillo runs into his mother-in-law's apartment to use the bathroom. He does this once or twice a day, he tells me. Besides that, we pull over once more to stretch our legs. Castillo doesn't stop for a meal or eat during his entire shift. That's not entirely normal, though: He usually packs a lunch from home that he'll eat in his car, but today's breakfast, he assures me, was filling. After about nine hours on the road — 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. — Castillo makes $233 across 15 rides. Nine rides and $140 come from Lyft, while six rides and $93 come from Uber. ""That's a good day,"" he tells me, especially considering he took more breaks than usual to accommodate my filming. On his best day, Castillo took home $540 after nine hours of driving, thanks to surge pricing. One-fifth of that came from a single, lucrative trip to the airport, he says: ""It was snowing and it was ugly outside. It was like 5:30 or 6 p.m., peak hours. They paid me like $110.""

The expenses

While Castillo can earn about $6,000 per month, the expenses that come with the gig add up. For starters, he needs a car. He drove a Nissan Pathfinder up until a couple of months ago, when he upgraded to a 2017 Honda Pilot. He bought it nearly brand new — it had just 25 miles on it — for about $40,000, he says. The vehicle was a worthwhile investment, Castillo tells me, because it can fit more passengers, which means he can pick up bigger groups and earn more money. Plus, it comes with features like automatic braking, a back-up camera and a sunroof. ""We go everywhere, so your car's gotta be 100 percent,"" he says.

Here's a breakdown of the other expenses he has to factor in: TLC driver license: $252 to renew every three years ($84 per year) To pick up riders in New York City, Castillo needs a special license called a TLC driver license, which costs $252 to renew every three years. TLC vehicle renewal: $625 every other year ($312.50 per year) Every other year, Castillo has to renew his car and bring it in for a thorough inspection. This costs $625: $550 for the renewal fee and $75 for the inspection fee. Regular inspections: $37 every four months ($111 per year) As a rideshare driver in New York state, Castillo also has to do more regular inspections — every four months — at the DMV. These cost $37 each. NYC commercial motor vehicle tax: $400 per year (to DMV) Vehicle registration: $456 per year

Insurance: $400 per month ($4,800 per year) The cost of insurance depends on your driving record and can vary anywhere from $400 to $800 per month, Castillo estimates, though he pays closer to $400 a month. Gas: $675 per month ($8,100 per year) Gas also varies per driver and depends on your car model, how much you drive and where you're driving. Castillo says he fills up his tank every other day for $45. That's about $675 per month. Maintenance: About $2,500 per year This includes oil changes, tire repairs and brake repairs. Castillo has to change his oil every four to five weeks, which costs $70 each time. His brakes are inspected every three months, which costs about $220 each time. As for tires, they get checked out every three months. It costs about $100 to repair each tire, but not every tire has to be repaired every time, he says. Other Drivers are required to do a drug test every year and take courses in things like defensive driving and wheelchair passenger assistance, which they pay for out of pocket. Plus, Castillo buys cleaning products — he wipes down his leather seats every day — and gets the exterior of his car cleaned every few days. Unexpected costs like traffic and parking tickets can also arise. In total, that's about $17,000 of expenses to account for each year. Plus, he owes taxes on his earnings. Like any freelancer, he fills out a 1099 tax form every year to report his income.

The best part of the job

Besides the flexibility that comes with being your own boss, Castillo loves the social aspect of the job. On this particular day, we complete 15 rides and pick up about 30 passengers from all walks of life: a mother and daughter visiting from North Carolina, a caterer delivering lunch in midtown Manhattan and co-workers from a Brooklyn-based start-up that makes dog food. Castillo talks to everyone. ""I like to meet people,"" he tells me. ""I like to talk to people of different backgrounds.""

I like to meet people. I like to talk to people of different backgrounds. Al Castillo full-time rideshare driver

The hardest part of the job

The passengers can also be the toughest part of his job, though — dealing with the ones with attitude, that is. The best way to handle unhappy passengers is to simply stay calm, he tells me, and to remember that ""you only gotta be with them in the car for 10, 20 minutes."" After that, you never have to see them again. Driving in New York City is no easy task, either, he adds, especially in Manhattan: ""You gotta be aware of the yellow cabs, bikes, people. When the light is green, people are crossing the street so we always gotta be looking at our mirror every second. You always gotta be aware.""

What it takes to be a great rideshare driver

If you want to stand out, you need three things, Castillo tells me. 1. A phone charger for passengers. After all, ""everybody always need a charger,"" he says. 2. Patience. ""If you don't have patience to drive and to meet people and deal with people, don't do it,"" says Castillo. ""Because patience is the most important thing. You're not only driving — you're dealing with traffic, you're dealing with bikes, you're dealing with the customer."" 3. A good vibe. ""Vibe is everything,"" Castillo tells me, and it's important to read your passengers, too. If they're on a phone call, for example, turn the music down.

Show Caption Hide Caption The world's going to end eventually, but not like this! Many 'doomsday' predictions have surfaced over the years. Here's a look at four of the most notable ones. USA TODAY

David Meade, who claimed the world will end Saturday, said doomsday isn't this weekend after all.

“The world is not ending, but the world as we know it is ending,” he told The Washington Post. “A major part of the world will not be the same the beginning of October.”

Meade, Christian and self-published author, laid out his ""astronomical, scientific, the Book of Revelation and geopolitics"" ideology in his book Planet X — The 2017 Arrival. He claims Sept. 23 ""Planet Nibiru"" will collide with the Earth.

But now Meade is saying this event won't mark the apocalypse, but rather a series of dire events over the course of weeks, The Washington Post reports.

NASA has said ""Nibiru"" or ""Planet X"" doesn't exist and this is a hoax. Christian leaders have also disputed the claims. Christianity Today calls Meade ""a made-up leader in a made-up field.""

Even some translations of Biblical scripture refutes men making claims about knowing the date of the end. Just take a look at Matthew 24:36, which says: ""But about that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.""

Many like Meade have tried to pinpoint doomsday in the past. But, here we all are. At least for now.

700 years. ,https://www.mlive.com/life/2019/02/how-long-would-it-take-to-zamboni-lake-superior-up-company-does-the-math.html,"MARQUETTE, MICH. -- If you had to wait for a Zamboni driver to clear all of Lake Superior before you could hop on the ice for a pick-up game, you’d be sitting in your skates for nearly 700 years.

That’s the conclusion made by the folks at U.P. Supply Co., a Marquette-based company specializing in Upper Peninsula gear and creative promotion of U.P. pride.

This week the company posed the question “How long would it take to Zamboni an entirely frozen Lake Superior?,"" and then unpacked the math in a blog post on the company’s website.

As of today Lake Superior ice cover is 8% ahead of where it was in 1996, the only year it reached 100% ice cover in the... Posted by Upper Peninsula Supply Co. on Monday, February 25, 2019

For several years the question has been on the mind of company founder and self-described U.P. ambassador Bugsy Sailor, who grew up playing hockey along Lake Superior.

“I’m obsessed with the lake and the size of it, and I think there’s a sense that when we see it every day, we take it for granted,” he said. “We lose that perspective of just how big it really is.”

Sailor originally posed the question on social media a few years ago, but this year, given Superior’s unusually high percentage of ice cover (the lake is currently more than 75 percent frozen; the average this time of year is 44 percent), he decided it was time to do the math.

“It’s pretty simple math, really,” Sailor said. “A matter of some basic conversions.”

After accounting for size, the hardest calculation was time, Sailor said. The conservative estimate for resurfacing all of Lake Superior came out to 693 years -- but when you account for variables like Zamboni repairs, switching out drivers, and perhaps pausing for a quick pick-up game, the actual time estimate would be much longer.

The Zamboni Lake Superior equation is just the latest creative take on Upper Peninsula love from U.P. Supply Co., which has made a name for itself over the past decade with its fun promotions of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

Sailor and his U.P. Supply Co. crew are also behind the increasingly popular tradition of 906 Day -- a celebration of all things U.P. on September 6 each year, inspired by the region’s singular area code -- and they particularly enjoy a good U.P.-themed April Fool’s joke. (Previous pranks have included launching the online dating site Yooper Singles, as well as announcing breaking ground in Lansing for an official Upper Peninsula embassy -- in a log cabin, of course.)

So what will be the company’s next great brainstorm? Sailor wouldn’t directly answer the question, but the smile was audible in his voice.

“We’re always trying to find clever ideas to represent the U.P.,” Sailor said. “We’re always working on something behind the scenes that no one really know about yet.”",How long would it take to Zamboni Lake Superior? U.P. company does the math
They indicate cross-currents which are dangerous. ,https://www.apost.com/en/blog/you-need-to-get-out-of-the-water-immediately-if-you-see-these-square-waves-in-the-ocean/12012/,"You Need To Get Out Of The Water Immediately If You See These Square Waves In The Ocean

Our planet is truly a magnificent and mesmerizing land and water mass. While its beauty often captivates us into exploration, its strength and power remind us that we are mere visitors to what belongs to Mother Nature and must be careful of her dangers.

The latest example of such balance between marvel and caution is a photograph taken off the Isle of Rhe, a now popular French tourist destination. It captures a new definition of a perfect storm, and it’s not a massive tidal wave.

The isle is just a short and narrow sliver of land that spans three miles wide by 19 miles long. It’s most famous worldly mention heretofore was perhaps within the book “The Expedition To The Isle Of Rhe,” by Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury, K.B. This little-known book was published in 1860 and tells the story of a fleet of 100 English ships carrying over 6,000 men becoming bogged down on the tiny island while fighting the French in 1627.

Today, however, the Isle of Rhe is famous for the photography that captured “square waves,” which are the perfect example of how nature’s vast power and force can come in such an alluringly beautiful package.

apost.com

These unique waves appear in a chessboard grid across the water, forming unique square patterns that have been captured by photographers at the isle’s lighthouse. The photographs have become quite the internet sensation, and people are wondering what in the world caused the distinctive square waves and why people are just now seeing them?

The how is that the island lies in an area where two seas meet. The intersection of water is called a cross sea. When two wave systems (one from each sea) are created by two different weather systems and cross each other perpendicularly, it can create the grid waves like those seen off the coast of Rhe. There’s a catch, though.

The conditions must be just right to visually see what’s happening. Waves, or swells, travel long distances over the surface of the water, often to far away shores from the weather system that created them. When these swells collide in the presence of minimal wind sea, it creates a cross-sea grid.

The angle of approach is also important. Too shallow and it may appear that the swells come from the same direction. Not enough energy and the flattened crest will be nearly impossible to distinguish. Too much local wind shear and the swell’s shape is broken. If you’re looking flat at the sea, which most are from a beach, it can also be difficult to spot the square waves.

So, the presence of cross sea is quite common, but actually seeing the visual effects in pattern form requires a perfect storm of conditions. And, these conditions are rarely all aligned.

While stunning to view in person, note that cross seas are some of the most dangerous waters known to man because of the unusually strong riptides that can carry you far out to sea within seconds. It’s easy to be lulled by the beauty and novelty of the square waves from cross seas, but never think you’re stronger than Mother Nature. Entering this perfect storm of colliding swells isn’t advised.

Restaurant meals. ,https://www.fool.com/personal-finance/2019/02/23/this-is-what-americans-regret-spending-money-on-th.aspx,"Making smart choices about what you do with your money will help set you up for a secure future. Unfortunately, most of us don't make the right financial choices all the the time -- and sometimes we end up regretting the decisions we make.

In fact, one recent survey from Charles Schwab shows the majority of Americans regret doing some past spending, instead of putting that money into retirement savings. And, there's one particular kind of spending the majority of Americans regretted the most.

What's the biggest spending regret Americans have?

About 55% of survey respondents regretted spending money on meals out instead of putting that money into a 401(k), according to Charles Schwab. Dining out was by far the biggest regret cited, with spending on expensive clothes ranking second (31% of respondents lamenting using cash to expand their wardrobes).

New cars, vacations, and tech gadgets round out the list of five biggest spending regrets, with 28% of those surveyed saying they regretted their expenditures on cars or vacations, and 26% wishing they hadn't put so much money into keeping up with the latest technologies.

It's not surprising so many Americans regret dining out. The Bureau of Labor Statistics 2017 report on Consumer Expenditures found average spending of $3,365 annually on food away from home in 2017, up from $3,154 on dining out in 2016. And don't forget that when you dine out, you're paying for service in your tip, which gets bigger as you rack up your total bill.

If, instead of spending so much on eating out, you put $3,000 annually into a 401(k) from age 30 to age 65 and earned a 7% annual return, you'd end up with a nest egg of $414,710 -- justby redirecting your dining out budget. And, that's a conservative estimate for how much you could save over time, since eating out expenses have been shown to increase by a few hundred dollars every year.

How can you save on eating out?

Giving up eating out entirely would obviously allow you to maximize your savings -- but you also want to be able to enjoy life. You don't have to entirely give up eating out in order to avoid spending regrets, but there are ways you can cut your costs so you can put more of your money into savings instead of into your stomach. Sometimes you can't avoid a meal out, like if a loved one is celebrating something you can't bear to miss. So use the below tips to minimize your dining out costs without suffering:

Skip convenience meals : Many people buy lunch at work or pick up takeout on the way home not because they enjoy the meals but because it's more convenient. Skip these expenditures and save your dining out dollars for meals you savor by making a plan in advance. You could make extra food when you cook and freeze it so you always have a meal available at home on days you don't feel like cooking, or can dedicate your Sunday to meal prep, so you can take your lunch and breakfast to work on busy mornings. Having an intentional plan in place means you won't reach for the closest or most convenient prepared food as soon as the hunger pangs stike.

Opt for late lunch instead of dinner: Many restaurants have a similar lunch menu to their dinner menu but at reduced prices. You can opt for a nice, relaxing late lunch instead of dining out late in the evening when prices rise.

Do take out instead of delivery or dining out: You can avoid being on the hook for tipping your server by picking up your dinner, rather than going for a sit down meal. Food delivery also gets expensive with fees and tips, so take a look at how much you're spending on Postmates, Uber Eats or Grubhub.

By following these tips, you can still enjoy the occasional dining out experience -- without being left with lingering spending regrets.

Make changes today to avoid spending regrets tomorrow

Don't be one of the many Americans who regret dining out because they wish they'd put more money into their 401(k) instead. You can make changes today by adjusting your budget so you don't end up with these regrets yourself.

Budget a reasonable amount for dining out, then move some of the cash you save into your retirement accounts so you'll have more money for a brighter future. Pay yourself first to kill the temptation to eat up the money that should be saved.",This Is What Americans Regret Spending Money on the Most
It's a wolf. ,https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/watch-firefighter-rescue-dog-stranded-in-frozen-river-7802779/,"It’s not unusual for pet dogs to run away from their owners during their regular walks just to have some fun. However, one adventurous labradoodle ran away and jumped into a frozen river. Luckily, thanks to a kind firefighter, the canine was rescued in time.

The recently-adopted dog called Lucy got away from its owner and somehow got into the icy waters of the Detroit River in Michigan. Although the pooch didn’t drown, it barely managed to climb onto a chunk of ice, drifting away on the river in the freezing cold.

In a joint operation, Wyandotte Police department, the fire department and the animal control rushed to help bring her out safely. Braving the severe cold, the rescuer donning orange insulated wetsuits was finally able to bring her near the bank using a catchpole. A video of the first responder was shared by the Wyandotte Police department on Facebook later.

“The rescuer did this while standing on a slippery ladder that was submerged in the river while his co-workers held onto him via a rope. Truly an amazing and awesome rescue,” the police department wrote explaining the risks.

“She just had those big brown eyes, and she couldn’t talk, but she probably was just so grateful,” Wyandotte Assistant Fire Chief Tom Lyon told The Detroit Press talking about the “happy outcome”.

Wyandotte Deputy Police Chief Archie Hamilton said it was the neighbours who spotted the pet drifting on the icy water and alerted 911. “If not for that the dog would have froze to death or drowned,” Hamilton added.

Hamilton also added that the police officers “considered calling the US Coast Guard — and even going into the freezing water themselves” but when the firefighters showed up, they made a plan to get the poor animal out safely.

The heart-warming effort of the forces delighted all online, as the video spread on social media across the world.",Watch: Firefighter rescue dog stranded on floating chunk of ice in frozen river
Water. ,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-best-foods-to-eat-in-morning,"Breakfast is a great way to start your day. While some people prefer to skip breakfast, others need a source of energy to get going. If you enjoy breakfast, choosing nutritious foods may provide long-lasting energy and keep you full for hours. These foods are typically high in fiber, protein, healthy fats, and micronutrients. While it’s best to avoid unhealthy options that are high in sugar, refined carbs, and additives, it’s not always easy to know what to choose. As such, the list below will help you build a healthy breakfast. Here are 12 of the best foods and drinks to enjoy in the morning. Share on Pinterest Jeremy Pawlowski/Stocksy United

1. Eggs Eggs make a simple, nutritious breakfast choice. They’re an excellent source of protein, which helps support muscle synthesis. Since protein takes a while to digest, it also helps keep you feeling full ( 1 , 2 ). In one study, people given eggs and toast for breakfast reported significantly less hunger than those given bran cereal, suggesting that the egg group’s higher protein intake — 25 grams versus 11 grams — promoted greater fullness ( 3 ). Furthermore, the egg group ate fewer calories at lunch, suggesting that this dish may support weight management ( 3 ). Additionally, egg yolks contain lutein and zeaxanthin. These antioxidants help prevent eye disorders like cataracts and macular degeneration ( 4 , 5 ). Eggs are also one of the best sources of choline, a vital nutrient for brain and liver health ( 6 ). Contrary to popular belief, eggs don’t raise cholesterol levels in most people despite their high cholesterol content. In fact, one review of 23 studies found that eggs have a mild protective effect against heart disease ( 7 ). That said, try to limit your intake of highly processed breakfast items that are commonly paired with eggs, such as breakfast sausages and bacon. Instead, eat your eggs with other nutritious foods, such as whole grain toast, whole fruit, or sautéed vegetables. Summary Eggs are high in protein and several important nutrients. They may promote fullness and help lower your calorie intake later in the day.

2. Greek yogurt Greek yogurt is a great option if you’re looking for a quick breakfast. It’s made by straining whey and other liquid from milk curds, which produces a creamy product that’s more concentrated in protein than regular yogurt ( 8 ). In addition, it’s lower in calories than other protein sources. A 1-cup (245-gram) serving boasts 25 grams of protein and only 149 calories ( 9 ). Plus, Greek yogurt is full of beneficial nutrients like calcium, vitamin B12, zinc, potassium, and phosphorus ( 9 ). Certain types are good sources of probiotics like Bifidobacteria, which support your digestion. To make sure that your yogurt contains probiotics, look for the phrase “contains live and active cultures” on the label ( 10 , 11 ). If you prefer an even creamier, higher protein product, Icelandic yogurt — known as skyr — is another great option. Try topping Greek yogurt with berries or chopped fruit to add more fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Summary Greek yogurt is not only high in protein and low in calories, but certain types are also high in probiotics, which support gut health.

3. Coffee Aside from water, coffee is the world’s most popular beverage. Approximately 85% of Americans drink coffee on a regular basis ( 12 ). It’s high in caffeine, a molecule that promotes alertness, improves mood, and increases physical and mental performance. Notably, many athletes drink coffee as a natural pre-workout beverage to support sports performance ( 12 , 13 ). It also contains other beneficial compounds, such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and diterpenes, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties ( 14 , 15 ). In fact, regular coffee intake is associated with many health benefits, such as a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, liver disease, Parkinson’s, certain types of cancer, and even death from all causes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). Most studies suggest that 1–3 cups (240–710 mL) per day — containing about 300–400 mg of caffeine — provide these benefits. Although this amount is safe for adults, you should limit yourself to 300 mg or less of caffeine per day if you’re pregnant ( 12 ). Finally, it’s best to drink your coffee black or with dairy or plant-based milk. Try to use sugar sparingly or avoid it altogether, as too much sugar is linked to health risks. Summary The caffeine in coffee promotes alertness and enhances physical and mental performance. Drinking coffee regularly is associated with a lower risk of illnesses.

4. Oatmeal Oatmeal is a classic breakfast option — and it’s nutritious to boot. It’s made from rolled or steel cut oats, which contain a unique fiber called beta glucan. This soluble fiber not only helps reduce cholesterol levels but also promotes feelings of fullness by delaying stomach emptying and triggering the release of peptide YY, a fullness hormone that may prevent overeating ( 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ). Plus, oats are a good source of iron, B vitamins, manganese, magnesium, zinc, and selenium ( 22 ). They also contain around 10 grams of protein per cup (81 grams). To boost the protein content, make oatmeal with milk instead of water, mix in some protein powder, or serve it with a side of eggs ( 22 ). Keep in mind that oats don’t contain gluten but are often processed alongside gluten-containing grains, which increases the risk of cross contamination ( 23 ). Therefore, people with gluten-related disorders should choose oats that have been certified gluten-free. Summary Oatmeal is rich in beta glucan, a type of fiber that may lower cholesterol levels and increase feelings of fullness. It also contains many vitamins and minerals.

5. Chia seeds Chia seeds are extremely nutritious and a great source of fiber. In fact, just 1 ounce (28 grams) provides an impressive 10 grams of fiber per serving ( 24 ). What’s more, a portion of this fiber is soluble, meaning that it absorbs water and increases the volume of food moving through your digestive tract. In turn, this process helps you feel full ( 25 , 26 , 27 ). One small study gave participants either plain yogurt or yogurt with 7 or 14 grams of chia seeds. Both chia seed groups observed significantly more fullness, less hunger, and reduced overall food intake than the plain yogurt group ( 28 ). Another study found that eating chia seeds led to significantly reduced hunger compared with flaxseeds. Although both seeds are highly nutritious, the gelling properties of chia seeds may be responsible ( 29 ). These seeds’ high soluble fiber may likewise help stabilize blood sugar levels and support heart health ( 30 , 31 ). Though chia seeds aren’t high in protein, you can eat them with high protein foods, such as Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or a protein shake. This chia pudding recipe packs 25 grams of protein, for example. High protein chia pudding recipe Share on Pinterest Martí Sans/Stocksy United Ingredients 1 ounce (28 grams) of dry chia seeds

1 scoop (25 grams) of whey protein powder

1 cup (240 mL) of coconut milk or almond milk

1/2 cup (74 grams) of berries

stevia or another sweetener to taste, if desired Directions Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well.

Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Summary Chia seeds are high in fiber, which may help promote fullness and reduce hunger levels.

6. Berries Berries — including blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries — are delicious and packed with antioxidants. Most are high in fiber, which promotes fullness. In fact, raspberries and blackberries each provide an impressive 8 grams of fiber per cup (123–144 grams) ( 32 , 33 ). Plus, 1 cup (123–144 grams) of berries contains only 50–85 calories depending on the type ( 32 , 33 , 34 ). Berries also offer antioxidants called anthocyanins, which provide their characteristic blue, purple, and red colors. A diet high in anthocyanins is linked to reduced inflammation and a lower risk of illnesses like heart disease and certain types of cancer ( 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 ). Additionally, anthocyanins are associated with better brain health and may protect against age-related mental decline ( 39 , 40 ). You can purchase berries year-round either fresh or frozen. Add them to Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, oatmeal, or a fruit smoothie for a tasty breakfast. Summary Berries are high in fiber and low in calories. They’re also rich in antioxidants that may decrease your risk of disease.

7. Cottage cheese Cottage cheese is a fantastic high protein breakfast item, packing an impressive 24 grams of protein per cup (220 grams) ( 41 ). A high protein breakfast is linked to greater fullness and reduced hunger. In fact, one study found cottage cheese to be as filling and satisfying as eggs ( 42 ). Cottage cheese is also low in calories, providing only 180 calories per cup (220 grams). Therefore, it may support weight loss without leaving you feeling hungry ( 41 ). In fact, one review associated a diet high in dairy products, especially high protein foods, with greater weight loss ( 43 ). You can eat cottage cheese with many other nutritious foods, such as berries, peaches, tomatoes, cucumbers, chia seeds, flaxseeds, or granola. Summary Cottage cheese is high in protein, which may help keep you full and reduce hunger. Common breakfast toppings include fresh fruit, veggies, seeds, and granola.

8. Whole wheat toast Share on Pinterest James Ransom/Offset Images If you prefer a simple breakfast in the morning, give whole wheat toast a try. Whole grain toast is high in fiber and complex carbs, which digest slowly and don’t rapidly raise blood sugar levels ( 44 , 45 ). You can spread any number of nutritious toppings on whole wheat toast, including: fried eggs and tomatoes

avocado and chili flakes

peanut butter and banana

cottage cheese and strawberries

sliced figs and honey

tuna

sliced turkey or chicken

baked beans

egg salad For extra fiber and protein, try sprouted grain bread, 2 slices of which provide around 8 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein ( 46 ). Summary Whole wheat toast is a good source of fiber. Plus, you can top it with a wide variety of nutritious spreads.

9. Nuts Nuts of all types are high in magnesium, potassium, and heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. They’re also a great source of antioxidants ( 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ). Brazil nuts are one of the best sources of selenium. Just 2 Brazil nuts provide more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) ( 51 ). Although nuts are high in calories, studies suggest you don’t absorb all of their fat. For example, some studies show that your body only absorbs about 129 calories from a 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of whole almonds, though you absorb more fat from processed versions, such as almond butter ( 52 , 53 ). Another study notes that your body only absorbs 80% of the calories from almonds and walnuts ( 54 ). Furthermore, nuts’ high protein, fat, and fiber contents promote fullness, which may aid weight management ( 50 , 55 , 56 ). Nut intake is also linked to better heart and brain health. In fact, one study associated eating peanuts and tree nuts 2 or more times per week and walnuts 1 or more times per week with a 13–19% reduced risk of heart disease ( 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 ). Topping Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or oatmeal with a spoonful or two of chopped nuts is a great way to increase your breakfast’s nutritional value. Summary Nuts are a filling, nutrient-dense food that may help reduce heart disease risk and promote brain health.

10. Green tea Green tea is a soothing drink to get you going in the morning. It contains caffeine, which improves alertness and mood. One cup (240 mL) provides only 35–70 mg of caffeine, which is about half the amount in the same serving of coffee ( 62 ). It’s also high in L-theanine, a compound that promotes a calming effect and may reduce the “jitters” linked to caffeine intake. It may also improve mood and reduce anxiety ( 63 ). Finally, green tea provides epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant that protects against chronic ailments like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and mental decline. It may also have a mild effect on metabolism, though more research is needed ( 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 ). Summary Green tea contains caffeine, as well as an antioxidant called EGCG, which is tied to a reduced risk of chronic disease and better brain health.

11. Protein shakes If you’re short on time or want to take your breakfast on the go, protein shakes or smoothies are a great option. Many types of protein powder exist, but whey and pea protein are the most common. Protein is important for many bodily functions, such as enzymatic reactions, maintaining and building muscle mass, and supporting healthy skin and hair. Plus, protein promotes fullness and reduces hunger ( 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 ). Additionally, a protein shake makes a great post-workout meal. Eating a large meal after a workout may be hard on your stomach, but drinking a protein shake may be easier on your stomach while still providing ample protein and nutrients for post-workout recovery ( 73 , 74 ). For a well-rounded breakfast, add a scoop of protein powder to a smoothie made with banana, frozen fruit, and milk or water. Summary It’s easy to whip up a protein shake or smoothie in a few minutes and take it on the go. Plus, this simple breakfast makes a great post-workout option.

12. Fruit Share on Pinterest Tatjana Zlatkovic/Stocksy United If you don’t want a full meal but still crave a bite to eat in the morning, try fruit. All fruits are relatively low in calories and contain good amounts of fiber and simple sugars. The fiber in fruit helps slow your body’s absorption of its sugars, giving you a steady source of energy ( 75 ). Depending on the type of fruit, you’ll also get various vitamins and minerals. For example, many fruits — including oranges, guava, kiwi, strawberries, papaya, acerola cherries, and lychee — are high in vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant and plays a key role in skin health ( 76 ). Other fruits like bananas, oranges, cantaloupe, papaya, and mango are high in potassium ( 76 ). Furthermore, fruits provide an array of polyphenol compounds and antioxidants depending on their color. For instance, guava is high in lycopene while purple plums pack anthocyanins. This is why it’s important to eat fruits of various colors ( 76 , 77 ). Research indicates that eating whole fruit may offer numerous benefits, such as a decreased risk of heart disease and cancer, lower rates of depression and poor mental health, healthy aging, and better gut health ( 78 , 79 , 80 ). Since fruit juice lacks fiber and is less likely to keep you full, it’s best to stick with whole fruit most often ( 81 ). For a balanced breakfast, pair fruit with high protein foods, such as eggs, Greek yogurt, or cottage cheese. Summary Eating a variety of fruits provides you with different vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. What’s more, most fruits contain high amounts of fiber that may promote fullness and keep your blood sugar levels stable.",12 of the Healthiest Foods to Eat for Breakfast
The car didn't make it to the street. ,https://drive23.com/technology/the-end-result-of-using-flex-seal-as-engine-oil/,"

p Being creative and innovative can be a great thing but it can also spark in one’s mind some ideas that may seem a little wacky to others. The question is always if to try them or not. This group of guys did not stop themselves from trying out their craziest ideas. They went for it, without holding back. They managed to turn the idea into reality. These guys saw flex seal and thought “wow this would be great to try in a car engine instead of oil”, well this isn’t a regular thought that goes through most people’s minds. Flex seal is just a bonding product meant to glue things why would anyone want to put it in the car? Sounds a little out there. Meet this crew of men that their sole passion in life is running experiments on cars with the constant risk of damaging them completely. So what was their result this time with the flex seal as engine oil? What they found was very entertaining. The crew Before diving into the crux of this story, let’s say a little about the stars in this story. These folks are car enthusiasts residing in Seattle, Washington. And like we said they have a passion for messing with cars. Why? Because it is fun, that’s why. Orion Dajnowicz, as shown in the image (on the right) headed the group. Orion performs a series of crazy experiments with cars, which he shares on his YouTube channel @ Life OD. His experiments with cars more often result in a wild scenario. Hence, it’s recommended that no one tries them out at home. Aside from being known for his crazy experiment with cars, he is also popular in the racing world. He is a promising young fella with exceptional driving skill.



Fill up the car After Orion and his group properly planned the experiment, they head out to get the essential resources, flex seal. The group would need a lot of flex seal for this experiment. So, they head to the best place where the dream of delightful purchase dwells, Walmart. Here, they had to stock up several cans of flex seal. The store employees must have looked at them and thought “who would need so much flex seal”. They grabbed pretty much all that was left on the shelf and headed out to do something that was probably going to ruin their car forever. The guys were great at hyping each other up and were just so excited to get the experiment going.



Sounds sticky So what exactly is so risky about using flex seal as engine oil. Let’s see what this substance is all about. Flex seal is a product that is used for bonding together with different materials. Pretty much a very strong glue. The commercial states it can literally stop water from flowing out of a bucket, stating that nothing can beat or get through flex seal. How is this supposed to help run a car? The product uses the concept of liquid rubber to adhere to things together. This product also comes with warnings on how to use it and we don’t think pouring down in an engine sounds safe. Sounds sticky…sounds tricky but these guys are all about tricks. The warnings did not stop them from trying this experiment out.



The test dummy It is not enough to have all the flex seal at hand the experiment likewise needed a car to be able to be complete. The group sorted out the perfect car for the experiment. Since they were aware of the impending odds that may arise in their experiment, they had to use a car that was already half-dead and of purpose to their experiment. They opted for a car with diverse knotty issues such as leaking problems and a broken door. They weren’t going to risk their own working and expensive vehicles for this experiment. But still damaging a half working car was still a risk. What if it would blow up or catch on fire? The excitement continued to grow and they carried on.



The door goes up This car was so worn down the door actually had to opened upward instead of sideways as a normal car door would open. This was a nice joke for the crew, who played with the door and laughed about it. This car was not working properly so it was perfect for the flex seal experiment. The men in the video really didn’t care that this car was breaking down, they were willing to damage it even more. At this moment the only thing they cared about one thing- getting the flex seal to actually work. So now it was go time. Open up the engine boys!



Leakproof for sure It was a matter of time before the experiment commenced. A member of the group chimed in and said that there would be an absolute solution to the leaking problem of the car. “It would never leak again that’s for sure”, he said. In summary, they proposed that the flex seal would form a shield inside the engine. So they weren’t too hopeful it was actually going to work but they wanted to see what was to happen. As a member rightly said, “We would bulletproof it from the inside, not the outside.” A bulletproof engine doesn’t sound to use at all. But these guys were here for the fun and for the thrill of doing strange experiments.



First impressions Once they saw the content in the flex seal, it gave them reassurance of their earlier speculations. Orion admitted that it was his first time of seeing the sealer in person. He’d seen all the sappy commercials on tv it always made him laugh, but he didn’t think it would actually look like this. Nevertheless, after examining the content time without number he became optimistic that it would not only work as a sealer but also serve as oil. This only made them more pumped because maybe it would not only seal the engine but actually get it to run for a bit before drying completely.



Guessing game “I say it goes 23 miles,” one crew member predicted when they were talking about the distance of the car. The guys chimed in as well. Not only did the group predicted that the flex sealer would work perfectly as oil, but also expected it to cover up a specific distance. Orion, considering the state of the machine and being positive, replied that it would go 5 miles. Chau, the other guy with his cap put on backward proposed that it will cover up 10 miles. But only once they went for it they would know who was right. How far would this thing actually go?



Satisfaction Now, all things are set. They began to pour the flex seal into the engine oil vessel. On seeing the dark goopy, gooey fluid as it flows into the car, they became aroused. “Oooohs” and “Ahhhs” were heard from the guys who huddled around the engine watch. It felt more like a magical sensation, like nothing seen before. The group supposed that the stuff was gross and that it was a crazy thing to put such a thick viscous fluid into a car. Orion said, “It’s so thick!” Mariner assured the group that it was going to be great and that it was the thickest kind of oil to put into anyone’s motor.



No doubt Someone in the group sees the flex seal as prospective ‘race oil’. A member in the group added that it would be for a turbo application. In addition, it will never blow a motor because it is capable of sealing it up so good. They kept their confidence that it would do the most and solve all the problems. But where they getting to excited over nothing? Flex seal end result is a rubberlike coating with heavy thickness. It is popularly regarded as an exceptional sealer for household products, farming products among many other things. Now, it seems more like a solution to the leaking problem of the car. Could it be they made a discovery if this would work?



Fun with the Goop The group had to pour in a number of flex seals into the oil tank. The intention was to fill it up. The goop was so thick that it flowed slowly into the tank. It was taking a lot of time. Since they were just trying this out, had fun with the goop discharge despite being slow. The guys enjoy each other’s company as they make funny remarks and observations. To others this may seem like a complete waste of time but they were having fun and waiting for the big moment when they would turn those keys and start the car.



Berky bringing everyone down At last, they were set to go. They had poured all of the flex seal content into the tank. Now, the group was large, but only three of them—Orion, Mariner and Chau— had made forecasts on the outcome of their investigation. Saying it would start and even drive a certain distance. They asked a fourth companion, Berky if he has any projection on the outcome of the experiment. Berky said frankly that it would seize up the car and it would be done with for good. Though it was a pessimistic remark, it was the final faith of all the other guys anyway.



All systems in Place Mariner said, “She’s ready to rip”.Now that everything is set, they imagined what the outcome of their test would be. That was certainly blunt, but the guys hope for a different result. One of them, therefore, jumped into the car and turned on the ignition. On ignition, the engine made a sound that indicated it was ready to go. Then, Orion said with excitement, “She’s going!” Although the car was ready to go, the guys still need some time to observe. Hence, they positively listen to the vehicle to see if it was now working with the flex seal. Could it be they had come up to some creative genius hack?



Previous Experiments The flex seal experiment was not the first. They had done similar things in the past that had yielded posited outcomes. For instance, they filled their tires with water, made car tires out of zip ties, and using WD-40 for a car instead of engine oil. These guys just seem to love taking risks and trying crazy things, being spontaneous and adventurous is their way of life. They are just trying to have fun and enjoy themselves.



Coffee In The Engine – Something is brewing The guys set out on another similar experiment to the flex seal using a very common beverage, maybe something some people call their “human fuel”. That is of course coffee. We drink coffee every day to get our selves going and feel awake. Could it be this caffeine would get a car to work? Well these guys went out and tried just that, again not really caring what the result is but just for the fun of it. They could do it so why not. How do you think this turned out? What would work this or flex seal?



To go please The guys entered their local coffee shop and got a good amount of large espresso and black coffee drinks. The more the better. They told the employees at the shop that they were going to put the coffee drinks in a car engine and the employees were very confused, because who would just do that. The guys paid for the drinks and got on their way.



Pour it up They got back to their car and experiment area and started pouring slowly the hot coffee down the engine tube. The coffee was hot and steaming and the guys kept getting excited. Would it work, would it not? Every time they tried something crazy like this they would never know the end result. They kept pouring till all the cups were empty and then it was showtime. Rev up the engine!



Child’s play-The Lego Experiment- Before getting to the results of these experiments let’s take a quick look at some playful and less dangerous attempts these guys went for. In another entertaining experiment, the guys set out to make a functional tire from legos. And this actually worked pretty well. Obviously, they could not drive far way with this tire but it managed to turn and be driven just a little bit out of the shop. Who knew a toy could make an actual real tire? Tires are expensive maybe this can be a hack to save money. But it seems the flex seal oil experiment would be one of the most extreme and dangerous attempts of this crew.



The Strenght Of Flex Seal – People’s Previous Experiments It seems not only the Life OD guys took an interest in flex seal. People online seem to love to test the product to see if it really is as strong as it says it is in the commercial. For example, this guy tried all the forms of flex seal and tested it with water leaks even covered eggs to see if they would break. In his video that was posted online, it seemed the product didn’t quite work. But the fascination with this product continues. So how did it turn out on the car engine?!



Coffee In The Engine- Steamy but not in a good way Hmm maybe you like your coffee hot but it seems a car and its engine does not! The car immediately started smoking and coffee steam was coming out of the engine. The guys were entertained but the car was not quite doing its thing. This didn’t seem like it was going to actually work. Maybe people should stick to drinking coffee.



Pick Me Up?! Coffee Doesn’t Give Cars Energy Well, it didn’t take long and this car experiment was also done. The car had died. It didn’t approve of the coffee. Again maybe they should just stick to drinking coffee, that sounds so much safer. The car did not explode but continued to let out smoke and a very strange painful noise. Once again the crew went on to destroy the vehicle by riding a scooter on it and jumping on it as usual.



What Sound Does Flex Seal Oil Make? Back to the flex seal results, it was now flowing through the engine and the guys waited….the sound produced by the engine was a bit strange. That was not the issue, for the car was half-dead in the first place. Berky asked if the way it sounded was the way it was before. The group did not blame the sound on the flex seal. It may be as a result of the car’s fault. So, they concluded that the flex seal was working well at the moment, and it was now time to take it to the street. Orion said that they should drive it to see. To be optimistic, Berky said it was a good sign that the engine was already circulating the flex seal. Could he be wrong?



Don’t get excited An unexpected turn of events happened just as they were about to move the car to the street. The engine has been circulating for over 20 seconds. As soon as they tried moving the car, it stopped making a sound. The group couldn’t imagine what had transpired. A car just doesn’t stop that way. They wondered if there was a sort of mistake in the process of the experiment.



Stand the heat The group looked at each other with their heart in freeze-beats and their jaws down to their chest. They couldn’t believe their eyes. The experiment they longed hoped would bring a positive result ended in a deadlock. They could only laugh at the circumstances. Was that the verdict? Berky was right all along. The car just grasped up without taking a step forward. Since Mariner, Chau and Orion had predicted that the car would cover 23, 10 and 5 miles respectively, Berky won in the prediction. The guys were still not ready to give up that easily. There was still a chance to prove Berky wrong.



Round two flex seal oil The group was not ready to give up. They had the intent of proving Berky wrong. So, they tried to revive the car once again. The guy in the car revved the engine again. It worked fine for some seconds. The engine made a noise for a while and then it started to die. Orion, in particular, was not ready to give up at this time. He initiated another plan in dealing with the status quo.



Round 2.5 flex seal oil Orion laid out a plan B. He spelled out the plan: instead of revving the engine, the driver should ‘Gas’ on starting the car. The young driver in the car did as Orion instructed. This time, the car began to make some noise. It shows promising signs in the first place. The driver applied more gas twice the number of Orion’s exclamation, “Gas it!” The car pulsated for more than 5 seconds and then shuts down. Oh this was not going to work.



You win some, you lose some This was not the outcome they wanted with the flex seal. Though they were having a nice time in the experiment, laughing and goofing off they all understood this was a fail, the car was done with for good. So, The group set for yet another plan of action following the idea of Orion. One last shot! This one was just not giving them the result as expected. Their major point to prove was that the flex seal can be a replacement for engine oil. However, this was not the case. They thought they would be able to know what happens, after all they are all really good with cars and have lots of knowledge about cars.



Extra-Energy Boost This was the last shot to turn this experiment around. After this trial, the group may just call it to quits. It was already getting to the point that Berky was the grand master in the prediction. Even Orion commended Berky by saying, “It looks like you’re about to win this one.” In as much as there is still an idea, Orion was not ready to give in—at least not at the moment. The group had one last trial before admitting that Berky won. This idea could solve the problem. Part of the idea was to add more battery power to the car. Orion told Mariner that they would use his truck to jump up the power battery.



Batteries don’t help The group connected the flex seal car with Mariner’s truck with a jumper cable. They hoped that this would make the experiment work. They turned on the car but the engine started shaking violently. Using the skills as applied in the previous test, the car seemed to be working perfectly. Soon, within a short while, just like before, it developed a heart attack and died instantly. Now, it seemed like they had to pull out the white flag.



Berky the winner The group officially accepted defeat. Berky was now the winner. Nevertheless, as they looked at the bottom of the car, they found something strange. The flex seal was leaking out at the bottom of the car. That was a sign of the end of their quest. In conclusion, Orion gave a finishing comment on Berky’s victory by saying, “Now this is it, it’s officially dead, and it is officially leaking flex seal out of the bottom…” He even said that the group would have to treat Berky to a very nice chicken dinner that night.



Dealing with the result The group now acknowledged the facts that flex seal couldn’t replace engine oil of a leaking car. In fact, this one had destroyed the poor car. More damage than good! Hence, there was a need to set the car free from its bondage. They set to drain out the flex seal from the car. In a way, this was more fun for the group. Orion lamented that the stuff was so thick and it might take a while to drain it off completely. The group hoped that once the entire flex seal was out of the car, they would be able to get it to work.



When to give up While the drain off was still on, the guys gave it a try once more. They turned on the ignition hoping that it would work properly this time. Again, the engine sputtered for some seconds under immense pressure. Unfortunately, the car didn’t come on this time. By this time, they were certain that the car was now fully dead. Berky announced the time of death by saying, “There she went”, while Orion seconded with a wow!



Just too thick Mariner asked what lesson the group had learned in the exercise. Orion replied, “Flex seal literally ruins it. It’s too thick.” Why would anyone put in such an effort on something that may not produce a positive result? That the beauty of adventure. These guys put in all their effort in any experiment not minding the outcome. Success or failure, they still couldn’t leave their ideas on paper. In addition, they have other ideas yet ‘untamed’.



Reviewing the Concoction If they must execute the plan, they have to recycle the flex seal. They retrieved the used flex seal drained from the car and analyzed it for the next line of action. In trying to analyze the drained flex seal, they found out that the constituent contains little amount of gas. In other to understand what the concoction constituted, they need to examine it physically.



Good to Go A member in the group asked Orion to dip a stick into the concoction. When he noticed that the stick interacted with the concoction, the group was surprised. Orion said that they could honestly be flex-sealing tools with the leftover flex seal, the concoction. This statement implied that the flex seal was useful for other stuff even if it didn’t work as engine oil. Even as at that, they weren’t contented with the number of failures obtained—there is still a chance.



Again?! The plan was to jump start the car and pour in the recycled flex seal into the car slowly while it was running. That was what these geniuses did. The group struggled to jumpstart the car. The leader of the group, Orion started pouring the recycled flex seal into the car, a risky move. The group waited anxiously for the outcome, thirsting for adventure. ‘There had been countless failures, but it might probably work out just fine’, so they thought.



Damaging hour Negative! The outcome of their final struggle ended up in a dead end. It was more devastating than the previous trials. Chau said, “It’s a failure.” At this junction, they all concur to the fact that the car was truly dead. The group was prepared for the worst. They knew something of such magnitude might occur in the long run. The car was pretty much disposable as well. So, to get the fun rolling, they had to entertain themselves and the audience.



The Thirst for Destruction Nothing can deliver the car by this time. It was totally dead, as dead as a rock. The group decided to kick, punch and do all sort of thing in a way to further destroy the car. This is the best way to get the hand, legs and entire body busy as well as giving back to the car for disappointing them. Orion said that they should give in their best shot in the process. Chau gave the side mirror a massive kick while Berky body-slammed the top like he was wrestling an opponent in the WWE SmackDown Live.



Be a pro If someone is going to do these crazy experiments we would warn them to be careful. These guys were messing with an actual engine and things could have gone a lot worse. Something could have caused a fire or other hazards and they were very professional about it is they do it all the time. So the entertainment is at its peak but the danger exists, so be aware of that.



As seen on TV So where did these guys get the inspo to use flex seal? Well if you haven’t viewed the commercial this might be the first time you heard of this product but it has an impressive commercial that looked too good to be true and had people questioning just how strong this product was. The commercial used very convincing salesmen who showed the success of the product. The product also has a tape form that apparently can stop a very severe leak.",The end result of using Flex Seal as engine oil
Families with children. ,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/21/this-group-of-americans-will-most-likely-get-the-biggest-tax-refunds-experts-say.html,"A handful of early tax filers are seeing unexpectedly low refunds, or worse, owing money to the IRS. But not everyone is in for an unpleasant surprise. Many people are watching this tax season more closely than usual because it's the first time the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is in effect for a full tax year. The new law, passed in December 2017, enacted a number of broad changes. It introduced new tax brackets, included an expanded child care credit and changed the way itemized deductions are factored in, for example. Unfortunately, 28 percent of Americans don't understand exactly what's different, and almost half have no idea how the changes affect their tax bracket. Adding to that confusion, refunds dropped 8.7 percent over the first two weeks of filing season, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Plus, the IRS is processing returns at a slower pace than usual, in large part due to the 35-day partial government shutdown. ""The law is so different, we may have a different pattern than in the past,"" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, tells CNBC Make It. ""This is not a normal year."" But while some Americans may see lower refunds, most tax experts expect the refund rate to stabilize. And for some, their tax refunds will be higher this year.

Families with kids will likely see the biggest refund

Those with children still living at home may see a bigger refund this year, Lynn Ebel, director at The Tax Institute at H&R Block, tells CNBC Make It. Especially if they live in low-tax states such as Texas, Washington and Wyoming. ""Families with children under 17, especially those who claim the standard deduction in 2017 and will claim it in 2018, are most likely to get a refund bigger than anticipated,"" Ebel says.

The child tax credit is a great boost for young families with children. Harlene Stevens CPA with accounting firm Nisivoccia LLP

Under the new law, families can deduct up to $2,000 per qualifying child, up from $1,000 previously. These are credits, so if you tax bill is $10,000 and you qualify for the maximum credit, your bill goes down to $8,000. Plus, up to $1,400 of the child tax credit is refundable this year. So even if you don't owe any money to the IRS, you can get that money back as a refund. ""The child tax credit is a great boost for young families with children,"" Harlene Stevens, a CPA with accounting firm Nisivoccia LLP, tells CNBC Make It. There's also a new, non-refundable $500 credit for other qualifying dependents who may not otherwise meet the requirements for the larger child tax credit. For example, if you have college-age children under 23 who are still living at home, or if you are supporting grandchildren, you can claim the credit. However, Ebel notes if you don't have children or dependents and you itemized your deductions in 2017, and plan to do the same in 2018, you will likely see a smaller refund. This set of Americans ""are one of the groups most at risk of owing instead of getting a refund,"" she says.

Look beyond just your refund

Lisa Greene-Lewis, a TurboTax expert and CPA, tells CNBC Make It that it's important to look at your total tax picture, and not just the refund. Many people are expecting to see more money in their pocket because five of seven tax rates have been lowered. But Green-Lewis says whether you see a bigger refund depends on your personal tax situation and if you appropriately adjusted your W-4 withholdings in 2018. An estimated 20 percent of taxpayers did not withhold enough throughout the year, Barry Kleiman, a CPA and principal at the tax firm Untracht Early, tells CNBC Make It. ""The majority of taxpayers who usually take the standard deduction may see more money in their pocket, but this does not necessarily mean it will show up in their refund; it could have shown up in their paycheck last year, their tax refund, or as a lower tax balance due,"" Greene-Lewis says. A single person making $50,000 per year, for example, would see a tax savings of $2,640 under the new standard deduction amount, as opposed to the $1,587.50 in savings under the old system.

Show Caption Hide Caption What is chronic wasting disease? CWD is an always-fatal disease that leaves their brains full of holes. What is this always-fatal condition and how do people fight its spread? Wochit-All

As people wonder what might happen if humans eat meat from ""zombie"" deer, there is at least one group of people who already know.

On March 13, 2005, a fire company in Oneida County, New York, fed the meat of a deer that tested positive for chronic wasting disease to 200 to 250 people. The company didn't know the meat was from a diseased deer. Laboratory tests for one of the deer served came back positive for CWD later.

Because little was known about what happens to people who eat infected meat, the Oneida County Health Department monitored the group's health through a surveillance project. About 80 people who ate the venison agreed to participate. Together with the State University of New York-Binghamton, health experts checked in with the group of mostly white males over the course of six years to see whether they developed any unusual symptoms.

In a study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Public Health, researchers found the group had ""no significant changes in health conditions."" They did report eating less venison after the whole ordeal. Otherwise, observed conditions, including vision loss, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, weight changes, hypertension and arthritis, were credited to old age.

""It’s the only study I’m aware of that has this progressive follow-up of a known point source contamination where we know the people ate a contaminated animal,"" researcher Ralph Garruto, professor of biomedical and biological sciences at Binghamton University, told USA TODAY.

Garruto said his team checks in with the group every two years and plans another follow-up in spring. Though he said the chance of symptoms appearing dwindles with time, there's a small possibility that someone might show signs of the disease.

""It only takes one case,"" he said.

There have been no reported cases of CWD in humans, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state wildlife offices urge hunters to take precautions in areas where the disease has been found in animals. In laboratory studies, CWD has been able to cross species.

But some experts have predicted CWD could one day infect humans. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it's ""probable"" that humans will come down with the disease after eating meat ""in the years ahead.""

Unless you still have the Fifty Nifty United States song from elementary school memorized, you probably can’t name all 50 states in less than five minutes. If you’ve ever actually tried to list all the states from memory, you know how hard it is. You’ll most likely fly through about 40 of them and then start to struggle. And if you don’t, then test your knowledge even more with the 24 state trivia facts everyone gets wrong.

Even if you drew out the entire U.S. map, accounting for all of the tiny states in New England and remembering to sketch out both Dakotas and Kansas, there’s still one that inevitably holds the total count at 49.

Nope, it’s not Hawaii or Alaska. That state is Missouri.

The results from Sporcle’s “US States Quiz” make it clear that Missouri is the most forgotten state. The quiz has been attempted by players more than 19 million times, and Missouri is the state the lowest percent of people guess correctly. Only 77.6 percent of players manage to remember it, compared to the 97.3 percent who list California or Texas. The four most-forgotten states behind Missouri are Connecticut, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Nebraska. If you’re one of the few who remembered Missouri, try guessing the only letter that’s not in any U.S. state name.

The fact that so many people forget Missouri isn’t that surprising, though. Eight U.S. states start with the letter M—you’re bound to forget one of them. Being able to list Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Montana on your own already signals a pretty good memory.

Put yourself to the test. Do you think you can name all 50? If you’re forgetting a lot of states, don’t worry. These 50 facts about the 50 states should help you remember them all. If that doesn’t work, memorizing the lyrics to that catchy Fifty Nifty United States song should definitely do the trick. Good luck!",The U.S. State Everyone Forgets When Listing All 50

Many married couples will look back on their wedding day as one of the best days of their lives. In 2017, one man was determined to make his wedding day one that he and his wife would never forget. She Never Saw It Coming Jeff Althoff thought of an incredible idea for a wedding gift for his bride, Jenna, describing the surprise as “the wedding gift of her dreams.” When he gave the gift to Jenna at the reception, the bride was lost for words…

She Surprised Him First This story heavily focuses on the surprise that Jeff gave to Jenna on their wedding day. However, it wasn’t just the groom who had a few tricks up his sleeve. On March 4, 2017, on the morning of their big day, Jeff woke up and found a huge surprise waiting for him downstairs. It turns out that his bride Jenna had given him a pre-wedding gift – a new set of golf clubs! Jeff certainly had his work cut out for him…

He Also Had A Surprise For Her Of course, Jeff was over the moon that Jenna had given him such a thoughtful surprise gift before the big day had even gotten well and truly underway. However, the bride had no idea that Jeff also had a surprise up his sleeve. The big difference was that Jeff’s gift for Jenna would arrive after the ceremony. However, the wedding surprise was simply the culmination of a love story that had been unfolding for the last few years…

Love At First Sight In order to feel the weight and emotion of this epic wedding surprise, we need to understand the nature of Jeff and Jenna’s relationship. Based on their social media life, it appears that the couple has been together since 2013. Consistently sharing their happy moments online, Jenna and Jeff are obviously very proud of their love for one another. One thing is for sure though; you might be surprised by some of the passions that they enjoy together…

Playing Outdoors Ever since first falling in love a few years back, Jenna and Jeff have been thick as thieves and have developed some pretty interesting hobbies together. They love nothing more than being in the outdoors and performing outdoor activities such as hunting, skiing, and fishing. You might be asking yourself, “how is this relevant to the story?” Well, it turns out that their shared love for hunting is what put this remarkable story into motion, to begin with…

Unexpected Proposal One day, when Jeff took Jenna out for an impromptu hunting trip, she didn’t think too much of it. However, when she saw a professional photographer creeping up behind them, she knew that something was up. Suddenly, Jeff got down on one knee and asked Jenna for her hand in marriage. Without haste, Jenna said yes. She was more than ready to tie the knot with the man of her dreams. This was one hunting expedition that they’d never forget.

Beautiful Ceremony Fast forward a few months later and Jenna and Jeff’s big day had finally arrived. For many, the most nerve-wracking part of a bride and groom’s wedding is the actual ceremony. Everybody wants to recite their vows perfectly and to ensure that nothing gets in the way of the perfect ceremony. Thankfully for Jenna and Jeff, their ceremony was absolutely perfect. However, Jeff had more than just the ceremony on his mind. Keeping this big secret from Jenna was stressing him out a little…

Caught It All On Camera In order for them to be able to look back on this epic surprise, Jeff hired a film crew to record the entire thing. This included the behind-the-scenes footage, as well as the actual revelation later on. The video, which was eventually uploaded onto YouTube, starts with Jeff planning the surprise for his bride, Jenna. “Ok, so later tonight, I will be surprising Jenna with the wedding gift of her dreams,” Jeff said. But that was just the start…

Little Help From My Friends After announcing his plans on video, Jeff gathered his groomsmen around him and gave a little announcement to update them about his plans. It was mainly just to thank them for being by his side on his big day. “First off, I’d like to thank each and every one of you guys for being a part of my big day,” he said. “I really appreciate you guys taking the time to be here.” Then, he shared with them his plans for Jenna…

Stay Tuned! At first, Jeff referred to the surprise as “the wedding gift of her dreams.” You could tell though that the groomsmen were dying to know what the surprise was going to be. “With that being said, I’m going to tell you guys what the big surprise is,” he said. “She’s not going to know that you guys know until she sees this video later. So, are you guys ready to know it?” However, Jeff then turned around and simply said, “stay tuned!”

The Moment Of Truth So the wedding reception was in full swing and family and friends alike were enjoying the drinks and a wonderful spread of food. While Jenna was having the time of her life, she kept suspecting that Jeff had something planned. This is because he seemed extremely preoccupied. Then, when the time came for speeches, Jeff stood up, grabbed the microphone and started to speak. However, the crowd could hear it in his words that Jeff was a little nervous…

Nervous Speech There is no denying that Jeff’s speech got off to a bit of bumpy start. “First off, on behalf of both of Jen and I, we would like to thank each and every one of you for coming out and celebrating our big day,” he said. However, Jeff had a good reason as to why he was suffering from a case of the jitters. “I’m a little nervous up here right now because I’m about to give Jenna a big surprise that she doesn’t know about…”

Beautiful Bride It was at this point that Jeff asked Jenna to proceed to the front of the reception. As she walked down in her stunning lace dress, Jeff commented on her beautiful looks. “So if you could come out front here, please, thank you,” he said. “Would each and every one of you guys agree with me that she is the most beautiful bride that you guys have ever seen?” Then, Jeff decided to cut to the chase and set up his big surprise…

Special Gift While family and friends alike had been speculating that Jeff was cooking up a surprise for Jenna, the groom wanted to set the record straight, once and for all. “I’ve heard a few rumbles and a few jokes about it along the way,” he said. “But Jenna, I’ve decided to give you a wedding gift that was completely for you. No, it’s not hunting or fishing related. It’s everything that you want.” However, Jeff’s clues only seemed to get more cryptic…

Best Day Of Our Life Before making things clearer in regards to his surprise, Jeff asked his bride a puzzling question: “Would you agree with me that the last few hours have been the best hours of your life as a family of two?” Despite being slightly confused by the question, Jenna did agree with Jeff and gave him a little nod. Nevertheless, she trusted that Jeff would make things a little clearer as his speech progressed. However, his next line only made things more confusing!

Strange Announcement Hoping that Jeff would be able to dig himself out of this confusing hole he created, Jenna was surprised by the next thing that her husband said: “Well, I’m proud to announce that we have now become a family of three!” What could this possibly mean? Was she pregnant and she didn’t know about it? Soon enough though, her questions would be answered. It seems that their family and friends caught on to Jeff’s clues before the bride did…

Guests Were In Shock While Jenna tried to decipher Jeff’s cryptic hints about the surprise, many of guests had already caught a glimpse of the incredible wedding gift. As soon as they laid eyes on it, the guests started to gasp and clap with thunderous applause. Some people were so shocked that their jaws completely dropped to the ground. Jenna had no idea what was going on. However, it wouldn’t take long before Jenna also saw what all the fuss was about…

She Couldn’t Believe It Although she was still unaware of what all the fuss was about, all Jenna needed to do was turn her head and everything would make sense. So she did and in the blink of an eye, she was completely lost for words. All of the guests applauded even louder when they saw Jenna’s amazing reaction. Naturally, Jeff was absolutely delighted by his wife’s reaction. But what exactly was it that gave the bride the shock of her life?

It’s A Puppy! Lo and behold, Jeff’s surprise wedding gift for Jenna was a puppy! Overwhelmed with emotion, Jenna ran over to the adorable light-brown Labrador. Jeff picked up the little pup and softly placed him in her arms. She gave him the biggest hug and shortly after that, planted a huge smacker on Jeff! Now that Jeff’s surprise went down absolutely perfectly, everyone could enjoy the rest of the party, puppy included! However, it’s what happened next that took this story to another level…

Viral Sensation When everything was said and done, Jeff took the video of the surprise and uploaded it onto the YouTube. Not even the groom could have anticipated the love he was about to receive for the heartwarming clip. In no time at all, the video generated over 700,000 views on YouTube and also got a ton of likes on Facebook. “Amazing video, amazing gift, amazing reaction! Congratulations Jeff and Jenna!! Looked like a beautiful wedding!” one person wrote. But that wasn’t the end of this remarkable story…

Honeymoon Time! While their surprise puppy was, without a doubt, the highlight of their wedding, Jenna and Jeff would have to sideline their dog for at least a couple of weeks. This is because they wanted to go on their honeymoon. After leaving their pup in safe hands, the newlyweds embarked on a beautiful honeymoon to Saint Maarten, an island in the Caribbean. Despite enjoying every minute of their honeymoon, Jenna and Jeff were excited to return home to their beautiful puppy, “Bear.”

Family Of Three… Jenna, Jeff, and Bear acclimatized to life as a family of three in no time. Having been there literally from day one, Bear was very much family, as far as the newlyweds were concerned. Jenna documented Bear’s early years on Facebook, posting pictures of him having fun in the pool, sleeping, and exploring. Believe it or not, Bear also loves the outdoors. And just when you thought that the surprises were over, another one was just around the corner…",Groom Stuns Bride With Most Amazing Surprise Wedding Gift

Show Caption Hide Caption What is chronic wasting disease? CWD is an always-fatal disease that leaves their brains full of holes. What is this always-fatal condition and how do people fight its spread? Wochit-All

Many hunters and wildlife experts have found the latest headlines around the ""zombie"" deer disease bizarre, as they say chronic wasting disease has been around for years – and they wouldn't describe infected animals as ""zombies.""

In fact, many infected deer don't even reach the final stage of the disease, where they show symptoms (stumbling, drooling, extreme weight loss), said Lindsay Thomas Jr., director of communications for the Quality Deer Management Association, a wildlife conservation organization.

He said it's ""baffling"" to think of a deer dying from CWD as a frightening ""zombie."" He instead compares the disease to dementia, as infected animals appear more confused than threatening.

“These animals aren’t zombies,” said Bryan J. Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center. “They are ready to die. They are very sick.”

While the term could give the general public the wrong impression about CWD,

Krysten Schuler, wildlife disease ecologist and co-director at the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, said the disease is ""a big problem"" and she's glad more people are paying attention to it. People just need to be properly informed, she said.

CWD, which is fatal to all deer that contract it, was first identified in the 1960s, and is now in 24 states across the nation. It's a serious infectious disease in animals, but likely won't spark an apocalypse.

Here's why:

Many appear totally normal.

Infected deer could easily die from another cause (killed by a predator or car) before they show CWD symptoms such as drooling, listlessness and low weight, Thomas said. Deer, elk and moose with the disease might appear healthy for up to two years, as neurological symptoms develop slowly, according to the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance. Symptoms usually only show during the last few months before death.

""You cannot eyeball a deer and say if it has CWD,"" Thomas said, noting that hunters have shot infected animals, believing they are healthy, only to find out through testing that their deer has CWD.

They probably won't attack.

Deer with CWD aren't going to eat your brains. They actually have holes in their brains that might cause them to be less coordinated and have trouble walking, Thomas said. Deer in the final stage of CWD could also appear weak, and underweight.

While hunters should be aware if the disease is prominent in their area, there's no need to fear ""zombie"" deer and avoid hunting, Schuler said. If anything, people who spot a sickly deer should call local wildlife officials so that the deer can be tested, she said.

None have infected humans.

There have never been any reported cases of CWD in humans. But, studies have shown it can be transmitted to animals other than deer, moose and elk, according to the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told USA TODAY that it's possible humans could contract the disease in the future. So, it is important to take precautions in infected areas. The most likely way humans could become infected is if they eat infected deer meat, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Here are a few ways people can avoid CWD.

"Her mom paid for her college, she married a doctor, invested, and then started a business. ",https://money.com/bola-sokunbi-clever-girl-finance/,"After graduating from college in 2004, Bola Sokunbi challenged herself to save as much as possible. She had admired the way her mother became a “hustle queen,” jumping into business after staying home to raise four children, and she wanted to start laying her own financial foundation.

Working as a tech consultant in New York City from 2004 to 2008 before she was married, she managed to save 40% to 50% of her $54,000 annual salary. Sokunbi, who grew up in Austria and Nigeria, educated herself about the American retirement savings system along the way. One book that particularly influenced her was Smart Women Finish Rich by David Bach. “I read that book to shreds,” she says.

Today, Sokunbi, 36, is an influencer herself. She quit her consulting job two years ago to focus full-time on running Clever Girl Finance, her financial education site for women. She has 4-year-old twins and lives with her husband, a doctor, in Hunterdon County, N.J.

Here, she shares insights into her aggressive savings plan.

Set Your Intentions

None of Sokunbi’s friends were saving as aggressively as she was right out of college. Some were making twice what she earned and saving nothing at all. But that didn’t faze her. “For me, it was setting intentions and wanting to do it,” she says. It helped that Sokunbi didn’t have student loan debt. Her mother paid for her college education, which she began in Austria and finished in the U.S.

Another tailwind was the fact that she didn’t have much time to spend money. She travelled a lot for work during the week and began a side gig as a wedding photographer on the weekends. Not only did her two jobs take up a lot of time, but they also took care of most of her meals: her company would foot the tab for her food when she was on the road, and she’d also eat at weddings as part of her compensation. When she was left to her own devices, “I was pretty much buying ramen noodles and Coke, my guilty pleasure,” she says.

She enjoyed getting to work early and reading personal finance blogs over her breakfast of a free company bagel. She loved seeing how Mr. Money Mustache and others approached investing and calculating their income in early retirement, but she didn’t necessarily aspire to follow in their footsteps and reach FIRE, an acronym for financial independence, retire early.

Find Your True Voice

Sokunbi launched Clever Girl Finance when her twins, a girl and a boy, were one year old. She developed it on the side for a year while working full-time, often staying up until 3 a.m. “I was exhausted all the time,” she says.

But her efforts paid off. The blog earned $25,000 that first year, through a diverse revenue stream of one-on-one coaching, courses, ebooks, affiliate links and eventually, brand partnerships. Two years ago, Sokunbi quit her consulting job to focus on the business full time.

Her main audience is women of color ages 21 to about 38. She realizes that many of them grew up in houses where money was a source of silent stress, and she wants to bring the discussion out into the open. “Having the conversation is necessary,” she says.

Personal finance isn't a regular part of the curriculum in most U.S. schools, so Sokunbi has picked up the slack and educates her readers about budgets and investing. Her motto is, “no shame, no judgment.”

Invest Strategically

Sokunbi learned early on that sometimes you have to spend money to make more money. She started out photographing weddings for free to build a portfolio. She had only basic camera equipment at first, but then “every time I made money I bought a lens or a camera body,” she says.

Eventually, her camera equipment was worth about $15,000 but immediately improved the quality of her photographs and allowed her to start charging between $3,000 and $5,000 a wedding. Sokunbi’s photography income padded her savings and the income from her job, which grew to $100,000 in three and a half years.

Sokunbi reached a similar juncture with Clever Girl Finance a year ago. Realizing that she couldn’t do everything herself, she hired two part-time workers to help schedule her content and tackle other administrative tasks. Their salary is an investment, but it’s one that translates into increased revenue for the site.

Sokunbi still saves as much as she can these days. She and her husband max out their contributions to their retirement accounts and put as much as they can, currently $10,000 a year each, into their children’s 529 college savings accounts. They would like to pay their children’s tuition in full, just like Sokunbi’s mother did for her.

While she has cut back her workload a bit this summer to spend more time with her twins, Sokunbi usually spends more than 40 hours a week on Clever Girl Finance. “It’s almost like, ‘why did I quit my job again?’” she laughs. “But I love it.”

Don’t @ me…

So, if you knew that there was a way of making them even more delicious, wouldn’t you want to hear about it? You definitely would, wouldn’t you? Come on.

There’s a hack, that you may or may not already know, that means you can get the freshest fries possible.

Johnny, who runs Instagram account @cakemail, has shared a hack that is so simple, we wonder why we haven’t been doing this the whole time.

He says that if you order fries from McDonald’s and ask for them without salt on, they will be cooked fresh as all the fries that are ready to go will have salt on them already.

This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

So, asking for fries without salt is a foolproof way of getting the freshest, hottest chips possible.

To prove his point, Johnny ordered two lots of fries – a normal portion and a portion without salt. He tested the temperature of both portions, and the saltless ones were much hotter.

Obviously, if you’re into salty chips, you’ll then have to add your own when you get home. Or, if you’re eating on the go, you may need to carry salt sachets around in your handbag.

But seeing as this is a judgment-free zone, you do you.

The company has gotten its share of celebrity endorsements, too: Warren Buffett says he's a ""Coke loyalist,"" and Berkshire Hathaway is a longstanding investor.

While the company's stock price has been largely steady over the past decade, though, any individual stock can over- or underperform, and past returns do not predict future results.

CNBC: Coca-Cola stock as of Feb. 15, 2019

Shares fell Thursday and were on track for their worst day since the Great Recession. The company's stock price fell 7.5 percent and its net sales fell 6 percent. (Net sales still topped expectations.)

Chief executive officer James Quincey told analysts that currency fluctuations, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and changing tax rates could be responsible for the stock's slide. ""Clearly, that is leading to an [earnings per share] growth that is not what we aspire to,"" he said.

He expressed similar concerns at the 49th World Economic Forum in Davos: ""I think we are in the phase of 2019 where we are likely to see a little less growth. It is going to be a slightly tougher year in macroeconomic terms and we need to work our way through it.""

Some analysts see problems facing the traditional soda market overall. Ivan Feinseth, of financial firm Tigress Financial Partners, said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" that ""there is no growth in carbonated soda,"" and that brands like Coke and longtime rival Pepsi need to get creative.

They'll need to ""continue to develop or acquire other alternatives,"" Feinseth explains, like sparking water, flavored seltzers, teas and sports drinks, since ""that's where the growth is, in the niche beverage markets.""

Coca-Cola does offer products besides sodas, and it continues to diversify its portfolio. The company made six new acquisitions in 2018, among them coffee chain Costa Coffee. They also own popular beverage brands Dasani, Minute Maid and Powerade.

It shouldn’t be used for general insomnia. ,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/melatonin-dosage-and-risks_n_56deff8ce4b03a40567a1e1e,"Melatonin is a very popular sleep aid. It’s naturally produced in your body. You don’t need a prescription for it and can buy it in gummy form or in a fruity drink. But is it as effective and safe as we think?

Natural melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, helps humans fall asleep ― and synthetic melatonin has been available as a sleep aid for nearly three decades. But the synthetic version’s effects have not been extensively studied, and since it’s classified as a “dietary supplement,” it is almost completely unregulated by the FDA.

It’s important to take a closer look at this common supplement. “Any person in the sleep world will tell you the same thing: melatonin is not harmless, is vastly overused and should not be used as a sleep aid to treat insomnia,” Michael Grandner, a sleep researcher at the University of Arizona, told HuffPost.

How it works

Melatonin is meant to reset the body’s internal clock ― for example, it’s appropriate to use the supplement to counter the effects of jet lag, or help someone sleep if they have an unusual work schedule or suffer from a circadian rhythm disorder. It should not be used for general insomnia.

The proper dosage, according to a seminal 2001 study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is 0.3 milligrams. The research was conducted by Richard Wurtman, who pioneered the pharmaceutical use of melatonin as a sleep aid in 1994. Pills and supplements often sell 10 times that suggested amount in a single dose. This can lead to higher plasma melatonin levels the next day, which can cause a “hangover” effect that leaves users groggy.

According to a 2005 meta-analysis of melatonin studies from MIT, also led by Wurtman, researchers found that the widely available high doses of melatonin are ineffective. “After a few days, it stops working,” wrote Wurtman, in a press release accompanying the study. When the brain’s melatonin receptors are exposed to too much of the hormone, they become unresponsive, he said.

Safety concerns

Melatonin may also be unsafe for children. David Kennaway, the director of the circadian physiology lab at the University of Adelaide in Australia, told Science Daily that the use of melatonin to treat children’s sleep disorders is “rather alarming.”

He said there is “extensive evidence from laboratory studies that melatonin causes changes in multiple physiological systems, including cardiovascular, immune and metabolic systems, as well as reproduction in animals,” and its effects on children’s developing bodies is yet unstudied.

“The word ‘safe’ is used very freely and loosely with this drug,” said Kennaway, “but there have been no rigorous, long-term safety studies of the use of melatonin to treat sleep disorders in children and adolescents.”

Even for adults, the unregulated nature of the supplement gives cause for reconsideration. Although synthetic melatonin is “chemically identical” to natural melatonin, commercially available supplements “often contain fillers, inert and other ingredients that may cause effects that would not be expected with natural melatonin,” Clete Kushida, a sleep researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, told HuffPost in an email.

“This is a concern that clinicians should relay to patients, especially since the contents of the supplements are not regulated by the FDA,” said Kushida. “And since it’s not regulated by the FDA, the long-term effects/consequences have not been studied in a controlled and systematic manner.”

“The word 'safe' is used very freely and loosely with this drug.” - David Kennaway, University of Adelaide

The verdict

So why do people still use it?

“Unfortunately, it’s acquired a reputation as a safe, ‘natural,’ over-the-counter quick-fix for sleep that will be hard to shake,” said Grandner.

That conviction may explain why melatonin is so popular even though it’s apparently not that effective.

Consumer Reports said melatonin supplements helped users fall asleep “only 7 minutes faster and sleep 8 minutes longer on average,” according to a 2013 analysis. And the same report notes that “about 20 percent of users in our survey reported next-day grogginess,” and recommended that users exercise caution before driving the next day.

“Melatonin is not an insomnia cure,” Grandner emphasized. “The main reasons regular people find it hard to sleep ― tossing and turning, ruminating in bed ― will not be affected by melatonin.” He suggested that the vast majority of people who struggle to fall asleep would be better served by establishing a consistent routine, practicing good sleep hygiene in the bedroom and getting lots of daytime light exposure.",Read This If You Take Melatonin To Sleep At Night

Both the Venti and Grande have 150 milligrams of caffeine. ,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ex-starbucks-barista-explains-why-155900768.html,"From Delish

A recently resurfaced 2017 Business Insider article reveals the best way to hack the Starbucks system. In it, a former barista explains that if you're at Starbucks because you want as much coffee as humanly possible (which, yeah), the only way to do it is to order a Venti Iced drink.

The pro explained that while you might think a Venti Hot drink would have three shots of espresso because a Tall has one and a Grande has two, that's not the case. It turns out a Venti latte, mocha, etc. comes with the same two shots of espresso as a Grande does.

Want further proof? Starbucks nutrition facts confirm that both a Grande caffe latte, for example, and a Venti one come in at 150 milligrams of caffeine.

There are ways to circumvent this tragic and sneaky problem. ""A Venti iced drink [which is 24 ounces] gets three shots,"" the expert noted: ""So next time, if you're most concerned about a necessary java buzz, either order your Venti iced or ask for an extra shot.""

No. ,https://www.valuewalk.com/2019/02/ios-12-1-4-battery-life-test-iphones/,"Apple released iOS 12.1.4 last week, primarily to fix the Group FaceTime bug. We have often seen interim updates increase iPhones’ battery life due to optimizations and other tweaks. However, the opposite can also happen, so the YouTube channel iAppleBytes carried out the iOS 12.1.4 battery life test to find out whether the latest iOS update has affected battery life.

iOS 12.1.4 battery life test shows marginal or no improvement

iAppleBytes conducted the popular Geekbench battery life benchmark test on an iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 running on the latest version of iOS. The channel regularly performs this test on the latest version, and whenever the next one is released, it runs the tests again and releases an update.

After performing the iOS 12.1.4 battery life test, iAppleBytes compared the results with those from the iOS 12.1.3 test. Overall, the iOS 12.1.4 battery life test showed a very marginal improvement over the previous version of iOS. The biggest gainer was the iPhone 8, which gained six minutes after updating to iOS 12.1.4. However, that’s not a big gain when you consider how long it takes the entire battery to drain.

You can see the comparison video in its entirety here:

It makes sense that there would be no improvement or a very marginal one, considering the lack of feature-related changes between the two iOS releases. Speed test videos for iOS 12.1.4 yielded similar results as well, indicating no major changes in the speeds between the two versions.

The speed and battery life tests essentially verify that the iOS 12.1.4 update contains only bug fixes. Apple is expected to release iOS 12.2 later this month or in early March, so hopefully we will see some battery improvements then.

Fixes a few bugs, but triggers more for some

Apple’s iOS 12.1.4 update addresses the Group FaceTime bug, which captured many headlines last week. The issue with FaceTime allowed users to eavesdrop on others even when their call was not answered. In other words, the caller could hear everything on the other line just by calling, even if the receiver had not accepted the call.

Apple was widely criticized for the bug. To ensure that the issue causes no further problems, Apple disabled the feature for everyone at the time. Now the latest update re-enables the feature for all.

“A logic issue existed in the handling of Group FaceTime calls. The issue was addressed with improved state management,” Apple said on its support page.

The latest update also fixed an unidentified vulnerability in FaceTime’s Live Photos feature. Additionally, according to Google’s Project Zero security team, iOS 12.1.4 fixed two zero-day vulnerabilities code-named CVE-2019-7286 and CVE-2019-7287. These vulnerabilities were related to a memory corruption issue.

In addition to those bug fixes, iOS 12.1.4 appears have triggered new issues as well. Some users took to Twitter to complain about a new network connectivity issue. One user said his phone is not accepting any SIM, while another faced issues “connecting to my home Wifi [sic] Network..”

There are other complaints about other issues as well, like degraded performance in the AirPods, voice memos, cellular, Touch ID and more. However, Forbes pointed out that users have been facing similar issues since the iOS 12.1.2 update.

The iOS 12.2 update is expected to be Apple’s first big software change for 2019. The developer beta hints at more Animoji and few front-facing user interface tweaks as well. Specifically, Apple is expected to add four new Animoji: Shark, Giraffe, Owl and Warthog.

Other changes include a slightly-tweaked Control Center. For example, the Screen Mirroring button will no longer be represented by a triangle with a floating rectangular box on top of it. Instead, it will show two rectangles overlapping each other.

Another useful change is related to the Apple TV shortcut button. The button displays a virtual remote which is almost the length of the screen. This addition is helpful if you own an Apple TV box or an AirPlay-2-compatible 4K TV or you don’t have a remote.

There is an update for Apple Maps as well. With iOS 12.2, you will be able to see the air quality index (AQI) for the area you view on Apple Maps. The AQI data was added to the Weather app in iOS 12.0, and now, Apple is integrating it into Maps as well.",Does The iOS 12.1.4 Update Boost The Battery Life Of iPhones?

The new drink will hit shelves later this month. It's a way to encourage customers who are seeking more variety to stick with Coke rather than pick up a different soda, said Kate Carpenter, brand director for Coca-Cola Trademark, which includes Coke, Coke Zero and flavored Cokes.

The beverage company decided to add to and revamp its flavor offerings — Cherry Coke, Cherry Coke Zero, Vanilla Coke and Vanilla Coke Zero — after the successful launch of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar last year, Carpenter said. The new flavor will also come in a Zero Sugar version.

4.5 billion years from now. ,https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/space/2019/02/our-galaxy-due-crash-its-neighbor-when,"As astronomers report in the Astrophysical Journal, the originally predicted crash date of 3.9 billion years from now has been pushed back by about 600 million years. And instead of a head-on collision, astronomers are predicting more of an initial glancing blow—kind of like knocking into a neighbor’s rear-view mirror.

“The overall picture is not too different,” says study author Roeland van der Marel of the Space Telescope Science Institute. “But the exact orbital pathways are different.”

Is that good news? It sounds like this collision is still inevitable.

It is inevitable. Andromeda, which is currently 2.5 million light-years away, is hurtling toward the Milky Way at nearly 250,000 miles an hour.

Astronomers have known this since Vesto Slipher first aimed a telescope at Andromeda and measured the galaxy’s motion in 1912. (He didn’t know it was a galaxy at the time, when conventional wisdom suggested it was a nebulous cloud inside the Milky Way. Needless to say, Slipher’s calculations suggested that idea needed revising).

Later, astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope were able to measure the sideways motion of Andromeda, which determines whether the galaxies are destined for a direct hit or a cosmic brush-pass. Using those observations, in 2012 van der Marel and his team forecast a head-on collision in roughly 3.9 billion years—a prediction they’ve just revised.

“It is interesting, even though it is in some ways a fairly minor modification of what was known previously,” says Brant Robertson of the University of California, Santa Cruz.

What did Gaia do differently from Hubble?

Gaia took a good look at 1,084 of the brightest stars within Andromeda and measured their motions. Then, van der Marel and his team averaged those observations and calculated Andromeda’s rotation rate for the first time, as well as making new calculations of the galaxy’s side-to-side movement.",Our galaxy is due to crash into its neighbor—but when?
"Narcissistic, insecure, or selfish people. ",https://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-3-types-of-people-most-likely-to-cheat-according-to-love-life-strategist-matthew-hussey/,"Do you — or your partner — fit into one of these categories?Shutterstock/conrado

Infidelity is one of the biggest causes of breakups — and of divorce.

For New York Times best selling author and ""love life strategist"" Matthew Hussey, cheating is ""whatever the two of you have decided is beyond the boundary of what is OK.""

""There can be no one definition of cheating,"" he told Business Insider. ""It's whatever it is to each partner. In an open relationship, this could be that one of you slept with someone and didn’t tell [the other].""

The bad news is that cheating appears to be more common than you may have realised.

A 2015 YouGov survey for The Sun found that one in five British adults had had an affair, while a third said they had thought about it. A quarter admitted to having had two affairs, while 20% had had three or more, and 8% had had five or more affairs.

According to Hussey, though, there are three types of people that are more likely to cheat than others.

1. Narcissists.

""For the narcissist it's all about proving how lovable they are,"" said Hussey. ""It's not enough one person loving them; they want to make sure that everyone loves them.""

""They'll only feel validated when someone else flirts with them, sleeps with them, or kisses them,"" he added.

A study found that narcissism is linked to people feeling less committed overall in ongoing romantic relationships, in part because they like the idea of finding someone better.

2. Insecure people.

""Insecure people are something to be careful of. And I don't mean a basic level of insecurity that we all have, because we all have our own self-doubts and worries about ourselves. But when someone is so deeply insecure that if you don't give them love today, they're going to find it somewhere else — that's dangerous.""

""In any relationship we have to be real,"" Hussey added. ""If someone goes without love for a long time, the propensity to cheat is going to increase. Over a long enough period of time if someone treats you coldly or is distant, anything can happen. But on a short timeline, if somebody is constantly making how much you love them today the condition on whether they'll cheat or not, [this is] also dangerous and it stems from ego.""

3. People who are just plain selfish.

Hussey said ""selfish people who don't have a moral standard when it comes to their relationships"" are the third type most likely to cheat. ""They know if they cheat their partner would hate it or be traumatised by it, but their own selfish needs just take over,"" he said.

""Either they have a different code of ethics in private for themselves — which is just unfair — or they're simply a hypocrite.""

A dead sperm whale. ,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/a-gigantic-blob-carcass-keeps-washing-up-on-hawaiis-coast/,"No matter how hard they tried, authorities in Hawaii just couldn't get rid of a giant floating marshmallowy creature that kept washing up on their coastline. Fortunately, since the blob was being so stubborn, it provided scientists with some solid insights into marine life and the local environment.

The gigantic blob is, in fact, the carcass of a 15-meter-long (50-foot) sperm whale that first washed ashore on January 10 along the south coast of O’ahu, close to the Sand Island State Recreation Area near Honolulu. The remains were hauled out 24 kilometers (15 miles) into the open ocean by a jet ski, but quickly washed up again.

A week on, it was then dragged out to around 3.8 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the shore. That was hoped to be the end of the story, until it reappeared on a remote beach along the west coast.

“The agencies involved (DLNR, NOAA), have made the decision to leave the carcass in place, to let nature take its course and to let us learn from this carcass,” David Schofield, Marine Mammal Response Coordinator for the NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, said in a news release.

“We continue to ask people not to disturb this carcass, as both state and federal laws could come into play,"" he added. ""Additionally, due to the possible presence of bones and tissues in the nearshore waters, there could be continued shark activity.""

Since this sperm whale stuck around for so long, marine biologists from the University of Hawaii at Mānoa decided to seize the opportunity to study it. Researchers have flocked to the carcass to collect teeth and bones as the body decomposes. A necropsy last week showed that the sperm whale was most likely suffering from disease, although thankfully they discovered no signs of debris in its gut.",A Gigantic Blob Carcass Keeps Washing Up On Hawaii's Coast

Aside from the actual game, though, one of the most important aspects of the production is the half time show. It’s when one of the biggest artists of the year plays a mini-concert which is broadcast to literally millions of people around the world.

These half time shows have long been a subject of controversy. Sometimes they’re criticised as “too sexy” for a slot intended for family viewing, other times the choice of artist can seem a little suspect. This year the honour went to pop-rock giants, Maroon 5. The band played alongside rap artist (and boyfriend and baby daddy to a certain Jenner) Travis Scott.

Often the half time show divides viewers – but this year, it seems audiences around the world were all saying the same thing about the show.

Here’s Bruno Mars playing in 2014. So you get the idea – the Super Bowl half time show is a super big deal. It’s not just a regular live TV appearance or concert. It’s a cultural event.

The half time show is no stranger to controversy. via Getty Images In 2004, Janet Jackson sang alongside a young Justin Timberlake. Timberlake ended up exposing Jackson’s breast on stage, which caused an absolute uproar with the viewing public.

Even more controversial? Timberlake was invited back to perform for the 2017 half time show, while Jackson’s career never fully recovered from the incident.

Whatever happens, the half time show is always big news. But what happened this year sort of blew prior years right out of the water – but not for any reasons you may expect.

Now let’s get into the background to this year’s controversy. via Shutterstock It all stems back to this man, Colin Kaepernick, and his political activism.



advertisement

Kaepernick rose to fame as an NFL quarterback. But he last played football in 2016. He’s now better known for his political activism, which has an odd connection to the NFL.

Kaepernick’s activism revolved around the Black Lives Matter movement. via Shutterstock The movement was a criticism of (and protest against) the way police officers, in particularly, treated black people. It was inspired by a selection of police shootings of unarmed black victims.

In solidarity with the black community, Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem. via Shutterstock He inspired a lot of controversy for his decision, but stood by it, and was forced to leave the NFL because of it. Kaepernick has become an inspirational figure in the Black Lives Matter movement.

The decision to ban Kaepernick hasn’t been without outcry. In fact, it made finding an act to perform at this year’s Super Bowl half time show a struggle. Rihanna was reportedly one of the artists to refuse, out of solidarity with Kaepernick.



advertisement

A band that didn’t refuse? via Shutterstock Maroon 5. The pop-rock five-piece accepted the offer to perform this year, in spite of the political implications of their decision.



advertisement

The band were joined on stage by rapper Travis Scott. Scott is a popular name in the current rap scene, and is also the boyfriend of Kylie Jenner. The two have a baby together, named Stormi, who was born on February 1st, 2018.



advertisement

So it’s safe to say audiences were already somewhat on the back foot. It’s kind of hard to justify performing at an NFL show without questioning their policies surrounding Kaepernick.



advertisement

But we guess, if you put on a good enough show, all is forgiven. Unfortunately, it appears that didn’t happen, either. Judging by the internet’s reaction to Maroon 5 and Scott’s performance, it seems they’ve doubled down on their potentially poor move.



advertisement

Let’s just say, the reception wasn’t fantastic. In fact, overall, the 2019 Super Bowl has been criticised as a bit of a let down – but it’s clear the Maroon 5 performance didn’t help matters.



advertisement

For many, Maroon 5 just don’t have the back catalogue of music. Especially the sort that would be required for such an enormous performance. In fact, their first few songs, from their 2002 debut album Songs About Jane were giving some viewers unwanted middle school flashbacks.



advertisement

The risk of going for a less prolific band may not have paid off. When compared to the canon of other Super Bowl half time performers, Maroon 5 certainly had some daunting shoes to fill, after all.



advertisement

Even celebrities got in on the action. Basketball superstar LeBron James seemed overall just baffled by the shoddy, rough-around-the-edges performance.



advertisement

The performance wasn’t the only thing people weren’t too keen on, though. One particular area of criticism was lead singer Adam Levine’s choice of shirt. Many viewers thought the brown spotted pattern looked a little too familiar.



advertisement

Another hilarious Tweet compared the performance to another well known disaster. The picture, taken from 2017’s ill-fated Fyre Festival, shows a reality that is significantly lower than expectations.



advertisement

It seems nothing could save this show. Not even a Spongbob Squarepants cameo could get viewers back on side. That’s how you know things have gone badly wrong.



advertisement

Aside from the iffy half time show, though, viewers had even more issues. The game itself has been criticised as extremely dull, plus the winners were a team that a large amount of the USA can hardly stand.



advertisement

The show wasn’t without its defenders. via Getty Images Some believed that it was preconceptions about the performance which were the reasons for its poor reception. Many thought it was the bad taste the lack of political activism left in people’s mouths that people found unpleasant, rather than Maroon 5’s performance itself.



advertisement

Either way, it’s pretty unlikely that history will remember the show favourably. It’s likely that their choice to perform may not have been the wisest career move for the band. And as for that choice of sweater vest? Perhaps even worse.

",Everyone Said the Same Thing About Maroon 5’s Halftime Show
Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald at $22.5 million. ,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/the-highest-paid-player-in-super-bowl-is-not-tom-brady.html,"New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is a five-time Super Bowl winner, has been named AP NFL Most Valuable Player three times and is, statistically, one of the best players in the National Football League.

But he's still not the highest-paid player in this year's big game.

CNBC Make It used numbers from sports data website Spotrac to find the 2018-2019 average salary for each player on the Patriots and Los Angeles Rams. The highest-paid player: Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald, whose average annual salary is a whopping $22.5 million.

By comparison, the second highest-paid player is Rams wide receiver Brandin Cooks, who'll be paid $16.2 million this season. Brady ranks No. 3, with $15 million.

The total amount a player takes in depends on several factors like signing bonuses, performance incentives and endorsement deals, of which, Brady has many. He earned $14 million in endorsements in 2018 and may earn another $5 million in bonuses ""after the Patriots added incentives to his contract ahead of the season start,"" Forbes reports.

For now, at least, Donald, the 2017 and 2018 AP Defensive Player of the Year, has the edge. At the beginning of this season, he signed a $135 million deal to be paid out over the next six years, and that, in combination with his endorsement deals and signing bonus, put him at No. 5 on Forbes' list of highest-paid players. (Brady comes in at No. 8.)

Donald wasn't always an athletic powerhouse, though. In fact, he was ""lazy as a kid,"" he said in an interview with ESPN. That was before his father, Archie, introduced him to weightlifting in a homemade basement gym at age 12.

With little time to react, he quickly put himself in danger to save the life of a neighbor’s dog.

The Shih Tzu named Mel was teetering on the edge of his balcony. Something inside Augusto told him that the little dog was going to fall. He was right. Mel lost his footing and started his deadly fall from the 9th floor.





The fall would definentely kill him, so Augusto stepped in and positioned himself to catch the little dog before he hit the ground. However, the impact would be forceful and could danger the good samaritan. Just like a typical hero, Augusto did not think about himself, he was only concerned with saving the dog.





Augusto positioned himself perfectly and was able to catch the little dog, just in time. However, the force sent him to the ground and the dog fell through his arms. However, Mel quickly got to his feet and ran off without a scratch.

“I was on the floor for a few seconds but it was from relief. I think that I was in the right place at the right time. I did what I could, the most I could to help. It was a joint effort with the caretaker who acted quickly to help the dog. It was a happy ending,” Augusto tells DailyMail.

Mel’s owner was not home at the time of the incident, but has since installed a mesh protector on the balcony to prevent him from climbing it.

After his heroic act, Augusto’s rescue has gone viral. He is a hero and being praised around the world for his bravery.

Rapid snowfall was captured on video in Michigan, where a winter storm warning is in effect as dangerous Arctic temperatures hit the Midwest.

The timelapse, posted online Monday by ""The Mitten Dad,"" showed 15 inches of snow dropping outside of a home in just 13 seconds.

POLAR VORTEX LINKED TO 6 DEATHS AS DANGEROUS COLD SLAMS THE MIDWEST

A polar vortex — the cold air and low pressure that constantly surrounds both of the Earth’s poles — has allowed bitter cold temperatures to drop much farther south than normal, and has slammed the Midwestern area of the U.S.

In Kalamazoo, where the video was filmed, temperatures hit minus 13 degrees Wednesday, with wind chill temperatures recorded at minus 37 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.

For comparison, temperatures in Antarctica, where the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station is located, hit minus 25 degrees.

Become a plumber. ,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/dirty-jobs-mike-rowes-career-advice-follow-opportunity-not-passion.html,"The idea of following your passion may sound romantic, but it usually doesn't work out the way you think it will, according to ""Dirty Jobs"" host Mike Rowe.

Too many people spend too much time and money chasing their passion when seizing opportunity is a better bet, he says.

""If there was a recurring lesson on 'Dirty Jobs,' it was to understand how many people we featured on that show that looked like they were doing something that should have made them miserable, but were in fact very, very happy in their work. And surprisingly prosperous,"" says Rowe, whose new Discovery Channel limited series, ""Dirty Jobs: Rowe'd Trip,"" premieres Tuesday.

Many people plan their life around finding job satisfaction and often, ""that plan includes borrowing vast sums of money in order to go to a four-year school to get the degree that will allow you to get to the next step as you seek to get the thing that will make you happy,"" he says. (The average student loan debt per borrower is $32,731, according to the U.S. Department of Education.)

""And now they have to go out into the world to try and get hired into their chosen field,"" he says. ""And it doesn't always work out. In fact, it rarely works out.""

""That's part of why we have [over $1.6 trillion dollars in student loans] on the books. I think a lot of people were told that if they borrowed the money to get their degree, then they would wind up with the job that they were passionate about.""

However, ""if you think there's only one job in the country that can possibly satisfy your passion, then you're gonna spend a lot of time looking for that one job as opposed to finding an opportunity.""

And finding opportunity in the job market is key, according to Rowe. He says many people he featured on ""Dirty Jobs"" were actually multimillionaires who achieved success by fulfilling a gap in the market rather doing what they were personally interested in.

""The truth is, [for] most passionate people on ['Dirty Jobs'] anyway, [they] weren't passionate about what they were doing when they started doing it,"" Rowe says.

""They simply...learned a skill that was in demand. Then they got hired applying that skill. Then they figured out how to get really, really good at it. And then they figured out how to love it.""

Rowe isn't the only entrepreneur who rejects the idea of following your passion to determine your career.

""One of the great lies of life is 'follow your passions,'"" because what you're passionate about may not be realistic, billionaire Mark Cuban said in 2018.

""I used to be passionate about being a professional basketball player. Then I realized I had a 7-inch vertical,"" says Cuban. (Top contenders in the 2019 NBA draft all had a max vertical leap over 40 inches.)

Instead, ""evaluate and say, 'Okay, where am I putting in my time?'"" Cuban said. Because ""where you put in your effort, that tends to be the things that you are good at. And if you put in enough time, you tend to get really good at it,"" Cuban said.

It's how Cuban became a tech mogul. When he was young, he was never interested in technology: ""I took one computer class and cheated at it,"" he said in an interview on ABC's ""Shark Tank.""

""But when I got one of my first jobs out of school using technology, it was like, wait, I love this. I've taught myself the program, I could go seven hours, eight hours without taking a break thinking it was 10 minutes because I was concentrating so hard and so excited and really loved it. And that's when I realized that I can be really, really good at technology.""

Such expertise was also in demand. So Cuban started his first business, MicroSolutions, which he sold to CompuServe for $6 million in 1990.

Today, Cuban is worth $4.3 billion.

So Rowe urges young people to ""keep your mind open"" when it comes to finding a career.

""We all want to be engaged. We all want to love whatever it is we do,"" Rowe admits. ""But I don't know that the best way to do that for a 17-year-old person is to try and identify what they think will make them happy and then borrow whatever it takes to go get it.""

Try ""doing what you can to be great"" at a skill that is in demand. ""And then [do] what you can to love it. In the end, you still want to wind up passionate about whatever you're doing. Just a question of the chronology you choose to get there.""

“Mama.” Video in comments. ,https://www.apost.com/en/blog/mom-breaks-down-in-mcdonalds-drive-thru-as-5-year-old-autistic-daughter-says-her-first-ever-word/16537/,"Mom Breaks Down In McDonalds Drive-Thru As 5-Year-Old Autistic Daughter Says Her First Ever Word

In 2018, Alabama resident Briana Blankenship posted a video on Facebook of her 5-year-old autistic daughter saying her first word ever. In the short but altogether heartfelt video, Briana asks her daughter Taylor to say ""mama"" while at the drive-through, and for the first time, she speaks.

This was such a momentous occasion as little Taylor falls on the autism spectrum and is non-verbal. Before this moment in that random drive-through, Briana had never heard her daughter's voice before, as she had never uttered a single word. Then, without any prompting, Taylor made herself heard from the backseat. Briana was understandably overtaken with emotion, as can be seen in the videos below.

Knowing that this was a very special occasion, Briana grabbed her cell phone and started recording. She knew that her husband, Taylor's father, would want to see and hear this wonderful moment. But first, she had to hope Taylor would repeat her utterance. And luckily, she did. Prompted by Briana, Taylor repeated her first and so far only word: ""Mama.""

In the video, it is clear to see that Briana can barely keep it together when she hears her daughter's voice. Every time she successfully prompts Taylor to speak again, Briana can be heard squealing with joy and excitement. Her happiness is so infectious that Taylor also starts to smile brightly, simply enjoying that she can make her mother so happy.

Briana uploaded the video to Facebook, where she tagged her family. Soon, not only her family but many others had seen the footage that was widely shared across the platform.

When she filmed the now popular clip, Briana's daughter Taylor was five years old. She has non-verbal autism, which means that she does not speak since her brain processes information differently, according to Tech Times.

This factor of Taylor's autism originally made Briana wonder if she would ever hear a word from her daughter. Fortunately, in this case, that time did come. It came in an unlikely place, as Briana and Taylor were in the car sitting in the drive-through at McDonald's.

apost.com

As Briana explained in an interview with WHNT News 19, her daughter's first word came completely unprompted: ""I heard her say it. I whipped around and I'm just like 'did you just say mama?!'""

Taylor had indeed said, ""mama."" Briana's shock was massive and, at first, left her in tears. Once she broke down crying, she couldn't stop for a bit. As she explained in her description of the original Facebook video, she must have made a curious sight to the McDonald's employees and other drivers:

""I am ugly crying in the McDonald's parking lot and the employees probably think I'm crazy. [...] I'm pretty sure I held up the drive thru line but there was no way I wasn't getting proof of this. I can't explain how unbelievably grateful and ecstatic I am right now.""

Her daughter, who had never said a single word and who, according to doctors, might have never talked at all, had called her ""mama."" That moment is undoubtedly etched into Briana's mind forever.

With Taylor's sudden verbal burst, Briana hastened to capture the moment. She grabbed the phone through her tears and just started recording. She wanted proof of what just happened, no matter how long it took.

That first word opens up the hope that maybe, one day, Taylor will gain the ability to talk in complete sentences. She has a long journey ahead of her, but this was the step that made the future a lot brighter.

Non-verbal autism is a special subset of autism that is sadly considered underrepresented in medical research. As a result of this lack, not much is known about the causes, possible treatments, and further ramifications of non-verbal autism. Some studies estimate that between 25% to 50% of all children who are diagnosed with non-verbal autism never learn to speak properly at all. Instead, these children develop the skills to use a few words or utterances, never gaining more mastery of the spoken language.

It is important to note that their lack of verbal language does not mean these children are less intelligent than normal ones. They simply lack one tool of communication other children can make use of.

From Men's Health

Last night at the SAG Awards, Michael B. Jordan joined the small but influential list of men who have rocked a harness on the red carpet for an awards show in 2019. And the actor-who came up big at the festivities when Black Panther won for best cast performance in a movie-wasn't shy about his particular choice of harness. It was bold and bright, covered in watercolor splashes of pink, purple, and yellow, and emblazoned with the iconic Louis Vuitton monogram.

This isn't the first time the harness has made an appearance at a major event this year; Timothée Chalamet wore one in sparkly black at the Golden Globes. And last year, Olympian Adam Rippon wore a leather one under his tux at the Oscars. So, despite the tinge of S&M and the maybe-leather-daddy vibe the accessory carries with it, it's becoming kind of A Thing for black-tie affairs.

So what's going on here? Well, for one thing, we're expanding our fashion vocabulary. As Esquire's own Justin Kirkland wrote earlier this month, ""Queer fashion flexes are your next step, so whip out that harness (with or without the dress shirt) and get your pair of cloven boots because I hope the future is full of leather and glitter.""

SHOP LOUIS VUITTON SPRING/SUMMER 2019

But we also can't understate the influence of one designer here: Virgil Abloh. He took the reins of Louis Vuitton's menswear last year, and harnesses featured heavily in his debut spring/summer 2019 collection. No coincidence, then, that both Michael B. Jordan and Timothée Chalamet opted to wear harnesses-or, in the fashion house's parlance, ""mid-layers""-on the red carpet.

Is the harness the next big thing for normal guys? Will your old college buddy opt for one at his wedding? Can you expect your nephew to rock one on prom night? Well, if your college buddy knows the word ""couture"" and your nephew is really into the streetwear-meets-high-fashion scene that catapulted Abloh into the menswear stratosphere... maybe. Or maybe not. But let's remember that Michael B. Jordan did just win a prestigious award while wearing one. Maybe it's all connected.

('You Might Also Like',)",Why Are Celebrities Like Michael B. Jordan Wearing Harnesses on the Red Carpet?
No. ,https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a3111/can-all-season-tires-really-handle-the-snow/,"Back in 1977, Goodyear introduced the Tiempo, the first tire dubbed all-season. The idea was simple and alluring: Instead of dealing with the hassle of switching between snow and summer tires as the seasons change, drivers could use one tire all the time. Sales skyrocketed and other companies quickly followed suit. These days nearly all vehicles sold in the United States are fitted with all-season tires from the factory, and 97.5 percent of replacement-tire sales are the same. But is that such a good idea? Actually, no. It turns out that all-season tires are fine in warmer months, but in the snow, they lack traction compared with dedicated snow tires. And that means that the millions of drivers who make do with all-season tires in the winter months are driving cars that aren't as safe as those shod with tires designed for icy conditions.

We know because we traveled to northern Minnesota, home of some of the nation's harshest conditions, to test the claim of the all-season tire. And since all-wheel drive is rapidly becoming a common option, we also tested the notion that the feature is a suitable substitute for snow tires. Our assumption was that, while AWD improves some aspects of winter performance, it doesn't help a car turn or stop, and the added weight of the mechanical bits can actually be a disadvantage. Common sense and physics suggested this to be true, but nothing proves a point like data. And the best way to gather data on winter-tire performance is to find yourself an icy, snowy proving ground.

Ice Driving

There's something foreboding about traveling to a place so cold it's called the Ice Box, but Baudette, Minn., was the perfect place to run our experiments. The sprawling Automotive Enviro Testing facility there specializes in frigid-weather testing for many large auto manufacturers. With a five-month winter season, the facility can maintain enormous snow and ice surfaces kept within strict tolerances by GPS-controlled tractors towing custom-built ice- and snow-grooming systems—basically the world's largest Zambonis.

To set a level playing field, we brought along two nearly identical four-cylinder Chevy Equinoxes—one optioned with front-wheel drive, the other with AWD. We ran both through a series of tests to measure acceleration, braking, hill-climb and turning ability. The cars were first outfitted with Goodyear all-season tires, then we ran the tests again with Goodyear snow tires. We ran each test numerous times and then averaged the results. To minimize the variables, the same driver performed all the tests, and the traction- and stability-control systems were left on. Data collection was completed with the industry standard VBOX—a GPS and accelerometer-based data logger.

The Bottom Line

In a contest between all-season and winter tires driven on snow and ice, the latter won the day. Although the year-round rubber performed admirably, it's clear in all situations that with either FWD or AWD there's a substantial advantage to having proper rubber under you. The results were especially striking during braking and cornering, when snow tires improved performance by up to 5 percent and 20 percent, respectively.

The New Wild Card: Winter-Biased All-Seasons

Tire Rack

This is a relatively recent offshoot of all-season tire, denoted by the ""3 Peak Mountain Snowflake"" (3PMSF) symbol on the sidewall. Goodyear calls this type of tire All Weather, but that's their trademark—Tire Rack refers to these tires as ""Premium Traction."" Whatever you call them, they're designed to cheat the all-season formula in the direction of winter performance. The 3PMSF ""indicates they deliver at least a minimum level of acceleration traction on medium packed snow,"" says Woody Rogers, director of tire information for Tire Rack. ""We find they work surprisingly well in the snow, but of course cannot equal a true winter tire. Which one is 'best' really depends on what else besides snow traction you place emphasis on.""

We haven't tested this type of all-season, but Tire Rack tested three of the latest tires in this group against a non-3PMSF tire—the Pirelli Cinturato P7 All Season Plus—in northern Sweden to assess traction on snow and ice (a hockey rink was involved). Some of the tires use interesting tricks to extend their winter usefulness—the Goodyear Assurance WeatherReady uses soybean oil in the tread compound to help keep it pliable in the cold—and of them fared surprisingly well for all-season tires. The consensus was that in coming years all-seasons are going to edge closer to winter tires in terms of cold-weather performance. The test concluded that, ""These first movers have set the bar very high, and while they won't replace a set of dedicated winter tires for drivers in the snow belt, they are a viable option for anyone who typically uses all-season tires year-round and is looking for improved traction in inclement weather.""

A Few More Tips

Buying and living with winter tires isn't that much of an inconvenience, but there are some guidelines you should follow:

If you live anywhere north of the Mason-Dixon line, it's probably worthwhile to invest in winter tires.

Make sure you buy four tires; skimping and putting winter tires only on the drive end of the car will result in unpredictable handling and could be dangerous.

If you're looking for a bargain, sometimes there are batches of leftover tires for sale. As with cars, not every tire gets sold the same year it's manufactured—and sometimes not for several years afterward. While these leftover tires might not have the exact level of outright grip as a fresh tire, they carry the same warranty and are perfectly fine for anyone who's not scrutinizing the last hundredth of a G in lateral acceleration. And they can be a great deal.

If you'd rather not remount your tires each season, pick up a separate set of inexpensive steel wheels for permanent winter-tire duty. (This also keeps expensive alloy wheels from getting damaged in harsh, salty winter conditions.)

Swap to winter tires around Thanksgiving and back to all-season or summer tires around Easter—winter tires' softer rubber compounds wear quickly in warmer temperatures.

Store off-season tires in a cool, dry area out of the sun, and consider wrapping them in black plastic bags to reduce oxidation.

Keep in mind that having two sets of tires isn't doubling the expense, it's halving the wear. You'll have twice the number of tires but buy new ones half as often.

Remember, fancy new tires or not, the standard winter driving advice still applies: Slow down, double your following distances, anticipate traffic changes ahead, and give yourself extra time to get where you're going. Good luck out there!

The Stop Stupidity Act ,https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-government-shutdowns,"The new fiscal year (FY) will begin on October 1, 2021, and Congress has so far enacted none of the 12 appropriations bills setting discretionary spending levels. Lawmakers have until midnight on the final day of the fiscal year – September 30 – to enact legislation to fund the programs covered by the appropriations process, or the government will shut down. A continuing resolution (CR) to allow lawmakers more time to complete work on spending bills is likely to be considered. A shutdown in FY 2022 would affect all federal activities covered by discretionary appropriations, as opposed to the most recent FY 2019 shutdown that began in late 2018 and extended into early 2019 that affected departments and agencies covered by the seven appropriations bills that Congress had not yet enacted.

What is a government shutdown?

Many federal government agencies and programs rely on annual funding appropriations passed by Congress. Every year, Congress must pass and the President must sign budget legislation for the next fiscal year, consisting of 12 appropriations bills, one for each Appropriations subcommittee. Congress has not yet enacted any of the 12 bills for FY 2022 that make up the discretionary spending budget. In a “shutdown,” federal agencies must discontinue all non-essential discretionary functions until new funding legislation is passed and signed into law. Essential services continue to function, as do mandatory spending programs.

What services are affected in a shutdown and how?

Each federal agency develops its own shutdown plan, following guidance released in previous shutdowns and coordinated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The plan identifies which government activities may not continue until appropriations are restored, requiring furloughs and the halting of many agency activities. Essential services – many of which are related to public safety – continue to operate, with payments covering any obligations incurred only when appropriations are enacted. In prior shutdowns, border protection, in-hospital medical care, air traffic control, law enforcement, and power grid maintenance have been among the services classified as essential, while some legislative and judicial staff have also been largely protected. Mandatory spending not subject to annual appropriations, such as for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, also continues. Other examples of activities that continue are those funded by permanent user fees that are not subject to appropriations, such as immigration services funded by visa fees.

Although many programs are exempt, the public is still likely to feel the impact of a shutdown in a number of ways. For example, in a full shutdown:

Social Security and Medicare : Checks are sent out, but benefit verification as well as card issuance would cease. While unlikely to happen again, during the 1995-1996 shutdown more than 10,000 Medicare applicants were temporarily turned away every day of the shutdown.

: Checks are sent out, but benefit verification as well as card issuance would cease. While unlikely to happen again, during the 1995-1996 shutdown more than 10,000 Medicare applicants were temporarily turned away every day of the shutdown. Environmental and Food Inspection : In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) halted site inspections for 1,200 different sites that included hazardous waste, drinking water, and chemical facilities, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) delayed almost 900 inspections. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the FDA restored some food inspections a few weeks into the funding lapse for products that were considered high-risk.

National Parks : During the 2013 shutdown, the National Park Service turned away millions of visitors to more than 400 parks, national monuments, and other sites. The National Park Service estimated that the shutdown led to more than $500 million of lost visitor spending nationwide. Many parks remained open during the 2018-2019 shutdown, though no visitor services were provided and damage and trash build-up were reported at many sites nationwide.

Air Travel : During the 2018-2019 shutdown, air travel was strained as a result of air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents working without pay. Travelers faced longer lines as some TSA agents did not report to work and security checkpoints were closed, while the absence of 10 air traffic controllers temporarily stopped travel at LaGuardia Airport and caused delays at several major airports.

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) : In the event of a shutdown, the IRS would not be able to provide its normal service of verifying income and Social Security numbers. In 2013, a backlog of 1.2 million such requests delayed mortgage and other loan approvals, and billions of dollars of tax refunds were also delayed. At least 26,000 furloughed IRS employees were recalled to work during the 2018-2019 shutdown in preparation for tax season, but 14,000 did not show up to work without pay.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP): Though funding for the SNAP program is mandatory, the ability to send out “food stamp” benefits could be affected by a shutdown, since continuing resolutions have generally only authorized the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to send out benefits for 30 days after a shutdown begins. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the USDA paid February SNAP benefits early on January 20, just before the 30-day window ended, but it would have been unable to pay March benefits had the shutdown continued. In addition, during any shutdown, stores are not able to renew their Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card licenses, so those whose licenses expire would not be able to accept SNAP benefits during a shutdown.

Is the government preparing for a shutdown?

OMB maintains a list of the various contingency plans federal agencies will follow during a shutdown. Most have been updated within the past three years, but some have not been updated since a shutdown threat in late 2015.

How would federal employees be affected?

A full shutdown would be more extensive than the partial shutdown that started in December 2018 when Congress had enacted 5 of the 12 appropriations bills. A full shutdown would likely be similar to recent ones in 2013 and early 2018 when approximately 850,000 out of 2.1 million non-postal federal employees were furloughed. In 2013, most of the 350,000 civilian employees at the Department of Defense were summoned back to work within a week. Furloughed employees are not allowed to work and do not receive paychecks but are guaranteed back pay due to legislation passed in January 2019. Federal contractors have historically not received back pay.

At the beginning of the partial 2018-2019 shutdown, an estimated 380,000 employees were furloughed, a smaller number than usual since large federal employers such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense were already funded. Another 420,000 employees reported to work but did not receive pay until the shutdown ended. As the 2018-2019 shutdown continued, departments and agencies such as the IRS and State Department recalled an increasing number of employees.

How and why do mandatory programs continue during a shutdown?

Whereas discretionary spending must be appropriated every year, mandatory spending is authorized either for multi-year periods or permanently. Thus, mandatory spending generally continues during a shutdown. However, some services associated with mandatory programs may be diminished if there is a discretionary component to their funding. For instance, during the 1996 shutdowns and the 2013 shutdown, Social Security checks continued to go out. However, staff who handled new enrollments and other services, such as changing addresses or handling requests for new Social Security cards, were initially furloughed in 1996. In 2013, certain activities were discontinued, including verifying benefits and providing new and replacement cards, but processing of benefit applications or address changes continued. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the Department of Agriculture had to rely on a special authority included in the previous CR to allow them to continue to issue SNAP benefits.

How many times has the government shut down?

Since Congress introduced the modern budget process in 1976, there have been 20 “funding gaps,” including the 2018-2019 shutdown and the one in January 2018, when funds were not appropriated for at least one day. (The hours-long lapse in appropriations in February 2018, though sometimes characterized as a shutdown, did not result in federal employee furloughs.) However, before 1980, the government did not shut down but rather continued normal operations through six funding gaps. Since 1981, 10 funding gaps of three days or fewer have occurred, mostly over a weekend when government operations were only minimally affected.

There have now been four “true” shutdowns where operations were affected for more than one business day. The first two happened in the winter of 1995-1996 when President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress were unable to agree on spending levels and the government shut down twice, for a total of 26 days. The third was in 2013 when a House and Senate standoff over funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) resulted in a 16-day shutdown. The fourth shutdown, starting in December 2018 and continuing into January 2019, centered on a dispute over border wall funding and was the longest-lasting shutdown at 35 days.

Does a government shutdown save money?

While estimates vary widely, evidence suggests that shutdowns tend to cost, not save, money for a number of reasons. For one, putting contingency plans in place has a real cost. In addition, many user fees and other charges are not collected during a shutdown, and federal contractors sometimes include premiums in their bids to account for uncertainty in being paid. While many federal employees are forced to be idle during a shutdown, they have historically received and are now guaranteed back pay, negating much of those potential savings. OMB official estimates of the 2013 government shutdown found that $2.5 billion of pay and benefits were paid to furloughed employees for hours not worked during the shutdown, as well as roughly $10 million of penalty interest payments and lost fee collections.

Shutdowns also carry a cost to the economy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the 2018-2019 shutdown reduced Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by a total of $11 billion, including $3 billion that will never be recovered. On top of that effect, CBO notes that longer shutdowns negatively affect private-sector investment and hiring decisions as businesses cannot obtain federal permits and certifications, or access federal loans. A 2019 Senate report found that the three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018, and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion.

How can Congress avoid a shutdown?

There are essentially two ways to avoid a government shutdown – by passing appropriations or a continuing resolution (see question on “What is a Continuing Resolution?”). Theoretically, the House and Senate Appropriations committees are supposed to pass 12 different appropriations bills that are broken up by subject area and based on funding levels allocated in a budget resolution. Often, these bills are combined into larger “omnibus” or “minibus” legislation.

To avoid a shutdown, Congress would need to pass all 12 appropriations bills through both chambers and get them signed by the President before October 1. This could be done by enacting each bill individually or by packaging them together through an omnibus or minibus. On September 21, the House passed a continuing resolution that would extend current funding levels through December 3 and suspend the debt limit until near the end of 2022. Senate action is uncertain, however, due to the lack of needed Republican support for raising the debt limit under regular Senate rules as well as specific funding disagreements, including appropriations for the Iron Dome missile defense system in Israel. For more about the status of specific appropriations bills, see Appropriations Watch: FY 2022.

What is a Continuing Resolution (CR)?

A continuing resolution temporarily funds the government in the absence of full appropriations bills, often by continuing funding levels from the prior year. Traditionally, CRs have been used to give lawmakers a short period of time to complete their work on remaining appropriations bills while keeping the government open. CRs sometimes apply to only a few categories of spending, but they can also be used to fund all discretionary functions and can be used for an entire year.

CRs differ from normal appropriations bills in that they often “continue” funding allocations from previous bills at the prior year’s rate or through a formula based on the prior year’s rate. Even when overall funding levels have differed, lawmakers have often simply scaled up all accounts by a percent change in spending rather than making individual decisions on spending accounts. However, CRs often do include certain “anomalies,” where specific items are increased or decreased to work around some problems that would occur from continuing the previous year’s policies, or “policy riders,” where certain funding restrictions are specified in order to dictate policy. Colloquially, a “clean CR” does not contain policy riders or politically motivated changes to funding levels.

How often does Congress pass CRs?

Congress frequently passes CRs when lawmakers are unable to agree on appropriations before a deadline, and occasionally multiple CRs are necessary to fund the government for an entire fiscal year. Congress also sometimes relies on CRs during presidential transition years. In FY 2001, for example, a series of intense congressional negotiations leading up to the 2000 election led to a series of 10 one-day CRs. In total, Congress funded the first three months of that fiscal year with 21 continuing resolutions.

Not surprisingly, CRs have been quite prevalent recently and were used to fund the government entirely in FY 2011, when eight CRs were passed, and in FY 2013, when two CRs were passed. In fiscal years 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2020, and 2021, CRs were used to fund the government for roughly a quarter of each year. FY 2017 funding negotiations necessitated three CRs before the passage of an omnibus appropriations bill in May 2017, and FY 2018 negotiations required five CRs before the passage of an omnibus in March 2018. In FY 2019, a CR was used for seven of the 12 appropriations bills for more than one-third of the year before the enactment of an omnibus in February 2019, while the remaining five appropriations bills were funded before the fiscal year began. The most recent year when a full-year appropriations bill passed before the fiscal year began and no CRs were necessary was FY 1997.

What are the disadvantages of using CRs?

Continuing resolutions have several negative implications for the budget’s overall efficiency. CRs usually continue funding at the past year’s level without any regard for changing policy needs or the value of each program within an agency. Using a continuing resolution wastes hundreds of hours of careful consideration and program evaluation incorporated into each agency’s budget submission. For instance, the President’s annual budget proposes a list of eliminations and reductions of programs that are duplicative or ineffective; a continuing resolution will continue to fund these unwanted programs. Finally, the use of continuing resolutions disrupts activities within agencies, makes it difficult to plan or start future projects, and costs staff time to revise work plans every time the budget changes.

How is Congress addressing funding?

Although Congress has not yet enacted any appropriations bills as of mid-September, the House has passed nine out of 12 appropriations bills. The full Senate has not yet taken any action on appropriations for FY 2022, despite the Senate Appropriations Committee reporting out three of its bills. The House and Senate would have to agree on and pass the same versions of the bills before they are presented to the President for his signature. Congress is expected to consider a continuing resolution that would extend funding, largely at current levels, to allow more time to complete appropriations. For more about the status of specific appropriations bills, see Appropriations Watch: FY 2022.

How does a shutdown differ from a default?

In a shutdown, the federal government temporarily stops paying employees and contractors who perform government services, whereas in a default the list of parties not paid is much broader. In a default, the government exceeds the statutory debt limit and is unable to pay some of its creditors (or other obligations). Without enough money to pay its bills, all of the federal government’s payments are at risk — including all government spending, mandatory payments, interest on our debts, and payments to U.S. bondholders. While a government shutdown would be disruptive, a government default could be disastrous. For more on a default, see our Q&A: Everything You Should Know About the Debt Ceiling.)

How does a shutdown differ from “sequestration” or “sequester”?

A government shutdown closes down non-essential government operations due to a lack of funding, whereas a sequester or sequestration is shorthand for the reductions in discretionary spending caps that were in place up until the most recent fiscal year that constrained the total amount of funding for annually appropriated programs.

The first example of sequestration was included in the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The most recent version of sequestration, a product of the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011, resolved the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations. The BCA created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the “Super Committee”) to identify at least $1.5 trillion of deficit reduction over 10 years, and set in motion the sequester if it did not identify at least $1.2 trillion. The failure of the Super Committee triggered sequestration, causing discretionary spending caps to be automatically lowered for both defense and non-defense. Congress has never allowed the full sequester to take effect, passing partial sequester relief in 2013 and 2015, and more than fully reversing the sequester in 2018 and 2019. If appropriations bills violated the increased spending caps, then across-the-board cuts would have been triggered.

So, how much will these bacon-filled burgers set you back?

The Big Mac with bacon costs £3.09 and will include two slices of streaky bacon (the original Big Mac without bacon is still available).

As you might have guessed, the Grand Big Mac is a bigger version of the Big Mac.

It consists of sesame topped buns, two beef patties, two slices of cheese, lettuce, onions, Big Mac sauce and bacon and costs £4.08.

Meanwhile, the Mac Junior is a small version of the Big Mac and is made up of just one beef patty, a slice of cheese, lettuce, onion, pickles and Big Mac sauce, sandwiched together in a sesame topped bun. It is priced at £2.29.

The bacon-filled Big Mac, Grand Mac and the Mac Junior will only be available in restaurants nationwide until 19 March, so you’ll want to get your greasy mitts on the limited-edition burgers pronto.

Michelle Graham-Clare, head of marketing at McDonald’s UK & Ireland, said: “The customer reaction to our Grand Big Mac and Mac Jr last year was phenomenal, the love for the iconic Big Mac surpassed all expectations.

“Which is why I am delighted to introduce bacon to the Big Mac range, a twist on a classic.”

On 29 January, participating McDonald’s restaurants in US will also offer customers free bacon in a launch dubbed “Bacon Hour”.

Diners will be able to add bacon, without charge, on the side with any menu item for one full hour from 4-5pm, local time.

The Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, a Pennsylvania McDonald’s franchise owner, who wanted to create a hamburger big enough to feed hungry steel workers who arrived at his restaurant after work.

Delligatti came up with the burger – that included two beef patties – and served it for the first time in his Uniontown, Pennsylvania, McDonald’s in 1967.

Ever since Prince Philip had his car accident, there's been a lot of ~chatter~ about the fact that the royal family often don't wear seat belts. In fact, Queen Elizabeth was seen driving sans seat belt in the wake of Philip's accident, which is pretty, uh...questionable.

The thing is, the royal fam actually has a good-ish reason for being so unsafe. And ironically that reason has to do with their own personal safety. Speaking to Hello Magazine, former royal protection officer Simon Morgan explained that sometimes royals don't wear seat belts in order to escape quickly in an emergency.

""There are always anomalies,"" Morgan said. ""In the threat and risk matrix it's a matter of looking at each individual situation to decide what is the best way of achieving what needs to be achieved. For example, considering that a quick entry or exit to a vehicle is easier when people aren't strapped into seat belts.""

He added, ""Also, what is significant about this event or situation? Is an individual's look and appearance important? And also an individual's choice. Protection is a very unique area of policing and there are a lot grey areas, but you are always judging each situation to weigh up the risks and threats with the outcomes you are trying to achieve.""

Guess that settles that! But for what it's worth, the younger royals know whattup:

Now, a study published in The Astrophysical Journal has used the planet’s rings to answer a surprisingly frustrating question: How long is a day on Saturn? The answer: 10 hours, 33 minutes, and 38 seconds.

3:51

This revelation is important because it’s “a fundamental property of any planet in the solar system,” notes University of Iowa physicist Bill Kurth, who worked on NASA’s Cassini mission to Saturn but who was not on the study team. Knowing how long a given planet’s day lasts can help with interpreting its gravitational field and its internal structure. But for the ringed planet, it’s a variable that astronomers have been struggling with for decades.

“Saturn is the only planet whose rotation is hard to measure,” says Matthew Tiscareno, a senior research scientist at the SETI Institute who wasn’t part of the new study. He explains that the terrestrial planets have surface features that can be tracked. The other three gas giants don’t, but they have tilted magnetic fields that wobble as these planets rotate, and the disturbances can be used to work out each planet’s rate of rotation.

Saturn, however, wasn’t playing ball. The gassy world’s swirling, chaotic clouds mean that no surface features can be properly tracked. At the same time, several spacecraft orbiting Saturn have confirmed that its magnetic field is freakishly on-the-level, aligned near-perfectly with its rotational pole. That means its rotation doesn’t cause any measurable change in its magnetic field.

The snare drum of the solar system

For years, it wasn’t clear how to solve this conundrum. Then, a research team led by Christopher Mankovich, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, had an idea.

Saturn’s rings are far from static. They sometimes ripple or experience waves, normally when orbiting moons tug at them as they pass near all that ice and dust. But these waves can also be triggered by the oscillations of material deep within Saturn’s enigmatic interior. If a moving mass creates localized changes in the planet’s gravitational field, then that pulls at the rings, too.

It’s a bit like a snare drum: Something rocks the main instrument, and the snare shakes in response.

“Although you can't hear its oscillations, Saturn is very much like a musical instrument,” Mankovich explains. “Its timbre, as in the set of allowed frequencies for its oscillations, is dictated by its overall structure: its size, shape, composition, temperature, and so on.”

It doesn’t take much effort to trigger those waves. If a mass equal to one of Saturn’s moderate-size moons shifts around within the planet, it can cause part of the rings to slosh back and forth. If this sloshing matches up with the frequency of the ring’s orbit, it resonates, turning a small slosh into a clearly observable spiral wave.

Saturn is very much like a musical instrument.

The properties of these waves depend on what they are travelling through and what generated them. With this in mind, Mankovich’s team created a bespoke numerical model, designed to use the ring waves to work out what the interior structure of Saturn must be like. Their model not only revealed some of the planet’s inner workings, but it also managed to finally calculate the length of a Saturnian day.

The team has done “a careful and reliable job” at solving this persistent query, Tiscareno says.

A beast of a space probe

So, what took so long? The fact that Saturn’s internal mass and its errant behavior can cause ring waves was first evidenced in the early 1990s, says Tiscareno. And a series of recent studies led by the University of Idaho’s Matthew Hedman further built on the notion to develop what the team refers to as kronoseismology, or the ability to see what’s happening inside Saturn using the waves in its rings, a concept first suggested in 1982.

Finally cracking the mystery all came down to the late, great Cassini spacecraft, says James O’Donoghue, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center who was not involved in the study.

Plenty of spacecraft have visited Saturn, but Cassini—a “beast of a space probe”—circled the giant world for 13 years with instruments that could watch those rings in unprecedentedly high resolution. That enabled it to see tiny details that are “impossible to achieve” using ground-based telescopes, O’Donoghue says. (See, for instance, evidence from Cassini that the rings are raining on Saturn.)

Even though we know something within the gas giant is causing those ring waves to appear, no one knows what that something could be. One new paper on the preprint site arXiv.org suggests that giant impacts in Saturn’s distant past may to be responsible for “ringing the bell,” so to speak, and sparking the ongoing internal chaos, Mankovich notes.

But for the moment, he says, “the ultimate culprit for those oscillations inside Saturn remains a genuine mystery.”",How long is a day on Saturn? Astronomers just found out.

",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2498887/grandparents-anger-after-their-eight-year-old-granddaughters-christmas-bath-set-contained-a-lewd-message/,"A PAIR of grandparents were left disgusted when their eight-year-old granddaughter opened a bath set they’d given her for Christmas and found a lewd message inside.

Doting Richard Shiner and his wife Tracey were horrified when little Macy asked why the bottle of shower gel instructed her to “invite someone into the shower” with her to enjoy it fully.

The 54-year-old plasterer slammed the crude message and told The Sun: “It’s wrong. If I wanted something like that I’d have gone into an Ann Summers shop.”

He and Tracey, also 54, had given Macy a ‘Little Snow Fairy’ bath set from high street chain Lush - bought from the Chelmsford branch in Essex - because the name made it sound particularly child-friendly.

It contained shower gel and mouldable bath putty, while five-year-old brother Buddy was given a different set containing gel and a bath bomb.

But after Macy had unwrapped her gift at her grandparents’ home in Stanford-le-hope, Essex, on Christmas night, Richard discovered the offensive labelling on the bottle of shower gel.

He said: “My wife spends quite a bit of money in Lush and bought two sets for my two grandchildren.

""It didn’t say anything about age restrictions or anything.

“They opened their bits and pieces on Christmas night, and Macy undid her one.

“It was called ‘Little Snow Fairy’ which to me indicates it’s ideal for kids.

“I happened to pick up the bottle and was reading aloud how to use it.

""The instructions on the shower gel says: ‘How to use: If you really don’t know how to use this, then we suggest you find someone you really like and invite them into the shower with you to demonstrate.’

“I couldn’t believe it said that. Then of course Macy was asking me what it meant.

“I didn’t know what to say to her, so I had to pretend it meant she could bath with Buddy. But that’s not really appropriate either.

""It was the only thing I could think of to say to her at the time.”

Richard says he was so upset he broke the habit of a lifetime and decided to contact the chain’s HQ to complain.

He claims he was told several other customers have made similar complaints about the labelling and added: “I’ve never, ever in my life phoned a company to complain.

“But I phoned up and a girl answered the phone and although she didn’t actually laugh, I could tell from her tone of voice that she thought it was fine.

“I said ‘I don’t think it’s appropriate. It should have an age warning on it.’

“She put me on to the manager and he said, ‘They’re meant to be tongue in cheek.’

“I said to him: ‘It’s wrong. If I wanted something like that, I’d have gone to an Ann Summers shop.’

“And I told him, ‘Innuendo amongst adults is fine, but when you’ve got to explain to an eight-year-old what it means, I think that’s wrong.’

“He said I wasn’t the first person to complain about this - they’ve had four or five complaints over the past couple of years about it, but nothing’s been done about it. And he actually said this batch is aimed at children.

“He did apologise and offered me two free bath bombs, but I said it wasn’t about that - I wanted their labelling to be changed.

""He didn’t even take my name or address though, so I don’t think anything will be done.”

Preparing for a job interview is never easy. There are so many things to consider: Will I be able to answer all the questions? Will I say “like” too much? How do I show off my personality and prove I’m the best candidate for the role? What do I wear? Or perhaps, more importantly, what don’t I wear?

According to various employers, there are a few items one should avoid when it comes to dressing for an interview.

The Absolute No-Nos

The worst offender might not come as a surprise: “Flip-flops,” Andy Limpus, director of talent acquisition at Penske Media Corporation (which owns Women’s Wear Daily and Variety) told HuffPost. “It happens and it’s the craziest thing and I don’t get it.”

Sarah Tam, head of fashion and buying at Rent The Runway, agreed that flip-flops, “under any circumstances, are a no.”

“Wear grown up shoes,” she said. “It’s important.”

Brian Ricci, executive administrator at Rich Brilliant Willing, a New York-based contemporary LED lighting design manufacturer, echoed the sentiment, as did Laurel Pantin, editorial and fashion director at Coveteur.

“Men, I would say absolutely no open-toe anything, ever,” Ricci said. He added that “for women, an open-toe sandal might be totally fine in the right climate.”

“I would say no beachy sandals generally,” Pantin said.

Ricci also advised against wearing any kind of workout gear or yoga pants, as well as anything that appears tattered or has holes in it. (So, yeah, maybe skip the hole-y Yeezy crop top, unless Kanye West himself is doing the interview.) Pantin added that visible bra straps should also be avoided.

Think About Your Scent

“Another thing that people need to think about is not just their clothing but their physical presence,” Limpus said. “What I mean by that is, think about the way you smell. There are people who are wearing too much cologne, there are folks that come to us and they’ve just left lunch and they smell like the restaurant.”

Pantin expressed a similar view, telling HuffPost, “I think a lot of people go very heavy-handed with their personal fragrance and I find that super distracting.”

Tiffanie Lai, people manager at Native Shoes in Vancouver, Canada, recommended erring on the side of caution when it comes to colognes or perfurmes, and perhaps skipping a scent altogether.

“You never know what sensitivities people have, especially when it comes to allergies,” she said.

Know What You’re Applying For

You only have one chance to make a first impression, so you want to make it count. That means when you’re scouring your closet (or store racks) looking for something that’s sure to impress, you need to be mindful of the position you’re applying for. You should also keep in mind where you’re applying, as different work environments have different dress codes.

“If I am interviewing someone for a creative position and they are sitting in front of me in a suit, I’m thinking they don’t really know us,” Limpus said. “If you’re interviewing for a creative job, you’re going to be a little more fashionable and creative in your own style. But if you’re interviewing for an accounting position, I do expect that person in a suit.”

“I think it’s more important to present yourself in a way that best represents the position more so than the company,” he added.

Lai said a good way to determine the vibe or feel of a certain workplace is to tap into your network ― reach out to the hiring manager or a contact who works there ― to see what sort of insight you can get.

Another great tip, especially for jobs that place a lot of emphasis on their social media branding, is to check their Instagram pages. There’s a chance there are office photos and photos of employees, which can give you an idea of the dress code.

Be Confident

If you’re looking for some fail-safe options, Tam suggested blazers, which come in a variety of shapes these days, a crisp white shirt or a chic dress.

As Pantin suggested, “A really great, interesting button-down shirt is always a good choice.”

“You just want to present the most polished version of yourself,” she said.

Tam said that, “regardless of the industry, it’s important to look pulled together and not sloppy. You want an outfit that will help you shine and not outshine you.”

“Most of all, you should probably feel like yourself. Think about how you would like to come across,” Tam added. “It’s important to think about what gives you confidence.”","What Not To Wear To A Job Interview, According To Employers"

Loading…

But while we're all sat there binging on our choccies without even pausing to take a breath, one woman's put us all to shame by managing to hold off on eating an Easter egg for almost 50 YEARS.

The Cadbury Creme Egg now belongs to Ainslie Peters, 48, but it used to be her grandmother's.

Ainslie's grandmother, Jean Peters, was gifted the egg by her future husband, Dan Clark - who gave it to her on their first date back in 1973.

The present clearly won over Jean, who was in her 50s at the time and recently widowed, as the two quickly fell in love and tied the knot the following year.

The egg has remained a treasured family memento, and is kept in a glass cabinet with its foil wrapper still intact.

When Jean died in 2010, the egg was passed on to Ainslie, who keeps it on display at her home in Kirkcaldy, Fife.

She said: ""The egg is just something I remember from all of my childhood visits to see my gran in Glasgow, she kept it in a glass cabinet with her ornaments.

""Me and my three sisters did ask her about it but she would just laugh it off.

""Eventually she told us the story, that Dan had given it to her on their first date.

""My gran died in 2010 and it was the only thing I asked if I could have.""

Ainslie - who doesn't even like Creme Eggs herself - keeps the egg in a cabinet alongside an order of service from her dad's funeral, and a miniature wooden model of the Glasgow skyline.

She added: ""I'm quite a sentimental person.

""I keep stuff just because someone has given it to me.

""My dad's father passed away the year I was born, leaving my gran a widow.

""Dan had also been married before and I think his first wife died too.

""To find love again a couple of years after her husband died must have meant a lot for my gran.""

Jean treasured the Creme Egg, and had taken it with her when she moved from the flat she had shared with Dan in Kilbirnie, North Ayrshire, to sheltered housing.

Sadly, Dan died in 1981 - while Jean lived until the grand age of 94.

Ainslie continued: ""Gran stayed in their flat in Kilbirnie right up until she moved to sheltered housing in 2001 - the Creme Egg went with her.

""When she passed away in 2010 that was the one thing I asked for.

""It's just me being a bit of a daftie.

""I've never peeled the foil back and I wouldn't disturb it.""

The Creme Egg was launched by Cadburys in 1971, not long before Dan decided to give one to Jean.

Parents have the right to choose whatever name they wish for their children, but most of us will have the common sense not to name our kids something that could negatively impact them in life.

And while naming conventions continue to evolve and children with increasingly unusual monikers become more common, there are some words that just don't work as baby names.

One woman on Reddit has found herself battling against her sister when it comes to the name she's chosen for her baby boy, as she believes it will lead to her future nephew being ""mocked"", even if his mum thinks it's ""cool and unique"".

The name? Paradox.

Sharing her story anonymously, the woman explained: ""My sister is eight months pregnant, she told me a few weeks ago that she thinks she wants to name her baby boy Paradox, purely because it sounds cool and it's unique.

""I honest to god thought she was joking.""

The woman has tried texting her sister with alternative names she could pick instead but has left her sibling so angry that she's now been blocked on social media - with her sister ""refusing to acknowledge her existence"".

She added: ""Ever since then I've been texting her a bunch of names, hoping that she'll pick a different one.

""Yesterday she got super annoyed and asked me why I kept suggesting names when she already picked the name, so I had to be honest and I told her that Paradox is not a real name, and she and her son are gonna be mocked. I've genuinely been stressing out about it because I know she is making a massive mistake.

""Now she has blocked me on everything and is refusing to acknowledge my existence.""

The aunt-to-be admitted she understands her sister can name her baby whatever she wants, but at the same time thinks there's ""a line"" when it comes to appropriate monikers.

She said: ""I asked my mum what she thought and she agrees that the name is 'a little out there' but it's my sister's choice at the end of the day. I agree that people have the right to name their kid whatever they want but surely there is a line.""

Commenters on the Reddit post were split on the topic, as while some said she was right to point out how ridiculous she believes the name is, others insisted she should ""drop it"" and let her sister make the final decision.

One person said: ""You’re not the a**hole for letting your sister know your opinion, but you’ve done all you can do at this point. Drop it and let your sister make up her own mind.""

While another added: ""Just because she thinks it makes a cute baby name does not mean it makes a good adult name. That baby is only a baby for a very short time! No one in the adult world is going to take that guy seriously.""

""Even though you are correct and that is a ridiculous thing to call a baby, very few people on this planet want their family's negative feedback on their baby's name"", a third stated.

"""I want this job."" ",https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/the-4-words-far-too-many-people-forget-to-say-in-interviews,"Job searching can feel like a job in and of itself sometimes. Between countless hours scrolling through job listings, perfecting your LinkedIn summary, and drafting a cover letter, it takes a healthy amount of effort just to secure an interview. And once you do make it that first round of interviews, an employer’s final decision depends on what you say, as much as it depends on your job skills.

Surprisingly enough, in between reciting our three strengths and weaknesses and phrasing our salary expectations in a favorable way, many people are forgetting to say “I want this job.”

But why do these four little words matter so much? It is important to explicitly say that you want the job in order to appeal to an interviewer during and after an interview; particularly because it “opens the possibility of asking more important questions,” said human resources professional Cristian Rennella, questions like “Why do you want to work here?” and “How will this job fit with your professional goals?”

When a candidate is proactive about reiterating that they want the job that they are interviewing for, it also “helps the interview become more efficient and productive” added Renella. And it makes sense. If you can successfully articulate that you both want the job and really sell the reasons why, then you’re one step closer to hopefully securing a job offer.

Keep in mind though, that it’s all about balance, “There’s nothing worse than having negative people on your team, so when recruiting, most people are looking for signs of enthusiasm and positivity,” said Fiona Adler, hiring manager and creator of the Actioned App. And “You don’t want to sound desperate for the job, but you do want to let it be known that this job is a great fit for you and you’d be delighted to be offered the role. “

What keeps more job candidates from saying this four words? It could be an overall lack of interview preparation, or fear of sounding too eager.

“From my personal experience, one of the top reasons candidates don’t move to the next round in an interview (other than cultural fit or rambling) is that they can’t close the interview,” said Sarah Johnston, a former hiring manager and current job search coach.

Many experts seem to prefer a well-informed, well-prepared job candidate, who goes beyond just displaying enthusiasm for a role, according to President of Goldbeck Recruiting Henry Goldbeck, who said that the key lies in “ Not just saying, “I want this Job” but being enthusiastic, confident and informed about the job and what you will be able to accomplish.”

This means being able to explain why you want the job and how you plan to contribute to the company. And the best way to be able to do this is to do thorough research beforehand. Be in the know about a company’s mission, current and past initiatives, and its competitors.

You do actually have to want the job, in order to give a compelling and authentic interview. So be sure that the job is a fit before you say those four words.

Anti-vaxxers. ,https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/theres-a-new-official-major-threat-to-world-health-and-its-completely-ridiculous/,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has released its list of the top 10 dangers they believe to be the biggest threats to health in 2019. On there are many of the usual suspects, including Ebola, which saw several outbreaks in 2018, and dengue, which infects around 390 million people a year, as well as the likelihood the world will face another global influenza pandemic.

Joining these hard-to-tackle threats this year is one entirely preventable. Yes, the WHO have decided to add anti-vaxxers to the list of the biggest threats to world health.

VACCINE HESITANCY

Measles has seen a resurgence, with a global increase of 30 percent, despite vaccines to prevent measles being introduced in 1963 and the vaccine only being improved since then. An outbreak in Europe affected more than 41,000 people in 2018, up from just over 5,000 in 2016.

Rather than list the diseases themselves (although it also mentions the HPV vaccine and poliovirus) as threats to the world's health, the WHO has added the anti-vaccine movement itself as a threat.

""Vaccine hesitancy – the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines – threatens to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases,"" they write in their release. ""Some countries that were close to eliminating [diseases] have seen a resurgence.

""Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease – it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved.""

As well as anti-vaxxers, the WHO outlined these nine other threats to world health (in no particular order) that they will try to tackle in 2019:

Air pollution and climate change

The WHO list air pollution as the greatest environmental risk to health. Nine out of 10 people worldwide breathe polluted air every day, with around 7 million people dying prematurely every year as a result.

Non-communicable diseases

Chronic, non-transmittable diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are the leading cause of mortality, causing 70 percent of deaths worldwide. Of the 41 million people a year who die due to non-communicable diseases, 15 million people die prematurely (aged between 30 and 69).

The WHO say that a rise in these diseases has been driven by the use of alcohol and tobacco, unhealthy diets and inactivity, and air pollution.

Global influenza pandemic*

""The world will face another influenza pandemic – the only thing we don’t know is when it will hit and how severe it will be,"" the WHO write about one of the most unpredictable threats on the list.

""Global defences are only as effective as the weakest link in any country’s health emergency preparedness and response system.""

An estimated 6.2 to 7.3 million people in the US have gotten sick from the flu during the 2018/19 flu season so far, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

*Before you all nitpick and say that all pandemics are global, this is the way it was described by the World Health Organization and who are we to argue with the WHO?

Fragile and vulnerable settings

Over 6.1 billion people live in unstable environments, where crises (such as war and mass population displacement) can leave them without adequate food, water, or basic medical care.

Ebola and other high-threat pathogens

The Democratic Republic of Congo saw several Ebola outbreaks last year, which spread to densely populated cities, making the epidemics even more difficult to tackle.

As well as Ebola, the WHO list SARS, Zika, Nipah, and the ominously-named ""disease X"" as pathogens that we need to prepare properly for. Before you panic and think you have symptoms, ""disease X"" is a codename for an as-yet-unknown disease that could arise and spread through the population.

Antimicrobial resistance

The WHO have been quick to sound the alarm on antibiotic resistance, and this year it makes the list of biggest threats to humanity once again.

""A post-antibiotic era – in which common infections and minor injuries can kill – far from being an apocalyptic fantasy, is instead a very real possibility for the 21st Century,"" the WHO warned in 2014. Other than a few promising studies on new types of antibiotics, not much has changed and alarming scenarios for what happens when antibiotics stop working still loom large.

Dengue

With 40 percent of the population at risk of dengue fever, it remains one of the biggest threats to world health. The mosquito-borne disease kills up to 20 percent of people with severe forms of the disease, mainly occurring during rainy seasons in countries like India and Bangladesh.

HIV

Progress tackling HIV has been enormous, but still nearly a million people a year die of HIV and/or AIDS. With more than 37 million people living with the infection, the WHO remains committed to tackling it head-on.

One of the biggest problems in doing so is reaching groups around the world often excluded from health systems, such as ""sex workers, people in prison, men who have sex with men, or transgender people"". This year they warn that young women and girls are increasingly at risk of contracting HIV, citing that one-in-four HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa occurs in this group, despite the fact they only make up 10 percent of the population.

Weak primary health care

Many low-middle income countries around the world do not yet have adequate primary health care (the first point of contact people have with their health system) and it's putting lives at risk. In a global conference in 2018, all countries committed to improving primary health care. The WHO will work with countries and organizations to help improve this vital first port of call.","There's A New Official Major Threat To World Health, And It's Completely Preventable"

A study published today in the Science Advances journal suggests that elderly Facebook users in the U. S. were far more likely to share false and misleading news stories than any other age group.

The study, conducted by researchers at New York University and Princeton University, focused on Facebook activity in the months surrounding the election. The team started by gathering a panel of 3,5000 Facebook users and non-users in spring of 2016. Right after the presidential election, researchers requested that the Facebook users in that group install an app that shared their Facebook data, including political and religious views, with researchers. Facebook approved the app to be used for research. Almost half of the participants who were Facebook users consented to sharing their profile data.

In the following months, researchers monitored the links participants posted on Facebook. They compared those links with a list of websites based on the fake news sites list that BuzzFeed assembled for its in-depth analysis on how “fake news” outperformed “real news” on Facebook prior to the election.

The study found that more than 90 percent of participants didn’t share any links from the sites included in the “fake news” list. But most people who did share articles on the “fake news” list were older than 65.

The results also show that people who identified as Republican and conservative were more likely to share false and misleading stories than Democrats and liberals (18 percent versus 3.5 percent). However—while researchers did try to remove partisan web sites from their list (like Breitbart)—many of the web sites included on the list were being used to spread pro-Trump and anti-Clinton propaganda.

Reached by Gizmodo, Facebook did not want to comment on the study itself. But a spokesperson shared information on the company’s efforts to provide context that’s intended to help users check the validity of stories in their feeds. They also shared information on research showing how Facebook’s efforts are apparently helping to address the false news problem.

Of course, a lot has happened in the online and media landscape since 2016. As the authors of the study wrote in a Washington Post op-ed about their research, “Our results focus on social media behavior from over two years ago. Online, that’s virtually an eternity.”



In the Washington Post article, they also acknowledge they “don’t know whether ‘being old’ is associated with sharing more fake news, or if it’s being in the generation born before 1950"" and they can’t say “whether people raised in the modern digital environment—digital natives—will share more fake news as they age.”

Hopefully, research like this will help social networks figure out where to focus their efforts in the ongoing and potentially futile war on bullshit.

[Science Advances, Verge, Washington Post]",You'll Never Guess What Group of People Shared the Most Fake News Around the 2016 Election
AirPods. ,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-airpods-review-vs-xiaomi-airdots-2019-1,"Apple AirPods have a low-price competitor: Xiaomi came out with $30 knockoffs called AirDots that are currently only available in China.

We tried the AirDots to see how they compared against Apple's $159 AirPods.

Watch the video above to find out if AirPods are worth the cost or if AirDots provide the same quality wireless headphones for a fraction of the price.

These are AirPods, Apple's $159 wireless headphones and these are AirDots, Xiaomi's $30 wireless headphones.

Xiaomi has long been referred to as the Apple of China. So we wanted to know, how do the headphones compare? Are AirPods worth the cost? Or can AirDots provide the same quality for one-fifth the price?

Let's start with looks. AirPods weigh approximately 46 grams or 1.6 ounces (4 grams per each AirPod and 38 grams for the case). And the AirDots weigh approximately 39 grams or 1.4 ounces (4.2 grams per each AirDot and 30.6 grams for the case). Both come in a container about the size of a pack of floss .

As for design, AirPods basically look like your normal Apple EarPods without the wire. They're long, sleek, and are generally molded to the shape of an ear. The AirDots look more like hearing aids. They're in-ear headphones that have an oval shape exterior which makes the earbuds bulky and a little bit heavy despite being a fraction of the weight of the AirPods.

Both the AirPods and the AirDots will automatically connect to your Bluetooth device when you put them in your ear. The AirPods do connect a little faster to your iPhone because it's an Apple product, but the AirDots still connect pretty quickly. Bluetooth, in general, is still an issue. I've had my AirPods glitch on me one or two times before. The sound would go in and out and there was one instance where only one of my AirDots was connected.

The AirPods are pretty comfortable and require very little effort to place in your ear. AirDots, on the other hand, require a bit more effort to stick them in your ear. Since they're in-ear headphones, the silicone rubber earbuds can be uncomfortable to wear. You might feel like your ears are clogged, as if you're in an airplane or underwater and they might take some time to fit and adjust in your ears. However, once they are in there, they rarely fall out no matter how hard you shake your head.

Moving on to the most important part, the sound quality. AirPods don't have a noise-canceling feature but music still sounds crisp and there's a decent bass. AirDots have a really good noise-canceling feature, a powerful bass, and clear sound. Unlike the headphones that sit in the outer ear, these earbuds extend into your ear canal, blocking out most sound from your surroundings. While this can provide you with some high-quality music, it might not be good if you like hearing everything around you. I wore them while walking down the busy streets of New York City and I couldn't hear any honking cars or the loud crowd.

You can also make phone calls on both devices. AirPods filter out the background noise pretty well and are able to emphasize the person's voice, but AirDots have limitations. You can hear a lot of background noise, like ruffling sounds from your clothes and your footsteps, which is distracting when you have to take a call on the go. If you use earbuds a lot for phone calls, you might wanna stay away from AirDots, despite them being good at blocking background noise while listening to music.

To end a phone call, you have to double tap your AirPods. For AirDots, you can single tap. You can also single tap either side of your AirDots to play a song, pause a song, or double tap to open voice assistant. While single tapping sounds like a more simple gesture it can actually be an issue. You could be adjusting your AirDots in your ear but it would register it as a tapping motion on the headphones. AirPods, on the other hand, offer a double tap feature that you can customize for each bud. You can set one AirPod to play the next or the previous track and the other pair to pause a song, open Siri, or turn the feature off completely. Taking one AirPod out of your ear also stops the music from playing.

These headphones also offer similar ranges. Apple claims the AirPods have a range of about 12 meters or 40 feet while Xiaomi says the AirDots can reach about 10 meters or 32 feet.

As for battery life, AirPods can last up to 5 hours of constant listening while AirDots can last up to 4 hours. Both devices come with a case that charges them. However, the AirPods will show you the battery percentage for both the case and the headphone on your phone while the AirDots will only show you the battery icon on your connected mobile device. There are lights on both headphones that indicate when they're charging. The AirPods use the same lightning cable as your iPhone so you don't have to worry about carrying another cable to charge them, whereas the AirDots use a micro USB cable.

Overall, for $30, I say the AirDots are a great deal. They're a solid set of wireless headphones that have most of the features of the AirPods at a fraction of the price. But if you don't mind the high price tag, want the customization of AirPods, and are already in Apple's ecosystem, the AirPods may be the way to go.",We compared Apple's $159 AirPods to Xiaomi's $30 AirDots and the winner was clear

"""These were spotted in the refrigerated section at Walmart"" ",https://www.bustle.com/p/pokemon-sugar-cookie-dough-from-pillsbury-just-hit-shelves-heres-where-to-find-it-15578531,"Since the late 2010s have essentially just become the '90s all over again, it's only fitting that the Pokémonaissance that started with ""Pokémon Go"" in 2016 has only grown stronger since. While we still have plenty to occupy us Pokémon-wise with the app still in full swing (looking at you, family members still on it) and the new games on Nintendo Switch, the latest Pokémon trend is a little more hands-on and a LOT more delicious: Pillsbury has Pokemon sugar cookie dough that comes in little shapes inspired by the iconic card game/television series/pseudo-religion you followed in the '90s. Now you can make your whole kitchen smell like that time your elementary school teachers banned you from trading cards during recess all over again!

The cookies were spotted in the refrigerated section of Walmart by Instagram account @snackspy. Per the image, the cookies come pre-cut in packages of 24, with half of them in the shape of Pokéballs and the other half with an outline of your favorite sassy electric mouse. It's worth noting that they don't appear to have hit Walmart's website yet, and that availability may be a little limited as of right now — as dorky as it is to admit, I went looking for these at my local Walmart and they weren't on shelves yet — but hopefully, considering the demand for all things Pokémon, these cookies will see a wider rollout soon. I mean, just look at them. What self-respecting '90s kid wouldn't want it in their lives?

These cookies are far from the only thing that Pokemon lovers have to look forward to in 2019. Those of us keeping up with our favorite fictional creatures are well-aware that another Pokémon movie is on the way. Remember in 2017, when everyone flipped their lids because Pikachu spoke human words to Ash at the end of Pokémon: I Choose You!? Turns out we as a society are leaning right into that weirdness, if the upcoming trailer for Detective Pikachu, slated for a May 2019 release, is any indication. Ryan Reynolds plays the lead as one gloriously sarcastic Pikachu, who speaks more English in the trailer than I possibly do in an entire day (though, to be fair, he is technically speaking in Pokémon; only one human seems to be able to understand him).

All this is to say, if you are unnerved by the idea of a talking Pikachu and unsure with how you're going to cope with it psychologically come 2019, it looks like you'll be able to take the edge off with these new cookies from Pillsbury. Pop them in the oven, bake, and forget. And if that doesn't work, well — you can always see if that ""Pokémon Go"" dating app is still functioning. If you're going to be scarred for life by Ryan Reynolds playing a foot-tall mouse, you might as well do it with a buddy.

In the meantime, if you're looking for these cookies, keep an eye out at your local Walmart — even if you don't spot them, there's plenty of Pokémon stuff there for you to blow all your Pokémon Dollars on in the Year Of Our CGI Pikachu 2019.",Pokemon Sugar Cookie Dough From Pillsbury Just Hit Shelves — Here's Where To Find It
Gluten-Free Caramel Chocolate Chip. ,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/introducing-newest-brownie-inspired-girl-161500977.html,"Sorry Samoas, Thin Mints and Tagalongs—there’s a new cookie in town and we can’t wait to get our hands on it. With the start of 2022’s cookie season, The Girl Scouts just launched their newest addition to the cookie fam, Adventurefuls.

Per a press release, the new biscuit is described as an “indulgent brownie-inspired cookie with caramel-flavored crème and a hint of sea salt.” The dessert is topped with extra chocolate drizzle for good measure. Frankly, we’re surprised the organization didn’t come up with a brownie-like flavor sooner, considering an entire rank of young scouts in the organization are known as “Brownies.” Nevertheless, we got a sneak peek of the new treat, and it’s just as delicious as it sounds. The texture of the cookie is crisp and light, while the decadent caramel crème offers smooth, sweet-and-salty contrast.

The unique name is tied to the organization’s overall mission. “Adventurefuls take cookie lovers on a delicious taste adventure, just like Girl Scouts take on their own amazing adventures all year long,” part of the release reads.

The new flavor is the first to launch since the company introduced the Toast-Yay!, a French toast-flavored cookie shaped like a miniature piece of bread, at the start of 2021. The newest addition joins the yummy lineup of cookies including Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoas, Do-si-dos, Trefoils, Lemon-Ups and Toffee-tastics.

There are a few routes you can take to order your faves. If you know a Girl Scout, reach out to her to find out how she’s selling her spoils this year. If you don’t know one, visit the Girl Scout cookie website or use the official Girl Scout Cookie Finder app to spot a cookie booth near you (if there are any in your area). Starting February 18, you can simply enter your zip code into the online Cookie Finder to buy from a local troop or donate them to first responders and local causes.

Even cooler, you’ll also be able to snag sweets via DoorDash this year. Download the app and search ""Girl Scouts"" to see if on-demand delivery is available yet in your area.

Prenatal screening tests and neutral counseling. ,https://didyouknowfacts.com/iceland-eliminated-downs-syndrome-complicated/,"If you’ve ever been pregnant, then you’ve probably had the discussion with your partner (or other trusted confidantes) on whether to have the optional testing that reveals potential birth defects around the midway point. It’s offered (but not required) in the United States, and one of the most common defects discovered is a likelihood of Down’s Syndrome.

In the U.S., around 67% of women who receive a positive diagnosis for their child choose to terminate their pregnancy. In Iceland, that number is nearly 100%, a fact that has resulted in the defect being all but eradicated in the island nation. They only see about 2 cases per year.

Despite claims that the abortions are forced by the Icelandic government, the truth is that the women receive neutral counseling and make their own decisions. That said, there are those who believe strongly that, despite the often poor prognosis and the lifelong financial cost and emotional toll of taking care of a child with Down’s, the lives of those with Down’s should be valued by society.

As with all debate surrounding the ideas of eugenics, genetic choices, and abortion, there are strong opinions on both sides of the issue. For now, women in both Iceland and the United States appear to be able to make the decision that’s best for them and their families.

Which is maybe the best place to start.

No. ,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/animals-birds-holiday-culture-christmas,"The lucky recipient in the classic Christmas carol ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" got 23 birds over the course of the holiday season.

Hopefully they didn’t live in a studio apartment.

In the yuletide spirit, we’re taking a closer look at the birds immortalized in the English folk song, first published around 1780.

Seven Swans A-Swimming

There are eight species of swans worldwide, and the most common species in England is the mute swan. The classy birds, inspirations for European fariytales, are popular exports and are often seen a-swimming in park lakes in North America.

Generally “swans mate for life,"" and couples have an endearing ""habit of swimming side-by-side,"" says J.V. Remsen, curator of birds at the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science. (Watch a mute swan ""windsurf"" across a lake.)

Six Geese A-Laying

It's unknown which geese the song refers to, although several species live in England, including pink-footed geese, barnacle geese, and Canada geese, a non-native species introduced from the U.S.

Geese eggs can provide quite a feast—the eggs of a wild Canada goose, for example, are more than three inches long, while a regular chicken egg is a little over two inches. Domestically a jumbo chicken egg weighs in at 2.5 ounces, while the egg of a Embden goose, a popular domestic breed, is nearly 6 ounces.

Noisy by nature, and with amazing eyesight and hearing, domestic geese have been trained to guard police stations in China. (Related: ""Honk if You Think Geese Are Good Guard Dogs."")

Four Colly Birds

Though most of us sing “four calling birds,” the correct word is actually ""colly,"" according to a 2016 blog post by the Library of Congress.

The word colly is an Old English adjective used to describe something black, like coal. So colly birds likely refer to blackbirds, according to the library. Twenty more and you’ve got a pie.

There is, however, a caveat for those of us in North America, Donald Kroodsma, retired ornithologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, says via email.

""The blackbird of English literature is a close relative of our robin,” which are both part of the thrush family, Kroodsma says, whereas North American blackbirds are part of the icterid family.

And if you prefer calling birds, we asked Kroodsma, author of Listening to a Continent Sing: Birdsong By Bicycle From the Atlantic to the Pacific to choose a favorite.

“What's sweeter than a cardinal song?” he says.

Three French Hens

Most of the birds mentioned in the song are wild species, except for the French hen, ""which is probably a breed of chicken and hence not wild,” says Kathi Borgmann, an ornithologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

The song may refer to the Favorelles chicken, a breed named for the region in France from which they originated in the late 1800s. These large, colorful birds have feathery ear muffs and beards—even the females have beards.

Must be hipster chicks.

Two Turtle Doves

The European turtle dove, a beautiful bird with pink and chestnut colors, is in no way related to turtles, quips Remsen.

Their scientific name is Streptopelia turtur—the latter of which means ""turtle"" in Latin. “So this is truly a curious situation.”

Hear a European Turtle Dove's Call Audio Timeline Slider: Use the left or right arrow keys to decrease or increase the slider value.

Some people believe their reptilian name comes from their call, which makes a ""turr, turr"" sound.

A Partridge in a Pear Tree

Possibly the most famous avian in the Christmas diddy is the partridge.

To most, a partridge probably brings to mind something like the plump little chukar, a partridge native to Eurasia and introduced to North America as a game bird.

There are 92 known species of partridges, which are relatives of quail and live in grasslands the world over.

Sadly, though, the birds are ground nesters, and not ""likely to roost in pear trees,"" says Michael Ward, avian ecologist at the University of Illinois. (See the world's most unusual Christmas trees.)

It's a wolf. ,https://www.foxnews.com/science/mysterious-wolf-like-creature-killed-in-montana-idd-through-dna-test,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) revealed the identity of the mysterious wolf-like creature that was shot dead in the state last month. Officials confirmed in a news release Monday that DNA results proved the animal was a gray wolf.

“The lab compared the animal’s DNA with thousands of other DNA samples from wolves, coyotes and dogs. The conclusion was clear – this animal is a gray wolf from the northern Rocky Mountains,"" the statement read.

Montana FWP officials initially weren’t certain what the creature was when a rancher fatally shot it on his property.

The wildlife agency spoke about the beast, which it said had ""captured the curiosity of the nation.""

""Confusion about the animal might be due to the condition of the animal and the photos, which seemed to show short legs and big ears,"" the agency explained Monday.

STRANGE WOLF-LIKE ANIMAL KILLED IN MONTANA PUZZLES WILDLIFE OFFICIALS

Officials said an inspection of the animal at its laboratory “revealed a relatively normal looking, dark brown wolf.”

Adding, the wolf weighed 84.5 pounds and was around 2 to 3 years old.

“The wolf was a non-lactating female, which means she didn’t have a litter of pups,” they explained, noting that “any unique physical features she has might also appear in her siblings or parents and may continue to be passed along by others in her family.”

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service geneticist Mary Curtis said it’s not unusual for there to be physical variations of animals within a species.

According to undisputed champion Katie Taylor, Conor McGregor does not get much praise from his home of Ireland.

Speaking on The MMA Hour with Ariel Helwani, Taylor discussed the career of McGregor and what he has done for the sport of MMA and Ireland in general. McGregor has helped open the door for other international fighters. Taylor, however, believes that McGregor does not get as much acclaim in Ireland compared to anywhere else. She has compared to him one of the most legendary and influential boxers of all time.

“He’s always been a fantastic support to me, but I think he’s just someone who’s actually transcended the sport,” Taylor stated, via MMA Fighting. “He’s like, for me, the Muhammad Ali of the UFC. He’s just a fantastic athlete. A great businessman as well. But what he’s done in the sport and the UFC has been absolutely incredible, and I don’t think he’s celebrated as much as he should be here in Ireland. I think he is an absolute global superstar and just a phenomenal athlete, and he’s always been a complete gentleman towards me.”

Taylor, a 2012 Olympic gold medalist, made her professional debut in 2016. In her seventh fight, she won the WBA Lightweight Title and has continued to collect gold since. She is the current undisputed lightweight champion and has defended a version of the gold she wears twelve times. Taylor is scheduled to face seven-division champion Amanda Serrano sometime in 2022.

Both fighters trained at Crumlin Boxing Club, and McGregor has been a big supporter of Taylor throughout her career. Taylor’s praise of McGregor’s career results from the success he has had over the years.

Huge congrats Katie Taylor!!! Put that one to bed for sure, no questions! Top drawer stuff as always from Ireland’s greatest! @KatieTaylor ❤️ 🇮🇪 — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) August 22, 2020

McGregor made his professional MMA debut in 2008. A Cage Warriors Lightweight and Featherweight Champion, McGregor joined the UFC in 2013. He became a hot commodity around 2015, winning the UFC Featherweight Title against Jose Aldo in thirteen seconds at UFC 194. His legend grew after two fights with Nate Diaz and things really blew up when he beat Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205 in 2016 for the UFC Lightweight Title. Back then, Irish fans passionately invaded UFC events.

McGregor fought Floyd Mayweather in a boxing bout in 2017, and everything has changed for him since then. He owns a whiskey business and has made a lot of money outside of fighting. Since returning to MMA action in 2018, McGregor is 1-3 in his last four fights. McGregor has lost two in a row to Dustin Poirier, with the last fight at UFC 264 in January where he broke his tibia.

Outside of the octagon, however, has been messy for McGregor. A a UFC 223 media day in Brooklyn in 2018, McGregor invaded the Barclays Center and tried to pick a fight with Khabib Nurmagomedov. He threw a dolly at a bus full of fighters, breaking glass everywhere. He has also had several sexual assault allegations thrown his way (not guilty of any action as of this moment), destroyed a fan's phone in Miami, and famously punched an elderly man in Dublin for turning down a drink at a pub. Recently, he got into an altercation with Machine Gun Kelly and was accused of punching DJ Francesco Facchinetti.

Taylor, however, is looking at his accomplishments within the sport, while understanding how controversial he is outside of it, and what those accomplishments mean to her.

“I just think he’s had a few controversial moments outside of the cage as well that people obviously didn’t appreciate,” Taylor went on to say. “But I’m looking at him as just a phenomenal athlete, and someone who I generally think has transcended the sport, someone who’s become bigger than the sport. Nearly every time he does fight, it’s an absolute huge event. He still gets the highest number of pay-per-view figures and he’s still the highest-paid athlete in the UFC.”

McGregor is expected to return to action sometime in early 2022. It is unknown who he would face in the octagon when he comes back.",'Muhammad Ali of the UFC': Katie Taylor says Conor McGregor is underappreciated in Ireland
Industry standards are eliminating/reducing size of chords to reduce child strangulation. ,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/12/14/corded-blinds-safety-standard-protect-kids-take-effect-saturday/2312707002/,"You won't be able to buy some corded blinds starting Saturday. Here's why

Show Caption Hide Caption New safety ban limits corded blinds to prevent child strangulation Studies show corded blinds pose a serious threat to the safety of children. Now, manufacturers will have new safety standards to follow that will shorten or remove cords from blinds altogether. USA TODAY

A new safety standard will take effect Saturday limiting the manufacturing of corded blinds in response to fears they could injure or kill children by strangulation.

Starting Dec. 15, most products used to cover windows must either be cordless or have short, inaccessible cords.

Details of the ban in corded blinds were revealed in January by the Window Covering Manufacturers Association.

""The new safety standard is a direct result of ongoing industry innovation, technological advances and new product development,"" Ralph Vasami, executive director of the WCMA, said in a statement in January.

The standard will affect more than 80 percent of all window covering products sold in the U.S. and Canada.

According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, there have been 50 fatalities reported between 2012 and 2017 linked to window cord strangulation among infants and young children.

A study published last year in the journal Pediatrics found between 1990 and 2015, about 17,000 children under 6 years old – about two kids a day – went to the emergency room for injuries related to corded blinds.

""A curious child can quickly get entangled in a window blind cord,"" Gary Smith, senior author of the study and director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, said in a statement. ""This can lead to strangulation within minutes, and the parent may not hear a thing because the child often can’t make a sound while this is happening.""

In 2015, the WCMA created a ""Best for Kids"" program to help consumers identify window blinds that were safe in households with kids.

CPSC advises consumers to replace any corded blinds with cordless ones. For households with corded blinds, the CPSC suggests the following tips:

Move any furniture away from windows or cords to make them tougher to reach.

Keep tasseled pull cords as short as possible.

Remove dangling cords, and keep any others out of reach.

Double check cord stops are properly installed to limit their movement.

Keep continuous-loop cords on draperies and vertical blinds anchored to a floor or wall.

They're too busy to clarify. ,https://www.thrillist.com/drink/nation/starbucks-cups-barista-wrong-misspelled-names,"Yang is not alone however: Even popular sports personalities with half a million Twitter followers face the same issue at the coffee chain.

“Even when baristas get the spelling [of my name] right, no one can pronounce it correctly, or refuse to yell it out loud. Most of them read it however they like, and I always miss my order. It's frustrating."" So Yang now gives her name as Superstar, which she says usually gives people a good laugh, and she never misses an order in the process.

That's why many people not named Dave or Jen avoid potential awkwardness by giving baristas a fake name that's super-easy for anyone to spell and say. ""My name is Kun. Just like fun with a ‘K,’” said Kun Yang, a New York City resident. ""That's how my friends introduce me. I use a fake name because I have a name that unfortunately sounds very much like the 'C' word.”

For anyone with an uncommon name, ordering Starbucks coffee can feel a little like the first day of school. They're waiting and hoping the barista doesn't embarrass them by saying their name wrong when they call it out. It can also lead to total confusion when drinks are called out for a person that doesn’t actually exist.

Aside from its strange cup size names and seemingly endless menu of frozen drinks, Starbucks is probably best known for its inability to get its customers’ names right . The chain is so notorious for it that it has become the basis of a number of comedy sketches theorizing that they do it on purpose .

So the real question is, do baristas do this on purpose? Is the chain just playing one long and large prank on coffee drinkers everywhere? Not exactly.

""We have never asked or directed any of our partners to misspell names of our customers for any reason,” a Starbucks spokesperson said. ""Writing names on cups is a fun tradition born out of the relationship and interaction between our employees and customers. Our [baristas] aim to do their best when it comes to spelling the names of our customers, though at times it can be tricky.""

Baristas are also not required to ask for the spelling of your name, which is why it can go so haywire when you order. ""There's no real corporate policy other than that we ask for your name,"" said Tim*, a barista at a Starbucks in Nashville revealed [Editor's Note: The names of the baristas have been changed]. ""We're not required to ask for a spelling. We often do, but it's hit or miss depending on the person working at the time.""

But the main reason baristas get your name is wrong is that they are just insanely busy most of the time. ""When I have 40 people in line, if I took the time to ask every single person on line how to spell their name, it's going to get even longer,"" Lisa*, barista in Dallas noted. So they resort to guessing.

""We're going to get complaints from customers that we're taking too long. It's a matter of expediency,” Lisa said. ""It's often a time thing,"" Tim added. ""Especially in the morning when we've got a line out the door.""

So it's up to you -- do you want your coffee in a minute or two, or do you want your name spelled correctly?

There is one way Starbucks customers can avoid name butchery on their coffee orders. It’s as simple as downloading the Starbucks app. Once you put in your credit card info, you can order a drink and have it appear on the counter of the store closest to you, a place which will inevitably five minutes from anywhere in America. By the time you arrive, it'll be sitting on the counter with your name printed on the sticker exactly as you want it to be spelled because it pulls your name from the app, you dig?

So, for once, Katerina, you can be yourself, and not “Bob.”

Parents aren't vaccinating their children. ,https://www.sciencealert.com/measles-is-making-a-comeback-around-the-world-as-vaccination-rates-languish,"The world has not done enough to improve vaccination coverage, and now, measles is experiencing a resurgence in nearly every corner of the globe.

Last year, the number of reported measles cases spiked by more than 30 percent worldwide, according to a new report from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Experts have been warning for years that something like this could happen. Because even though measles is easily preventable through two doses of a vaccine, we need about 95 percent coverage to stop outbreaks from happening.

Today, that goal is still a ways off. For nearly a decade, we have failed to get vaccination coverage past the 85 percent mark. And after years of languishing, the gaps in vaccination are finally taking their toll.

In 2017, the new report found five out of all six WHO regions in the world experienced an upsurge in measles outbreaks, and that was especially true in the Americas, Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. Only in the Western Pacific did the number of measles cases fall.

""Without urgent efforts to increase vaccination coverage and identify populations with unacceptable levels of under- , or un-immunised children, we risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating, but entirely preventable disease,"" warns Soumya Swaminathan, Deputy Director General for Programmes at WHO.

To really understand what that means for the world, we only have to look back a few generations.

Before 1963, when there was no measles vaccine, the world experienced a major measles outbreak every few years, causing 2.6 million deaths annually.

Five decades later, the world is closer than ever to eliminating this highly contagious and potentially deadly disease. In fact, countries like the US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Japan have already done so, and many more nations are on the brink of doing the same.

The impact of such measures has been extraordinary. Since the turn of the century, the measles vaccine has saved over 21 million lives, decreasing the global death toll by 80 percent in just 17 years.

But after years of progress, things have begun to take a turn for the worst, thanks in large part to a lack of funding and a rise in misinformation.

""The resurgence of measles is of serious concern, with extended outbreaks occurring across regions, and particularly in countries that had achieved, or were close to achieving measles elimination,"" said Swaminathan.

Watching measles make a global comeback is kind of like watching a character in a horror film make dumb decisions in slow motion. As a global community, we have a safe and effective way to eliminate measles at our fingertips and yet we keep failing to use the weapon at hand.

Instead, we are running up the goddamn stairs once again.

In 2017, the report found that 20.8 million infants worldwide failed to receive the first measles vaccine.

""The increase in measles cases is deeply concerning, but not surprising,"" says Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Not surprising, because most public health experts have seen this coming for years. Organisations like WHO and its partners in the Measles & Rubella Initiative have warned before that if vaccination rates aren't strengthened, this preventable-disease could rebound.

But with measles posing much less of a threat today, many nations have become careless in their attempts to ensure its elimination. In addition, false rumours, misconceptions and myths about the vaccine have only served to fuel recent outbreaks.

In Europe, where misinformation about the measles vaccine is particularly evident, vaccination coverage in some areas is less than 70 percent.

""Complacency about the disease and the spread of falsehoods about the vaccine in Europe, a collapsing health system in Venezuela and pockets of fragility and low immunisation coverage in Africa are combining to bring about a global resurgence of measles after years of progress,"" explains Berkley.

The authors of the report are calling for urgent action. They say we need sustained investment so that routine vaccination services can be strengthened, especially among the poorest and most marginalised communities.

At the same time, they argue we also need to ensure public support for immunisations, combatting misinformation and hesitancy around vaccines as much and as soon as possible.

""Existing strategies need to change: more effort needs to go into increasing routine immunisation coverage and strengthening health systems,"" argues Berkley.

""Otherwise we will continue chasing one outbreak after another.""

Florida. ,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/for-americans-looking-for-a-better-life-this-state-is-their-top-destination-2018-12-05,"Looking to get the hell out of Dodge? Then there’s a pretty decent chance you’re headed for Florida.

The Sunshine State ranked as the No. 1 destination among homebuyers who were looking to move across state lines, according a new analysis from LendingTree. All told, 12.4% of all mortgage requests made by out-of-state movers were for homes in Florida.

When the data was adjusted by each state’s population however, South Carolina ranked as the top destination, just ahead of Florida. There were 52% more mortgage loan requests from movers to the Palmetto State than would be expected based on its population.

Other states that saw the greatest influx of residents, not adjusting for state’s population, include Texas, California, Washington, Arizona, Massachusetts and North Carolina. To produce its findings, the researchers reviewed more than 2 million new purchase mortgage-loan requests for primary residences across all 50 states in 2018.

Don’t miss:Why 2019 won’t lead to a home buyer’s market

Most Americans opt to move to a neighboring state when they decide to move across state lines. In only 20 states was the top destination not a bordering state — and for 13 of those states, Florida was the most popular location among out-of-state movers.

Texas had the smallest percentage of residents who wanted to move to another state, at just 6.6%, followed by Michigan (8.6%) and Florida (8.9%). One reason why the Lone Star State might keep its residents happier than their peers who live elsewhere could be the growing job markets in cities like Houston, Dallas and Austin.

California has seen a mass exodus of residents in recent years, according to Trulia, many of whom were searching (potentially in vain) for more affordable housing. Despite that, the Golden State doesn’t have the largest share of out-of-state movers.

That honor instead goes to Alaska, where nearly one in four people buying a new home were looking to move to another state. Other states with a large share of out-of-state movers include Hawaii, North Dakota, New York and Rhode Island.","For Americans looking for a better life, this state is their No. 1 choice"

Get a large inheritance from your grandparents. ,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/24/i-saved-100k-on-30k-salary-here-are-my-money-saving-tips.html,"Between 2004 and 2012, I lived in New York City, made around $30,000 a year, and saved over $100,000. It was enough money that, when the time came, I could hand over the piggy bank as a down payment on my first apartment. I was able to save so much while making so little because I did my best to minimize bad choices, like trying to keep up with the New York Joneses, and maximize good fortune, like an inheritance from my grandmother. Both mattered a great deal. So did seemingly incidental things, like settling down with someone thrifty. Here are the five most important savings tips I learned in those eight years. If you're going to partner up, do it wisely ﻿Love advice seems like a strange start to a story about saving, I know. And yet, nothing will deplete you faster, emotionally and materially, than getting stuck with the wrong person, or dating when you actually want to be single. Besides, love and money are usually entangled from the start, one way or another. Ben, who I met in college, was a big-hearted, thoughtful guy who was right for me, and I sensed from the start that part of what made us compatible was that we both prioritized the same things, like security. That meant we didn't take impulsive trips to Vegas, or even to Florida; we kept impulse buys of all sorts to a minimum. He didn't ask for expensive gifts from me, and I never expected jewelry or flowers. We found affordable ways to say ""I love you."" He once found me a perfect book of poetry at The Strand that probably cost $5 but meant more than 15 bouquets.

Try not to kiss frogs. Kissing frogs is expensive.

Once we moved to New York, we split a bedroom in someone else's apartment, cooked in bulk, and shopped at food coops, secondhand stores and other places we knew we could get good deals. Sometimes we took frugality too far: My mom was grossed out by our dresser, which had been abandoned in a field off the New Jersey Turnpike, and flat-out repulsed by the broken futon we slept on as a bed, which we had found on Second Avenue. But for the most part, we managed to keep things simple without feeling deprived (and, thank God, without getting bedbugs). We took romantic walks together and treated ourselves to at least one dinner out a week. On special occasions, we threw caution to the wind and got tickets to Broadway shows like ""Avenue Q"" or reservations at bucket-list restaurants like Babbo. Surround yourself with like-minded people The fact that Ben had little interest in clubbing or brunches meant I was able to save, even when I worked a series of frustrating entry-level jobs that paid me under $30,000 a year. But the fact that my friends felt the same way helped too. We didn't shop for fun; instead, we hung out at each other's apartments, in parks, in free museums, in art galleries and at coffee shops. We played board games and watched DVDs.

Fancy fun at home

We skipped the traditional Manhattan nightlife stuff — fancy cocktails and overpriced beer, as well as the associated late-night splurges on diner food and taxis — in favor of cheap evening events like readings, improv shows and The Moth story slams. Often, we could call it a night having spent under 10 bucks each. I still felt like I was experiencing New York City and having a social life, but I wasn't going broke. Put your money to work I opened a savings account immediately upon starting my first job out of college and, though I changed positions several times in those first few years and never earned much, my mentality stayed the same: Money was mainly for future use, not present pleasure. Once I had enough for about six months of living expenses, I opened up a high-yield online savings account that gave me four percent interest and started moving reserves over there. And once that amount had grown substantially, I took a good chunk and moved it into a high-yield, multi-year CD.

Locking my money away, even though it meant I'd get it back and then some in the long run, made me nervous: What if I needed funds and couldn't get them? What if I had an emergency that exceeded the capabilities of my six-month cushion? I decided to risk it. I was lucky: Even when I did get unexpected doctor bills, and when I was let go and had to live off of $400 a week in unemployment checks, my six-month fund supported me, just as it was designed to do. And, as the CDs matured, I rolled principal and profits into more CDs. Though I didn't know it, I was doing a kind of CD laddering, and it worked. Avoid lifestyle inflation

For our first few years in the city, Ben was a student and I was an entry-level worker, and we arranged ourselves accordingly: doing a lot of cooking and not a lot of partying or traveling, squished into small spaces, most notably a studio so tiny you could almost touch the bed from the kitchen table. We lived in that 250-square-foot room for nearly three years.

Gradually, our prospects improved. I got jobs that paid better and put me on an actual career trajectory, and he graduated from law school and started working at a firm. Even then, though, we kept our low-key habits. That was in part so that Ben could throw everything possible at his student loans. We spent under or about $2,000 a month on rent, total. We cooked in bulk every Sunday and brought lunch to work. We walked or took trains rather than hailing cabs. We were more generous with our friends and families and when giving to charities, and that was satisfying. We bought slightly nicer clothes. Generally, though, our mentality remained the same: We treated his debt not like it was a mosquito bite, a small irritant, but like a plague of mosquitoes, something that had to be vanquished as soon as possible at all costs. Put windfalls to work, too I was helped virtually every step of the way by good luck: At least until 2008, the economy was strong and interest rates were high; I had found a partner who felt the same way I did about saving for the future and with whom I could split costs; and, though I dealt with setbacks like layoffs, bad bosses and worse landlords, I wasn't rocked by any real tragedies.

Should You Make a Career Change at 50? Tips on How to Do It Successfully

By Indeed Editorial Team January 18, 2022 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email Copy to Clipboard

A career change at 50 years old can increase your peace of mind, passion and activity levels. If your current career doesn't satisfy you, changing fields can provide new challenges and relationships that will boost your work satisfaction. It's important, however, to know how to make that switch to ensure you get the desired results in your new occupation. In this article, we discuss how to change careers at 50, the advantages of doing so and how to overcome disadvantages.

Tips for making a career change at 50

Regardless of your reasons for swapping careers after 50, these tips can make the transition easier:

Think about more than money

When making a career change at 50, money may not be the most important factor in your choice of occupation. Equally or even more important are your health, personal satisfaction, impact on society and self-actualization.

Avoid fear

Changing careers at a later age can bring unintended consequences, but it is important not to allow fear and negative emotions to discourage you from achieving your career goals. You may need the support of your family and friends, but do your best to persevere through the fear.

Be realistic

It is crucial to have realistic expectations when setting career goals to ensure you derive optimal satisfaction from your new job.

Update your skills

If you want to change careers, consider updating your skills and credentials now so it will be easier to transition later.

Be open to working with younger people

You may be in charge at your old job, but changing careers at 50 may require working with younger people. Some of your younger colleagues may hold senior positions and have divergent views. To succeed in the new role, try to accept feedback from your team members to better learn your new field.

How to make a career change at 50

Changing careers at 50 requires several definitive steps:

Perform a self-assessment. Determine the career you want to pursue. Identify the requirements of the new career. Rebrand your professional image. Create a career plan. Create powerful resumes. Be patient and positive.

1. Perform a self-assessment

The first step is to assess yourself and what you want in your next career. Find out what makes work interesting to you. A career counselor can guide you toward making the right career decision. Factors to consider include your age, health, retirement plans, skills and qualifications. At the end of the self-assessment, create a list of potential occupations and careers for further research.

Related: How to Change Careers

2. Determine the career you want to pursue

After making a list of careers, narrow it down to one or two options. Before you select an occupation, research each of the positions to identify the one that best suits your interests, experience and skills. Some factors to consider include the career prospects of each job, the projected growth of the industry and the effect of technology on jobs in the coming years.

Another factor to consider is the earning potential. While money may not be your primary motivator for changing careers, you may still need the new occupation to pay bills and save for retirement.

It's best to pick a career that allows you to transfer skills from your previous job. That way, you won't need to spend extensive time and money on training and certification. Job satisfaction surveys can also help you determine whether the occupation is a good fit for you.

Here are more tips for helping to determine what you want to do:

Look for similarities

Many industries have functions that overlap. If you can't find a career that suits your skills and interests, look for similarities between the responsibilities of your former and new careers. Different fields often use the same management practices, although there might be slight differences.

Things like project management, organization, computer skills, interpersonal relations and integrity cut across diverse fields. If you can find common grounds, it becomes easier to select a new career where you can thrive and achieve your goals.

Take your time

Avoid rushing into choosing a different career because you are unsatisfied with your current position. It is better to take your time to research all your options and weigh the pros and cons of each career compared to your present job.

Be flexible

You may need to make concessions to achieve your aims when making a career change at 50. If you want to change careers to have more time for family and recreational activities, an ideal job may offer less pay but more free time. You may also need to move to another town or state, take up more responsibilities and even go back to school. A new career may require sacrifices, and this requires some flexibility from you.

Being flexible also means not restricting yourself to a specific work. The most viable occupation that matches your skills and experience may offer only part-time or contract employment. You can start with that to gain a foothold in the industry. After some time, you will build a network and have access to more opportunities.

Leverage your network

At 50, you may have already built an extensive network of colleagues, friends, relatives and acquaintances over the years. Informing these people about your plans to change careers could provide several opportunities.

3. Identify the requirements of the new career

Once you've chosen a career, determine what you need to enter the profession. Research the educational qualifications, certifications, licenses and other regulatory requirements of the occupation. You can check recent job ads for the specific skills and credentials employers in the industry want to see in candidates.

Another way to research a career is to shadow professionals in the industry and ask them for details about getting into the industry. The information you get from this research can give you an idea of the time and cost of entering a new career.

4. Rebrand your professional image

Once you've decided on a new career, it is important to rebrand your professional image to meet the expectations of the new field. Learn the industry language and practices, and rewrite your online profiles to make them more relevant.

This is the time to become active in the preferred social media space of your new career. Contributing to discussions and networking on social media can give your career prospects a powerful boost. Meet new people and let them know of your availability.

5. Create a career plan

Once you've positioned yourself as a professional looking to make a career switch, outline a plan. It is advisable to create short- and long-term goals you want to achieve considering your age, health and other factors that can impact your ability to continue working.

A good way to go about this is to have a file to organize potential employers, job ads, resumes, interview dates, networking events and other activities. This will make your job search efforts orderly and allow you to track your progress.

6. Create powerful resumes

You need a professional resume to promote yourself as the best candidate for jobs. This means having impeccable writing in your resume and knowing the correct format recruiters expect. Writing resumes requires tailoring each document to the specific requirements of each position.

It is vital to research each job ad and the employer before writing your resume to identify their core competencies and requirements. This will allow you to craft resumes that highlight your most relevant skills and show you as the best fit for the role.

7. Be patient and positive

When you apply for jobs, remain positive if it takes time to get a position. During this period, surround yourself with positive energy and engage in activities that move you closer to your goals. This can help ensure that you can deliver your responsibilities when you eventually get the position.

Advantages of making a career change at 50

Here are some benefits of changing careers at 50:

Self-actualization

Switching careers at 50 can provide an opportunity to attain the highest level of professional achievement for many people. Many older people have gathered immense experience and expertise over the years, and changing careers allows them to choose an occupation or position where they can use their skills to deliver the best results and enjoy higher job satisfaction.

Reduce stress

Another benefit of changing careers is reduced stress. Despite the perks attached to senior positions, many older professionals can't continue to work at the highest level because of stress and other demands on their lives. Leaving such a position for a low-stress environment can offer more value than a lucrative salary for some.

New learning opportunities

New careers offer people the opportunity to learn new things. It might be working with high-tech equipment, learning to code, using data to make decisions or collaborating with the younger generation. The prospects of learning something new can add more excitement to work, increase job satisfaction and help you create new relationships.

Passion

A new career can help you pursue your passion. At the beginning of their careers, many people don't know what drives them. As people get older, they have more clarity about their purpose, desires and activities that will give their lives meaning. For many people, going into another industry is the best route to making a career out of their passion.

How to overcome disadvantages when making a career change at 50

Here are things you can do to overcome the challenges of switching careers as a 50-year-old professional:

1. Keep learning

To make sure you are a viable job candidate, stay current on new information in the field. Read books, attend industry events, take online courses and stay open to new knowledge. Learn digital skills and be adaptable to the use of new technology at work.

2. Cultivate friendships across generations

If you intend to switch careers, build long-lasting friendships that cut across generations. Older people may have more authority in the industry, but younger generations allow you to use leadership and mentorship skills and help you stay on top of new developments.

3. Update your resumes

Keep your resumes up-to-date to improve the chances of getting hired. Optimize your resumes with the correct format acceptable to recruiters and make them compliant with applicant tracking systems. Keep your age and other private information confidential.

4. Focus on the positives

In discussions with recruiters and hiring managers, consider your age as an advantage. If the subject comes up, use it to boost your credentials in terms of the experience, achievements and qualifications you have earned over the years.",Should You Make a Career Change at 50?

For parents Phillip and Kylie, their biggest wish after giving birth to their daughter was to conceive twins.

But when Kylie fell pregnant and the couple got to see the ultrasound for the first time, they were in for a big suprise.

Phillip and Kylie had spent many years trying to expand their family. Two years ago they finally welcomed their daughter, River, who they loved more than anything else in the world.

Butt there was one more dream they wanted to fulfill.

Phillip and Kylie had several relatives who had conceived twins.

One day Kylie took a pregnancy test and sure enough, she was pregnant.

But it wouldn’t be twins.

When they visited the doctor some months later to see the ultrasound, they were in for a shock. There wasn’t just one or two babies in Kylie’s belly.

The couple were expecting four new bundles of joy, something that only happens one in every 700 000 pregnancies.

“I laughed… I just, I was laughing, I couldn’t help it,” Kylie tells local news station Fox10.

Although the couple have been a little anxious over heir new arrivals, all four babies, who they plan to name Amelia, Damien, Gideon and Theo, are all developing well.

"$1,500,000",https://news.speedsociety.com/bmw-tupac-shakur-was-shot-in-is-up-for-sale-staggering-price/,"In western culture, some of the ideas that we come up with are pretty crazy. ...

In western culture, some of the ideas that we come up with are pretty crazy. Sometimes, what’s perceived to be worth a lot of money can be wild to consider. Our fascination with celebrity culture dictates that some odd possessions bring big money. Furthermore, objects linked to a celebrity’s death can fetch incredibly high dollar price tags.

You see, the infatuation that we have with celebrities means that pretty much everything that they have ever touched becomes worth money somehow. If someone can figure out a way to get them to slap their signature on something, it could be worth even more!

After seeing one of Marilyn Monroe’s dresses go for over a million dollars at auction, you never really know what could happen. At some point in time, this all becomes rather obsessive. It’s really interesting to take a look at to see just how far people will go to collect pop culture.

So, we know celebrity possessions are worth more than an average possession. So, if Tupac Shakur is one of the godfathers of rap, would it follow that his possessions are worth a lot more? He is one of the most well known to ever do it.

Would the car that he was fatally shot in in 1996 be worth an absurd amount of money? Depending on who we ask, that answer could vary in intensity. I think that, across the board, pretty much all collectors would agree on one thing. Something like this could put together quite the asking price.

For those who know very much of anything about Tupac’s life, they probably know of that fateful night where a bullet would enter the BMW 7-Series that he was traveling in. The projectile would hit Shakur. This sent him to the hospital where he would be pronounced dead.

Nobody knew it at the time but this would eventually make the car a very important pop-culture item. Just keep in mind that the old Bimmer is worth more than the majority of American houses. With no link to Shakur, we’d be shocked to see it fetch five figures.

Just to put things in perspective, for a vehicle like this that has no historical significance, the Kelly Blue Book value tells us that a price of, say, $5000 dollars would probably be pretty generous. In fact, it may be even overpaying by about double the value in some areas. However, when one pins one of music’s biggest icon’s deaths to it, that $5000 multiplies rather quickly.

Experts agree that historical significance could be worth up to $1 million. The organization that’s in possession of the car, Celebrity Cars Las Vegas, thinks that they can get more! The listing price is $1.5 million for the machine that is now in their possession.

If you follow along down in the video below, you’ll be able to get an up close and personal look at the car. Pawn Stars shows us exactly what over $1 million in the form of an automobile looks like.

After seeing something like this, we’re really led to wonder exactly why they would’ve repaired this car at all. As a collector’s item, we would think that somebody would really value the exact status of the car as it was left that night, bullet holes in the side and the damage done to the windshield along with all of the other signs that greatness once resided within.

In the form of a smoothie. ,https://www.etonline.com/hilary-duff-reveals-how-she-ate-her-placenta-after-welcoming-daughter-113350,"Hilary Duff is handling being a mother of two like a pro.

The Younger star, who welcomed daughter Banks last month, opened up about her ""delightful"" placenta that she had in smoothie form after giving birth.

During an interview with the Dr. Berlin Informed Pregnancy podcast posted on Thursday, Duff, 31, shared that it was the ""most delightful smoothie I've ever had.""

""I haven’t had a smoothie that delightful since I was, like, 10 years old. It was calorie-filled with juice and fruit and everything delicious,"" she explained. ""It was good. I was a little wigged out at first, to be honest."" Duff said she continues to consume her placenta, but not in capsule form like many new mothers, but in ice cube form.

""I've heard placenta burps are not ideal,"" she replied when Dr. Berlin asked why she didn't opt for capsules.

As for the feeling she had after giving birth, Duff was overwhelmed with joy upon being handed her little one.

""They hand her to me and I'm looking at her.. and she reaches up both of her arms and curls into me,"" she recalled. ""It was the most, I couldn't believe how strong she was, but it was so clearly, like, a hug. It was amazing. It makes me want to cry. It made me feel like she was, 'Good team, Mom.'""

Duff and boyfriend Matthew Koma welcomed their first child together, a baby girl, on Oct. 25. The former Disney Channel star took to Instagram a couple of days later to share the exciting news.

""Banks Violet Bair❤️ this little bit has fully stolen our hearts! She joined our world at home on Thursday afternoon and is absolute magic ✨,"" she wrote alongside a photo of the three of them. She is also mother to 6-year-old son Luca from her previous marriage.

On Wednesday, Duff posted a sweet, sleepy photo of her bundle of joy. ""Not a care in the world ?,"" she captioned the shot.

What further compounds this issue, however, is that last year, 57% of U.S. adults said the same thing. And while we're only talking about a one-percentage-point difference, the takeaway here is that Americans on the whole aren't getting smarter about socking away some cash. And if they don't change their ways, they risk wrecking their finances irreparably.

The danger of not having savings

We all know that it's virtually impossible to predict what expenses might come our way. But without some sort of safety net, you'll be putting yourself in a position in which you're forced to rack up debt (and damage your credit score in the process) to cover an unanticipated bill.

So how much money should you have on hand for emergencies? Sadly, $1,000 won't cut it. Generally speaking, it's a good idea to have three to six months' worth of living expenses tucked away in the bank. If you happen to only spend $333 a month, then sure, go ahead and say that $1,000 is your optimal savings target. The reality, however, is that $1,000 is probably only a fraction of what you spend in a single month. And the fact that more than half of Americans don't even have that much means that collectively, we're looking at a serious savings crisis.

Padding that bank account

If your savings level isn't where it should be, you'll need to do better. And there are several avenues you can take to get there.

First, create a budget if you don't have one already, see what you're currently spending money on, and find ways to cut back. You might choose to lower one major expense, like your rent or car payment, or make a few smaller changes, like canceling your gym membership, packing lunch for work instead of buying it, and trimming your cable plan.

Next, look at getting a side hustle. These days, a good 44 million Americans do additional work on top of their regular jobs, and while doing so will clearly eat into your downtime, it's also a good way to put extra cash in your pocket. In fact, it's estimated that 36% of workers with a side hustle bring home an extra $500 or more per month as a result. And that's certainly a worthwhile payoff.

Finally, don't hesitate to fight for a raise at work if you feel you're underpaid. If you do some research and find that you're earning less than the average person in your area with your job title, you can present that data to your boss and make the case for a boost. This especially holds true if you're a strong performer who's consistently gotten great performance reviews and solid feedback.

Amassing an emergency fund with three to six months of living expenses is something that most certainly takes time. Saving up $1,000, on the other hand, is a different story. In fact, if you're able to work a side hustle and really cut back on extras in your budget, there's a good chance you'll hit that target in a month or two. Of course, you don't want to stop at that $1,000 -- but getting there sooner rather than later is a good goal to strive for.","You Won’t Believe How Many Americans Have Less Than $1,000 in Savings"
46%,https://www.aol.com/news/poll-two-thirds-republicans-still-165934571.html,"A majority of Republicans still believe the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump, according to a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll. The latest findings show how persistent this false narrative continues to be, despite the preponderance of evidence against it.

The survey of 1,552 U.S. adults, which was conducted from July 30 to Aug. 2, found that 66 percent of Republicans continue to insist that “the election was rigged and stolen from Trump,” while just 18 percent believe “Joe Biden won fair and square.” Twenty-eight percent of independent voters also said they think Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 election, as did a small 3 percent of Democrats.

While those who continue to hold this unsubstantiated view about the election are in the overall minority, representing just 29 percent of total respondents, the number has remained relatively unchanged over the last several months. Since January, similar surveys have found that between 27 and 29 percent of people believe the election was rigged.

Trump has continually repeated this falsehood since the November election, offering a mixture of debunked conspiracy theories to allege widespread fraud.

The then president’s false claims fueled a violent mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying Biden’s win in the Electoral College.

The latest Yahoo News/YouGov poll was conducted in the week following the first public hearing of the House select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack, which featured firsthand testimony from police officers who responded to the riot at the Capitol. The results indicate that the hearing did little to change the public’s perception of that event.

Since May, surveys have found that a majority of people — between 65 and 71 percent — believe the attack was not justified, and the latest poll falls within that range, at 69 percent. Blame for the Jan. 6 riot remained essentially unchanged from previous surveys, with 48 percent pointing the finger at Trump supporters who gathered at the Capitol, and the vast majority of that 48 percent blaming Trump himself.

A closer look at the respondents’ party affiliations shows a clear divide within these views: 81 percent of Democrats said Trump was responsible for the Jan. 6 attack, compared with just 9 percent of Republicans and 43 percent of independents. Only 15 percent of Republicans blamed Trump supporters who gathered at the Capitol for the violence that took place on Jan. 6, while 48 percent of Republicans said that “left wing protesters trying to make Trump look bad” were largely at fault. Conspiracy theories have falsely blamed liberal agitators like antifa for the attack.

Attitudes about the select committee’s probe and the first public hearing were similarly split along partisan lines. Overall, 51 percent of respondents supported more investigations into Jan. 6, with 83 percent of Biden supporters saying “we still need to find out the truth of what happened” on that day, while 62 percent of Trump supporters (31 percent of the total) said they think “there have been enough investigations already.” The same percentage of respondents (51 percent) agreed with the Capitol Police officers who described those who stormed the Capitol as “terrorists,” with 90 percent of Biden supporters agreeing with this characterization and 74 percent of Trump supporters (31 percent of the total) saying they disagree.

Try a bad tipper who dangles a few measly dollars in front of servers as an incentive for good service.

At least, that's what the internet has collectively agreed.

On Thursday, Mark Arum, a newscaster for WSB-TV tweeted about a now-viral Facebook post from someone who allegedly boasted about their success using a certain tipping hack.

As a former waiter, please don't ever do this. Ever. pic.twitter.com/X2i8MtrUb1 — Mark Arum (@MarkArum) August 2, 2018

""As a former waiter, please don't ever do this. Ever,"" Arum wrote. His recent post has already been retweeted over 500 times and has thousands of comments.

The hack, which resurfaced from major social media uproar back in 2016, involves putting a total of $5 (regardless of how much the bill may be) in singles out on the table upon being seated at a restaurant. Diners are then advised to remove a dollar each time the server makes a mistake — without saying anything. At the end of the meal, what's left is the tip.

""You will receive the best service of your life,"" the unnamed poster wrote. ""The waitress kept looking at it as if she was confused. But she played her cards right, did a great job and received the whole 5 bucks.""

The tweet has continued to stir up a slew of emotional comments (many from people who claim to have worked in the service industry). One person even noted that the way someone treats ""a waiter"" shows his or her true colors.

It reminds one of that thing about ""all you need to know about someone is how they treat a waiter."" What a jerk ... — Greg Screws (@gregscrews) August 3, 2018

Many reactions demonstrated personal offense.

That’s pretty disgusting behaviour to be honest, who are to display such crass behaviour. If you want to leave a tip then do so, or don’t.... but to flaunt your cash in this way is just awful. You are taken advantage of poorly paid employees. — Sandra 󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 (@SandraRankin_UK) August 3, 2018

Toxic fumes and it's a fire hazard. ,https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/cooking-turkey-in-a-bag-can-be-toxic/,"When cooking turkey in a bag, think plastic. Paper grocery bags can be toxic. Here's why.

It was during the 1950s that the idea of cooking a turkey in a paper grocery bag first became trendy, and the notion still occasionally makes a comeback every few years. But there are three words of caution anyone tempted to try cooking turkey in a bag needs to hear: Don’t do it.

In the endless quest for the life-changing bird that will make the chef a legend at future holiday dinners, many different cooking methods have been born—from grilling in the backyard to prepping it in the dishwasher (another don’t).

Science says no

According to experts, the brown-bag method ranks right up (down?) there with the dishwasher. Both the University of Illinois and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) agree—using a grocery bag is dangerous

Still, believers say cooking turkey in a bag guarantees a heavenly bird—juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside, with crispy golden skin. Plus clean up woes get tossed with the bag.

Why you shouldn’t roast in a bag

But the reality, according to the USDA, is that there can be toxic fumes from the ink, glue and recycled materials in the bag. Plus, you can start a fire in your oven. Bad for the oven and bad for the turkey.

One “compromise”—and our friends at U of I will back us up here—is to toss the paper and try a turkey-size oven cooking bag, instead. While popping plastic in the oven may seem like an even worse idea than paper, oven bags are made of materials that are heatproof past the average temperatures used in ovens. Most oven bags you’ll find in the store are FDA approved (but always check) and they don’t contain BPA or other dangerous chemicals.

A better bag

Brined birds—such as a fresh herb brined turkey or a marinated Thanksgiving turkey are often double bagged to contain the tasty liquid. The equally delicious lemon herb roasted turkey cooks up the magic in a single oven bag, however. Paper is not recommended for any of these recipes.

Learn exactly how to use one of these special oven bags here.

Not just for the birds

The idea of cooking with paper still has merit, though—as long as it’s the right kind. Orange tilapia retains its moisture because it is cooked in a parchment paper pouch. And simple but elegant citrus salmon en papillote gets its flavor (and its fancy name) from the parchment-paper cooking method.

"Cut back on expenses, downgrade your home, and have a $110,000 salary. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/style/fire-financial-independence-retire-early.html,"Perhaps Mr. Long, the pharmacist in rural Tennessee, has given the most detailed, thoughtful account of someone who has fired. In a series of posts to Reddit’s financial independence message board, Mr. Long chronicled with dry wit and self-effacement his first year in retirement.

One month into FIRE, he wrote of the guilt he felt spending money (on video games), and his concern that he would be over his household budget. He spent his days with family, at the gym, doing housework, exercising. He had no regrets so far: “I made the right decision. This is life.”

In the second month, Mr. Long reported a 2.8 percent increase to his portfolio over the first two months, even after living expenses, and listed his accomplishments as more reading, more cooking, volunteering and “faster Rubik’s cube solves.” Stress levels were way down, he wrote: “A friend of mine said the sense of dread from my face was gone.”

In the months that followed, he rewatched the mini-series “Roots,” lost all interest in talk of FIRE now that he had achieved it, feared a looming stock market crash, had nightmares that “I’m back at work and arguing with morons,” finished a marathon in a personal best sub-three hours, felt moments of social isolation, took a two-week road trip across the heartland, and went twice to the beach in Florida with his wife and watched their net worth reach its highest point, despite not working, which he attributed to “the passage of the tax cut for wealthy job creators like myself.”

Oh, and he started a blog.

The Teen Mom 2 alum told fans in March 2021 that she was diagnosed with a spinal cord cyst.

Today, the mom of three took to her Instagram Stories for a chat about her FeNO score - a method of diagnosis for asthma, which followed her recent fibromyalgia revelation.

One fan wrote: ""You know that ALS is often misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia at first,"" to which she replied: ""Yeah ... I'm hoping that's not what I have.

""Still testing for other stuff.

""And now I have to go get a breathing test done,"" followed by an Emoji face icon with rolling eyes.

ALS, which stands for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is a progressive nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control.

Fans suggested her symptoms were similar to a condition, myasthenia gravis, to which the star promised she would ""mention it to my doc.""

Meanwhile another of the Teen Mom 2's followers told how they had spotted the reality star at a diner, but did not approach.

Commenting in the midst of her health battles, Jenelle added: ""Thanks.

""Lol my anxiety has been super bad today.""

FIBROMYALGIA DIAGNOSIS

The star recently revealed she’d been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in an interview with E! News.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fibromyalgia is a condition that causes pain all over the body, sleeping problems, and fatigue.

An individual with fibromyalgia is more susceptible to pain, and the condition can cause sufferers emotional and mental distress.

Talking to E!, she explained: ""I never knew what fibromyalgia was until my doctor diagnosed me.""

TIKTOK CONFESSION

Jenelle shared the news of her spinal cord cyst in a TikTok video, when responding to a fan.

The controversial star was asked: ""Hey sweetheart are you feeling better with your hemangiomas & cysts? Were you able to get help? Praying for you!""

Sitting with a hand on her cheek and a worried look on her face, she responded.

""So, yeah, about that. Let me tell you guys a little health update and sorry you're going through the same thing.

""I got a second opinion from a different neurologist and she's going to be checking me for ALS.

""Since she has told me this, yes, I've been freaking out in my head a lot. I've been crying a lot.

""I've been crying, like, every single night by myself.

""But we're redoing all my bloodwork, we're redoing my nerve study. I have to go get another nerve study done next week because that checks for more diseases.""

She went on: ""She referred me to a neurosurgeon about the cyst in my head and the cyst in my spine so we're going to check that out in March.

""She's also having me go to a lung doctor because I have a hard time breathing and catching my breath and I'm not sick.

""Since I have cysts popping up everywhere, my doctor wants to check my lungs to see if there's cyst there too. My hands are really shaky and my thumb grip is almost completely gone on my left hand.""

Jenelle concluded: ""Hopefully I'll get answers soon.""

Fans flocked to the comments with some wishing the North Carolina native well, some suggesting other potential diagnosis', and others slamming the ex MTV star.

FAN FEEDBACK

One commenter wrote: ""Please have them check you for Lyme Disease!! It can often be misdiagnosed with ALS and it’s completely treatable!! Sending Prayers for you!!""

Jenelle responded: ""Thanks for the support and prayers.""

Another wrote: ""Have you been tested for MS?""

The ex TV star again replied, saying: ""Yes I have been tested and I don’t have that either.""

A third fan asked: ""Yikes! Why do they suspect ALS? Thats scary! Praying for you!""

Jenelle revealed: ""My stomach feels like I’ve been doing ab crunches while sitting.""

Another chimed in: ""I pray more than anything in the world you do not have ALS, my dad passed from that in 2014, I wouldn’t wish it upon my worse enemy.""

Jenelle responded: ""Me too! I hope I get good answers. I would have to prepare a lot in my life and it’s heartbreaking to think about. I’m sorry about your dad.""

On Reddit, however, fans were far less kind as one user posted Jenelle's video, writing: ""You do not have ALS.""

Another wrote: ""Can someone please make a power point presentation of all the illnesses and symptoms she’s claimed over the years

""This is important work.""

Someone else added: ""Lord, the hypochondria.""

HEALTH WOES

In 2021, Jenelle made a shocking revelation to fans.

The mom of three said she was ""in shock"" after her doctors diagnosed her with a ""rare"" spinal disorder called syringomyelia.

Syringomyelia is the development of a cyst (called a syrinx) within the spinal cord, which causes pain and weakness and, in some, cases can lead to paralysis.

Symptoms include headaches, neck pain, arm and back pain, loss of reflexes, and muscle weakness and wasting.

She elaborated on her condition in a YouTube vlog called ""My Neck, My Back.""

Jenelle said she had been battling daily headaches and dealing with her neck ""cracking 10 times a day.""

She alum said she had been having tests done for months and not getting any answers, which she described as ""really frustrating.""

Jenelle - who is married to David Eason - had an MRI, which revealed a cyst in her spine.

""It's pretty concerning. That's not good. None of this is good,"" she said at the time, fighting back tears.

Now, we have the facts to back it up - new research from the Psychological Bulletin reveals that our self-esteem peaks when we are 60-years-old.



This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

The paper researched more than 300 studies on self-esteem in different age groups, which identified a pattern across birth year, gender and nationality.

Self-esteem increased consistently until the highest point at 60, where it stayed for the next decade, then declined slightly when the person reached their 70s and 80s, until finally dropping more sharply at age 90, reports The Cut.

The study also found that the relationship we have with ourselves improves steadily over the first few decades of our lives. Self-esteem can be defined as “a person’s subjective evaluation of his or her worth as a person.” The peak age at 60 could be down to feeling more confident in who you are, not caring what other people think or being at peace with your body, perhaps due to increased life experience.

On the flip side, the pressures of social media could explain the lower levels of self-esteem the younger we are, as a study last year found Instagram to be the worst social network in terms of its impact on mental health.

Depreciation. ,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/21/car-depreciation-is-a-budget-killer-heres-how-to-avoid-it.html,"Considering insurance, gas, maintenance and repairs, most drivers are well aware of how expensive cars are to buy and maintain. In fact, the average cost to own and operate a new vehicle is $9,282 a year, according to an annual study by AAA. However, the largest expense that comes with buying a new car largely falls under the radar, the automotive group said.

How much does a new car depreciate?

Of all costs, depreciation, a measure of how quickly a car loses value, remains the single biggest cost of ownership, accounting for more than a third, or 36%, of the average annual cost, according to AAA. New cars typically depreciate the minute you drive off the lot. By the time it's a year old, the vehicle has lost nearly one-third of its value, according to Edmunds data. The secret to minimizing depreciation costs: ""Keep your car for a long time and keep it well-maintained or even consider buying a quality, pre-owned vehicle,"" said Robert Sinclair, a spokesman for AAA Northeast.

It's just a plane flying over the ocean. ,https://www.iflscience.com/technology/dont-believe-the-latest-rumor-about-missing-flight-mh370/,"A selection of tabloids are reporting on the exploits of someone who reckons they know where missing passenger jet MH370 has ended up. Here’s the thing: When a sole individual claims to have cracked a case that has left countless authorities and experts all over the world utterly stumped, they probably haven’t cracked the case.

The person, in this case, is a video producer from the UK. He thinks he’s seen the outline of the missing jet on Google Maps. He reckons that the plane landed in Cambodia within a mountainous area west of Phnom Penh, and he’s heading there himself to check on foot.

So, a few things here. Outlines of objects aren’t what they seem, particularly when viewed from satellite imagery. Conspiracy theorists often see outlines of plenty of complex things on Mars and under Earth’s oceans, but they are literally never what they appear to be. Far from being advanced structures built by aliens, they are instead just piles of rocks partly covered in shadows.

-

The outline in question, which you can see in the images here courtesy of Google Earth, might look like a plane, sure. It’s impossible, however, that such a plane could land on the treetops of the wilderness of Cambodia and just sit there completely intact. Make no mistake: It would have crashed and fragmented into thousands of pieces.

There's also, of course, the chance that the image is fake. It wouldn't be difficult to add in a pixelated plane to an already blurry satellite image in order to drum up attention. At the same time, people have claimed to have spotted MH370 from Google Maps/Earth before. Guess what? They were mistaken.

-

The outline could perhaps be of a real plane of some sort, but one that was snapped by satellite imaging equipment as it flew over Cambodia.

Kindness. ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2018/09/10/when-applying-to-college-this-character-trait-may-mean-more-than-grades/,"Students tend to start with obvious — and sometimes trite — topics: successes and failures, times of struggle, or mistakes that produced valuable lessons. However, the best essays are born when students dig deeper and share something that makes them tear up, or causes their eyes to twinkle or their tones to shift.

The only genuine way for students to recognize these personal moments of authenticity is for them to hear it for themselves. They need auditory feedback to recognize a pause, a moment of vulnerability, or a shift in their tone when they talk about the topic that should be the focus of their college essays. The insider secret? They should record themselves speaking about something that they love, that’s disappointing or that gets them fired up about life. They’ll hear it when it happens.

After guiding hundreds of these recorded chats with students over the past 20 years, I have noticed a common theme among those whose college essays brought about the best results in admissions to their top-choice colleges. The students who talk about moments of genuine kindness reveal more authenticity than those who focus on other subjects.

One student who was passionate about science and engineering lit up while talking about volunteering at a local science museum, planning creative projects for kids and narrating the planetarium show.

Another student talked about how his family’s deep concern for and commitment to the well-being of abused and neglected animals helped teach him to be more compassionate toward people.

One compared the experience of caring for her sick mother while going to school to trying to keep a full glass of water from spilling during an obstacle course. It’s impossible, of course. Water spills.

And one who lived in a home that couldn’t always afford to put dinner on the table spent every Sunday at his local church feeding the homeless. He knew how it felt to be hungry.

These students discovered something about themselves when they identified the situations in which they were the most kind. Kindness builds character, and colleges (and employers) care about character. Yes, grades, course rigor and test scores matter. But consider that most student applications will look very similar with just a straight numbers comparison. Kindness allows students to stand out.

Story continues below advertisement

A recent report by the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Making Caring Common, speaks to this. Colleges want students who care. They are drawn to applicants who show concern for others, promote good citizenship and civic engagement and develop personal responsibility. Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale University, says they “want students who have achieved in and out of the classroom, but [they] are also looking for things harder to quantify, [like] authentic intellectual engagement and a concern for others and the common good.”

Let’s take a step back for a second and think about why colleges care about students being kind. They care because society cares. Quite simply, we need more kindness in our homes, in our schools and in our communities. The impact of enduring kindness supersedes the name of the school on a college sweatshirt. Being yourself and channeling your inner kindness to build character should be the focus. Getting into your top-choice college should be the bonus of being kind, not the reason to be kind.

So channel your inner kindness. Consider the situations when you’re the kindest, and the people to whom you’re naturally kind. Why would that be? What does it say about you if you feel the most fulfilled when you are being kind to children or to strangers or to your teachers or to horses or to an elderly woman crossing the street? Think about that. It will tell you something about yourself, reveal a brilliant story to share, and give you a reason to be proud of who you are.

Making your bed or not. ,https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/morning-habit-reveals-more-personality-160110058.html,"A new study suggests this daily habit predicts specific personality traits.

Beauty sleep is essential, that much is for sure. But it turns out that what you do first thing after rising from a good night’s rest reveals key traits about your personality. In a new study commissioned by the slumber experts at Sleepopolis, it was found that people who make their beds in the morning differ greatly than those who don’t, in ways that include the amount of sex they have to the types of television shows they prefer.

According to the study, which surveyed 2,000 Americans and their morning habits, those participants who made their bed reported more sex on a weekly basis (three times per week, to be exact), regular exercise, and the ability to wake up without the help of an alarm. Bed-makers were also more likely to work in health or technology fields, and they identified as being confident, adventurous, sociable, and high-maintenance. And if you enjoy romantic movies, jazz music, and the occasional episode of House Hunters, the study found that yes, there’s a good chance you make your bed before going about your day.

As for the people who prefer a messier sleeping situation? It was reported that those respondents hit snooze on the regular, have sex twice per week, and work in business or finance fields. They also identity as being shy, curious, sarcastic, and moody, and they’re more likely to enjoy rock music and Seinfeld reruns, in addition to comedy movies.

Sleep quality came into play too, with those who make their beds rising about 16 minutes earlier than those who don’t. However, participants across the board averaged only six-and-a-half hours of sleep per night. So whether or not making your bed is at the top of your morning to-do list, it’s safe to say we could all benefit from a few additional hours of shut-eye.

Whatever you decide on it going to be with you for life. Perhaps this is why I personally don’t have any. There’s nothing I want on my body forever.

Of course, it could also be that I had quite a few friends go for those trendy lower back tats and tribal armbands back in the early noughties. Tattoos should never follow trends because now they all just look outdated.

What about tattoos on other places on the body, such as the eyeballs or the inside of the mouth? Is that too far?

Tattoos and bad decisions go hand-in-hand. But do you think this guy went too far with his tattoos?

Then there are the people who just make bad decisions. Have you heard about Ben Affleck’s massive phoenix back tattoo? He tried to lie and say it’s fake for a film role when fans spotted him shirtless on the beach. But when it was spotted again years later, Affleck embarrassingly had to come clean.

However, sometimes it’s not the design but the location of a tattoo that was a bad decision. Case in point, one woman from Leicester in the UK claims that her chest tattoo has made her undatable.",Woman Claims She’s Been Left “Undatable” Because Of Embarrassing Chest Tattoo

Another is hidden under the speaker grill on the front, and another sits on the phone’s bottom edge.

The triple microphone configuration was introduced with the launch of the iPhone 5, back in 2012.

The third microphone is, naturally, there to help the phone pick up all of the sounds around you, no matter how you decide hold it.

It also helps with voice recognition, which is becoming increasingly important with the rise in popularity of virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant.

You can actually test your handset’s microphones if you don’t think they’re performing as well as they should be.

As Apple explains: “To test the primary microphone on the bottom of your iPhone, open Voice Memos and tap the record icon. Then speak into the microphone and tap the play icon to play back the recording. You should be able to hear your voice clearly.

“If your voice sounds faint when you’re using the speakerphone on a phone call, make sure that your iPhone receiver isn’t blocked or covered.

“If audio from video recordings sounds faint, or Siri can’t hear you, make sure that the microphone near the iSight camera—on the top, back corner of your iPhone—and the receiver isn’t blocked or covered.”",Why the iPhone has a mysterious little hole next to its camera

Cigarette butts. ,https://www.iflscience.com/environment/there-is-something-even-worse-than-plastic-straws-when-it-comes-to-ocean-waste/,"The world has enjoyed picking up on plastic straws recently when it comes to ocean waste, despite them accounting for just 0.02 percent of ocean waste. But there are bigger fish to fry.

One of those appears to be cigarette butts, according to a report by NBC News. They reported it was the number one human-caused contaminant in the world’s oceans, and it has managed to avoid regulation so far.

The main issue appears to from cigarette filters, which Thomas Novotny, professor of public health at San Diego State University, told NBC News had “no health benefit”. He added that it “seems like a no-brainer to me that we can’t continue to allow this.”

The filters of the 5.6 trillion cigarettes (two-thirds of which are dumped irresponsibly) made around the world each year are composed of cellulose acetate, which can take more than a decade to decompose. Since 1986 cigarette butts have been the most collected item of ocean beaches, with about 60 million found in 32 years.

Filters were invented in the mid-1900s to alleviate health concerns from cigarettes, but have now become a major problem. A 2011 study by Professor Novotny found that getting smokers to stop flicking the ends of their cigarettes was difficult, with anti-litter campaigns and permanent ashtrays being unsuccessful.

A campaign called the Cigarette Butt Pollution Project is now hoping to change attitudes towards cigarette filters. “Cigarette butt waste has polluted our beaches, parks, and communities long enough – it’s time to take action!” they wrote on their website.

Some steps have already been taken to tackle the problem around the world. In the US, attempts have been made to pass legislation to ban filters, or raising cigarette pack costs to cover clean-up funds.

And earlier this month, we reported on a theme park in France that had trained some of its rooks to pick up litter and cigarette butts, with the goal being to show that “nature itself can teach us to take care of the environment.”

So while the war on plastic straws is undoubtedly good news – demonstrating just how easy it is to make a small change to your daily life – there is still much further to go to clean up our oceans. Cracking down on cigarette butts would be a good step.",There Is Something Even Worse Than Plastic Straws When It Comes To Ocean Waste
"$1,362,000.00",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/if-you-put-1000-dollars-in-amazon-in-1997-heres-how-much-youd-have-now.html,"It's been almost a year since Amazon closed its deal to purchase Whole Foods and the verdict is in for shareholders of the online retail giant. Amazon's stock has more than doubled over the past year, outperforming other publicly traded grocery chains by a wide margin. Since the Amazon-Whole Food deal closed, the S&P 500 index has been up 18 percent.

As impressive as that is, original investors in Amazon fare even better. If you had invested $1,000 during Amazon's IPO in May 1997, your investment would be worth $1,341,000 as of August 31, according to CNBC calculations.

That's better than the so-called FAANG stocks, plus Ebay – which debuted in that same period. Apple's gain, which was the second highest at a nearly 58,000 percent, is notable, but it also had a 17-year head start and its return is still less than half of Amazon's.

Amazon is not only crushing the competition from other grocery stores; it continues to reign supreme in retail as well. Since its IPO in May 1997, Amazon has gained over 134,000 percent, far surpassing other competitors.

It's also worth noting that Amazon began as an online bookstore before it grew and diversified. Barnes & Noble, another book retailer, has seen the value of its stock go down nearly by half.

Despite Amazon's remarkable stock performance, any individual stock can over- or under-perform and past returns do not predict future results.

Want to invest in the next Amazon? Research your options carefully before jumping into the stock market. Experienced investors like Warren Buffett recommend starting out with index funds. These investments hold every stock in an index like the S&P 500, and offer low fees. They also fluctuate with the market, so they offer less risk than picking individual stocks.

As anyone who shops for the one-piece garment knows, finding a simple dress with pockets is tough — and probably even more so when it comes to a wedding gown.

But pockets are basically the perfect solution for brides who don’t want to carry a separate purse throughout their wedding day. They're the ideal place to store tissues for sniffles during the ceremony, mints for that special kiss, lipstick for touch ups and any other small wedding day must-have items.

Ingenious! @EstherKeziaT/Twitter

The bride wishes to keep her identity private, but Kezia Thorpe confirmed to TODAY Style that the beautiful strapless dress was created by British designer Suzanne Neville.

The viral photo inspired many other women to post photos of their own wedding dresses with pockets too.

KFC gives huge sum of money to parents who named newborn daughter after Colonel Sanders

KFC has given an enormous sum of money to a family who named their newborn daughter after the chain's founder Colonel Sanders.

The little girl's college fund is $11,000 (£8,600) larger after her parents deliberately named Harland Rose after Colonel Harland Sanders in a baby naming competition.

The idea is to give the old-timey name a boost among youngsters.

KFC US wrote on Twitter: ""I'm as pleased as pumpkin punch to announce the winner of our Baby Harland Naming Contest and the Harland who will be ushering in an all-new generation of Harlands, little Harland Rose.""

Image: KFC/Twitter) KFC/Twitter)

Baby Harland Rose was born on September 9, at 8lbs 1oz on what would have been the Colonel's 128th birthday, according to the fast food giant.

Harland was given $11,000 towards her education as a nod to the 11 different herbs and spices KFC fry their chicken in - nice.

The company announced the competition back in August, stipulating that the first family to name their baby Harland on September 9 would receive the huge sum of money.

The news has divided people on social media, who have differing opinions on the announcement.

One wrote ""Poor kid"" on KFC's post, while another wrote: ""Pffft! She was named after a fried chicken joint!""

Someone replied: ""She was not named after a fried chicken joint; she was named after one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. I would consider it an honor.""

Others speculated about how the parents will explain the name choice to their daughter in the future.

One said: ""Lol, so the parents will have to explain to them how they named her in the future... 'Well honey, we were offered a lump sum of cash to name you after the CEO of a fast food chain'...""

Listen to music. ,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/this-elegant-life-advice-from-an-australian-woman-who-died-of-cancer-at-27-is-going-viral-2018-1,"A post written by a 27-year old Australian woman who died of cancer last week has gone viral on Facebook with almost 50,000 shares and 60,000 likes.

Holly Butcher from Grafton, Australia, suffered from Ewing’s sarcoma, which is often found in the bone and surrounding soft tissue.

She wrote the note before her death last Thursday, and asked her friends and family to post it to her Facebook after she died.

The post includes simple life advice on how to accept life as it is, and not to get upset about small things that don’t really matter, such as not getting enough sleep, not having the body shape you really want, or spending too much time worrying that your perceived life on social media doesn’t meet the expectations of others.

She suggests that life is more about spending time with others, giving rather than receiving, and has one very good reason as to why you should never be late meeting a friend.

Below is a section of her moving post, which you can read in full here.

Be grateful for each day you don’t have pain and even the days where you are unwell with man flu, a sore back or a sprained ankle, accept it is shit but be thankful it isn’t life threatening and will go away.

Whinge less, people! .. And help each other more.

Give, give, give. It is true that you gain more happiness doing things for others than doing them for yourself. I wish I did this more. Since I have been sick, I have met the most incredibly giving and kind people and been the receiver of the most thoughtful and loving words and support from my family, friends and strangers; More than I could I ever give in return. I will never forget this and will be forever grateful to all of these people.

It is a weird thing having money to spend at the end.. when you’re dying. It’s not a time you go out and buy material things that you usually would, like a new dress. It makes you think how silly it is that we think it is worth spending so much money on new clothes and ‘things’ in our lives.

Buy your friend something kind instead of another dress, beauty product or jewellery for that next wedding. 1. No-one cares if you wear the same thing twice 2. It feels good. Take them out for a meal, or better yet, cook them a meal. Shout their coffee. Give/ buy them a plant, a massage or a candle and tell them you love them when you give it to them.

Value other people’s time. Don’t keep them waiting because you are shit at being on time. Get ready earlier if you are one of those people and appreciate that your friends want to share their time with you, not sit by themselves, waiting on a mate. You will gain respect too! Amen sister.

This year, our family agreed to do no presents and despite the tree looking rather sad and empty (I nearly cracked Christmas Eve!), it was so nice because people didn’t have the pressure of shopping and the effort went into writing a nice card for each other. Plus imagine my family trying to buy me a present knowing they would probably end up with it themselves.. strange! It might seem lame but those cards mean more to me than any impulse purchase could. Mind you, it was also easier to do in our house because we had no little kiddies there. Anyway, moral of the story- presents are not needed for a meaningful Christmas. Moving on.

Use your money on experiences.. Or at least don’t miss out on experiences because you spent all your money on material shit.

Put in the effort to do that day trip to the beach you keep putting off. Dip your feet in the water and dig your toes in the sand. Wet your face with salt water.

Get amongst nature.

Try just enjoying and being in moments rather than capturing them through the screen of your phone. Life isn’t meant to be lived through a screen nor is it about getting the perfect photo.. enjoy the bloody moment, people! Stop trying to capture it for everyone else.

Random rhetorical question. Are those several hours you spend doing your hair and make up each day or to go out for one night really worth it? I’ve never understood this about females ????.

Get up early sometimes and listen to the birds while you watch the beautiful colours the sun makes as it rises.

Listen to music.. really listen. Music is therapy. Old is best.

Cuddle your dog. Far out, I will miss that.

Talk to your friends. Put down your phone. Are they doing okay?

Travel if it’s your desire, don’t if it’s not.

Work to live, don’t live to work.

Seriously, do what makes your heart feel happy.

Eat the cake. Zero guilt.

Say no to things you really don’t want to do.

Don’t feel pressured to do what other people might think is a fulfilling life.. you might want a mediocre life and that is so okay.

Tell your loved ones you love them every time you get the chance and love them with everything you have.

Also, remember if something is making you miserable, you do have the power to change it – in work or love or whatever it may be. Have the guts to change. You don’t know how much time you’ve got on this earth so don’t waste it being miserable. I know that is said all the time but it couldn’t be more true.

Anyway, that’s just this one young gals life advice. Take it or leave it, I don’t mind!

Oh and one last thing, if you can, do a good deed for humanity (and myself) and start regularly donating blood. It will make you feel good with the added bonus of saving lives. I feel like it is something that is so overlooked considering every donation can save 3 lives! That is a massive impact each person can have and the process really is so simple.

Blood donation (more bags than I could keep up with counting) helped keep me alive for an extra year – a year I will be forever grateful that I got to spend it here on Earth with my family, friends and dog. A year I had some of the greatest times of my life.

..’Til we meet again.

Attention, attention! The answer to one of the most pressing questions of all time — that is, how long should one dunk an oreo for the best possible bite? — has finally been discovered. That question, which we have surely all pondered at least once, was taken to the lab by a group of mechanical engineers at Utah State University who felt it was their destiny to determine the prime dunking time for an Oreo to be best devoured.

As Grub Street reports, the researchers discovered that the “peak time” to dunk an Oreo in milk is — drumroll, please — for four seconds. They found that the cookie will soak up 50 percent of the fluid in the first second it hits the milk, and by the fourth second, the Oreo has reached “maximum absorption,” and should be consumed. And because it’s Thirsty Thursday, and a glass of almond milk is less guilty-inducing than a margarita, we say treat yo’self. Happy dunking!

Run away. ,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/heres-what-to-do-if-attacked-by-swarm-wasps-bees/,"You know what you absolutely shouldn’t do if you see a wasp nest holed up inside your property? Attack it yourself. Although YouTube videos make it seem tempting to use detergent, vacuum cleaners, or even explosives (hi there, America) to clear out the invading critters with their stinging butt javelins, you really should call a professional.

Either way, it seems that enough of you have been chased by a swarm of wasps – in some cases, after accidentally disturbing their nests – for BBC News and a few other places to explain what best to do in this situation.

To be fair, wasps, whether you’re dealing with yellowjackets or hornets, as well as bees can be pretty dangerous. Per Lifehacker, they account for 33 percent of all animal-related deaths for over-20s in the US. The collective injection of their venom into your body can certainly provoke some horrific and sometimes deadly reactions, that’s for sure, so knowing what to do in the event of an attack is paramount.

So – what should you do? The best advice is pretty obvious: don’t go near their nests. If you leave them alone, they won’t feel threatened and they’ll leave you be too, contrary to what your instinctual fears may be telling you.

The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) offers some important advice that’s admittedly difficult to stick to. “Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees,” a blog post explains. “Don't wave your arms around or swat at them.” If you do, you’ll just provoke them to attack you further, as you’ll look more threatening.

You shouldn’t even swat at them individually. If you do, they may release pheromones that attract more wasps or bees your way, according to the British Pest Control Association.

If you're somewhere in the Americas and you get particularly unlucky, the swarm may be comprised of Africanized honey bees. Although featuring less venom per bee than others, their swarms are more populous, faster, and more aggressive.

In that event, the US Department of Agriculture advises that you “RUN away quickly” – the capitalization being theirs.",Here's What To Do If You're Attacked By A Swarm Of Wasps Or Bees

Music can make you laugh, make you cry, give you chills, shake your booty, or—as anyone who has ever attended an evening performance at the symphony knows too well—put you to sleep. Emerging research from sleep scientists around the world says that there’s a good reason for this, and now you can exploit it to make your own bedtime even cozier.

Music has been used in healing ceremonies for thousands of years and across cultures—but let’s talk about a surprising new study out of Hong Kong. Researchers found that study participants who listened to music for 30 to 45 minutes before bed every night for three months fell asleep more quickly, slept more deeply, and felt better the next morning. The catch: The songs they listened to were all set at tempos between 60 and 80 beats per minute—our approximate heart rate when falling asleep. (Here are more secrets for a deeper sleep.)

That’s right: You can literally trick your body into relaxing by syncing your heart rate with peaceful music. In this way, listening to music becomes a form of meditation; by mindfully listening to your surroundings, your heart rate slows, your blood pressure lowers, your anxiety abates, and life becomes a peaceful song.

Of course, the same is true of energetic music: The Royal Automobile Club Foundation for Motoring ranked Wagner’s “Ride of The Valkyries” as the world’s most dangerous song for motorists, thanks to a frenzied tempo (nearly 100 bpm) that challenges drivers’ normal sense of speed. (Saying “Sorry, officer, I was just Wagner-ing” probably is not going to get you out of a speeding ticket.)

Armed with findings about the irresistible link between backbeat and heartbeat, sleep therapists have even begun collaborating with musicians to create what could become known to history as the chillest music ever. In 2011, the English trio known as Marconi Union worked with the British Academy of Sound Therapy to create an eight-minute instrumental track called “Weightless,” designed to lull the listener into relaxation through proven heart-rate-lowering sounds and tempos (beginning at 60 bpm, and stealthily slowing to 50 bpm by the end.)

And it worked, too. In a recent UK study, participants challenged with solving difficult puzzles while listening to various types of music showed a whopping 65 per cent reduction in anxiety (and therefore an improvement in performance) while listening to “Weightless.” (That pretty much makes ""Weightless"" the anti-Valkyrie.) As an addendum, study moderator Dr. David Lewis-Hodgson of Mindlab International even said: “I would advise against driving while listening to the song because it could be dangerous.""

I present to you what is undoubtedly the greatest name for ​a football player in the entire history of the world thus far. A name so perfect, so stunningly beautiful that it makes you wonder whether this kid's parents were comedians in their spare time.

​​Yes, Steele Fortress!





The fact that his first name is Steele and not Steel makes this even better. It means that, to some extent at least, his parents weren't just intentionally naming him something funny. They actually just liked the name Steele, and the humor followed.





Also, it is obviously the synergy between first and last name that makes this so good. Sure, we've seen guys with a last name like Slaughter or something like that, but to have both names work so well together is pretty unique.

Mr. Fortress is an incoming freshman ​quarterback for the Michigan Tech squad, and you can bet that his teammates are not going to let him live down this name all season long.

​​My only question is: does this guy have siblings? And if so, what are their names?





Their parents can't have just named any other kids Tom, Joe, and Mary after having a son named Steele. We need investigative reporters on this immediately.

Weiner isn't a particularly uncommon surname, so you think you'd be able to use it online without any problems.

But a woman called Natalie Weiner says she has been blocked from creating online accounts because of her ""offensive name"".

Natalie shared a screenshot on Twitter of her attempt to set up an account - she was denied because ""offensive language discovered in the last name field"".

She wrote: ""this is without a doubt the best thing that has ever happened to me"", adding: ""I am weeping"".

The post received over 21,000 likes - and even better, it turns out she isn't the only one who has encountered this problem.

She received a spate of replies from people whose names are too rude for the internet.

A man called Philip Sporn commented: ""When I got my computer I had to set my last name as 'Spron' because Sporn contains offensive language"". Someone called Ben Schmuch said: ""Happens to me all the time"".

There were plenty of others too, who showed their solidarity.

Some websites use algorithms to stop people putting incorrect or offensive content into their systems - but clearly it went wrong in this case.

Of course, I usually like the sweet and dessert-like flavors the most, but other flavors can also be very intriguing. One of the newest international offerings from Oreo taps into some very unique foods for its newest cookies. With that, you might be wondering where to buy Oreo's Hot Chicken Wing and Wasabi flavors. Well, if you really want to get your hands on these spicy snacks, you'll need to grab your passport.

In a move that could turn the dessert-snack world on its head, Oreo's parent company, Mondelez International, introduced the Hot Chicken Wing and Wasabi flavors in a tweet on Tuesday, Aug. 21. Currently, these new flavors are only available in China, per Mondelez. So, if you're really set on trying these new spicy fillings that are sandwiched between the chocolate Oreo wafers that you know and love, you'll have to head to China. Elite Daily reached out to Mondelez for a more detailed flavor description of these head-turning flavors but did not hear back at the time of publication.

Unfortunately, I couldn't even find these hot cookies on Amazon at the time of publication.

TBH, I'm not sure if these new Oreo flavors will turn out to be unexpected food combinations that somehow totally makes sense — or if one bite will make you wish you kept your dinner and dessert flavors separated — but I guess there's only one way to find out.

One thing you can count on with these treats is guaranteed spice. Per Design Taxi, Oreo describes its new offerings as ""salty and spicy."" Oh, and don't be fooled by the vibrant orange and green colors at first glance, thinking that these might be some kind of creamsicle or matcha cookies (TBH, I totally thought the Wasabi cookie was a green tea flavor at first look), because Oreo told Design Taxi that these new offerings are flavors ""you never knew"" existed.

OREO

I tend to agree with the cookie company that I also never thought that I'd see a Hot Chicken Wing Oreo, yet here it is. Oreo lovers not living China will have to be satisfied with photos and descriptions of the new cookies, because China is currently the only location where you can buy these amped-up treats. If you're salivating over (or questioning the existence of) these Wasabi and Hot Chicken Wing Oreos in the United States, there are sadly no current plans for sale of the snack stateside, per Mondelez.

There's no need to get too bummed about the fact that you can't grab these flavors in the United States, because there are also plenty of new U.S. flavors that you can enjoy. If you're trying to keep that summer feeling as September quickly creeps up, you can get a quintessential taste of the season with Oreo State Fair Cookies, which are very similar to the deep-fried Oreos that you'll find at practically every state fair across the country.

Weekly. ,https://doyouremember.com/82876/how-often-you-should-wash-sheets,"It’s no secret every so often you should throw your bedsheets in the wash and replace them with new, clean sheets. Results from a 2015 study may surprise you as to how often you should be washing them. We originally published this back in 2018, but with the holiday season in full swing, clean bed sheets are a must for your out of town guests(even the inlaws). After all, no one wants to wake up with bed bugs. Dirty sheets are the perfect place for harboring those nasty critters.

Philip M. Tierno, a Clinical Professor for the Department of Pathology at NYU School of Medicine shared his insight on the truth about dirty bedsheets. In 2015 he told Tech Insider, “You have spores of fungi, bacteria, animal dander, pollen, soil, lint, finishing agents of whatever the sheets are made from, coloring material, all sorts of excrements from the body including sweat, sputum, vaginal, and anal excretions, urine milieu, skin cells.”… grossed out yet?

How Often You Should Wash Bed Sheets

A 2015 study assessed the level of fungal contamination in bedding revealed between 4 and 17 different species of fungus(eww). They conducted this study with both feather and synthetic pillows ranging from one and a half to twenty years old. Tierno says that the number of bacteria and other types of debris that can accumulate in such a short time on our bedding should be a cause for concern when we leave our sheets for too long.

You might be stressed. ,https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwkpka/this-is-what-it-means-if-slow-walkers-make-you-furious,"Chances are you have felt it at least once in your life, if not every damned day: the bubbling rage working through your veins, filling your soul, consuming your being, as you find yourself trapped behind a slow walker. Whether targeting people for moseying on a busy walkway while using their phones, groups for spreading out and forming plodding barricades, or tourists for being, well, tourists, screeds against slow walkers are a dime a dozen online.

This anger is so common it actually has an academic designation: sidewalk rage. Leon James, a University of Hawaii psychologist and leading expert on the phenomenon, likens it to road rage. While we often talk about sidewalk rage as an internal irk, or “private mental venting that consists of irrational assumptions regarding other pedestrians,” the feelings can escalate through fantasies of “violent acts against the inconsiderate sidewalk blockers” in some to “the overt expression of hostility and aggressiveness,"" James notes. Yet for all most of us know about sidewalk rage, few understand where it comes from, or why some feel it more acutely—at times or always—than others.

Sign up for Coping, Tonic's weekly newsletter about anxiety, depression, and dealing with it all.

Fast walkers often imply—if cheekily—that their rage stems from the fact that they are, in a cosmic sense, in the right. They trot out studies that suggest faster walkers may be less likely to die of heart disease, develop Alzheimer’s disease, or see their prostate cancer worsen, and that slow walkers seem to die earlier than the fleeter footed. (The causality between walking speed and the outcomes noted in these studies remains uncertain; walking speed could actually have nothing to do with them, or stand in for some other causal factor.)

They also argue that slow walkers are breaking implicit social rules in a city or culture that dictate how to use a walkway. (To wit, in New York: keep to the right, follow the flow of foot traffic, watch where you’re going, don’t cluster up if you’re moving in a large group, and for god’s sake veer off to the edge of the sidewalk if you insist on stopping or slowing down.)

Psychologists suggest that the rage some of us feel stems primarily from our own expectations and emotional states. Many people walk on autopilot based on our own expectation of how long it will take us to reach our endpoint, notes Marc Wittmann of the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health. Finding someone suddenly blocking our path breaks our autopilot: “The more we are on autopilot mode,” Wittmann says, “the less we can accept a sudden slowed pace.”

More from VICE:

This jarring breech of our expectations is stressful. But of course, it's even more stressful if we are already in a stressed mode to begin with. What’s more, when this interruption of expectations triggers rage, it can warp our perception of time. Our lack of control and anger make us feel like the moments we spend trapped behind someone are an eternity, which risks annoying us further.

It's hardly surprising that city dwellers seem to report the most sidewalk rage. As Wittmann notes, urban centers seem to encourage a faster average pace, and the conveniences of modern life shred our patience. Competition for personal space can also trigger or exacerbate this rage, James says. So it's fairly easy for a fast-moving, impatient city dweller to run into a snag that breaks that autopilot pace and exacerbates the latent stress many busy people may feel.

Living in a city, however, is hardly the only predictor of sidewalk rage, James says. He sees it as a socially learned behavior, both from our parents and through media. So our training as we grow up regarding how to process or react to the inconveniences plays a strong role, too. James seems to believe that sidewalk rage is a growing problem, which makes sense given the fact that modern life, especially in cities, is getting faster—and for many, more stressful. While many people might brush this off as a minor annoyance of modernity, however, James says that he sees it as “a public mental health crisis that needs to be addressed and reversed,” to reduce the violence it sometimes creates, aid our wellbeing, and improve civility in public life.

Fortunately, it's not too difficult to quell feelings of sidewalk rage in the moment. Usually when we feel irritated by a slow walker—or a fast walker trying to muscle past us, James notes—we “recite the details of another pedestrian's ‘objectionable’ behavior',” which intensifies our negative feelings. We also tend to fixate on our own stress, like how late we’re running. We just have to break these mental patterns, James says, through “motivation and self-training” in our everyday life.

This often involves simply stopping and recognizing when we’re starting to feel rage, dissecting that feeling, and acknowledging that someone is not evil for moving at their own pace. In those moments, we also need to understand that we are the ones in “activation mode,” who likely need to learn how to switch into a more relaxed, accepting mode if there is nothing we can do to escape an inconvenience, Wittmann notes. “You become a happier human being,” he says, “when you are able to change modes. You have more control over your emotions and life.”

Some people may reject the idea that they need to change, still insisting that slow walkers are in the cultural or moral wrong. Those people will likely feel sidewalk rage all of their lives. But for those who want to conquer these feelings, this mental shift and control is not as hard to develop as it may seem, as there are many simple exercises one can do to cultivate it. “I advise nervous people to go to a supermarket and choose the longest line at the cashier booths,” Wittmann says. “Say to yourself: Now I have time for myself and I can relax for a moment.” Accept that a slow moment now and then is normal, perhaps even a gift, if you are willing to take it as such, rather than berating others for not moving at the same speed.",This Is What it Means if Slow Walkers Make You Furious

So why did NASA choose to release images that look like sanitary towels? These people weren't the only ones who were curious about that.

Well, the answer is that the image is a composite of several different photos taken by Juno as it flies over. They are then stitched together to make one photo, rather than many smaller patchy photographs of the planet.

As hydrating as regular water. ,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sparkling-water-hydrate_n_5b23fc66e4b0783ae128f589,"As the weather heats up and we all begin looking for delicious (and healthy) ways to stay hydrated, a couple persistent questions come up: Is sparkling water actually hydrating, and is it as good for us as plain water?

Downing glasses of sparkling water can feel a little bit like cheating, because its effervescence is so similar to that of sugary soda. And with $1.8 billion sold in 2017 (thanks in large part to America’s current obsession with La Croix), it looks like lots of us enjoy the bubbly stuff.

The CDC recommends drinking sparkling water as a healthy alternative to soda and other high-calorie beverages, but is it really hydrating us just as well as a plain glass of still water?

While there are many brands, flavors and choices on the market, for the purpose of this article, we’re talking about unflavored sparkling water, or seltzer, which is simply water that has had pressurized carbon dioxide dissolved into it. The carbon dioxide is what creates that effervescence, or the bubbles, making sparkling water seemingly so much more fun than plain tap water.

A number of myths have been floating around the internet on the subject of sparkling water and its negative side effects. Now to dispel a few.

Myth 1: Sparkling water destroys tooth enamel.

Advertisement

Good news for sparkling water fans! The pH level of sparkling water (at a pH of 5) is not low enough to erode tooth enamel, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Dental Association. But while plain sparkling water’s carbonation doesn’t hurt tooth enamel, be careful about other fizzy drinks’ acids (think colas), which can wreak havoc on your oral health.

Check out the label on your sparkling water: It’s best to choose waters without added flavorings, sugars and citric acids if you’re concerned about your dental health, as these were found to have the most erosive potential for teeth.

Myth 2: Sparkling water leaches calcium from bones, potentially causing osteoporosis.

While studies have demonstrated that soda consumption is linked to decreased bone mineral density, particularly in women, this has to do with cola consumption specifically, rather than carbonated beverages. Rather, in another study in which researchers had one group of participants drink 1 liter of carbonated water a day and another group drink 1 liter of still a day for 8 weeks, no difference was detected between the two groups in terms of bone density loss.

Myth 3: Sparkling water is not as hydrating as water.

More good news: Sparkling water is just as hydrating as plain water.

The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition compared still, sparkling and other popular drinks (cola, juices, beer, coffee, tea and milk), finding that there was no difference between them in terms of hydration.

This may not jibe with what you’ve heard about coffee and tea having a dehydrating effect on our bodies, but studies have shown that habitual coffee and tea drinkers don’t get dehydrated by those beverages when consumed in moderation. In fact, coffee drinkers consuming a regular 3 to 6 cups a day weren’t found to have any changes to total body water. Essentially, regular caffeine consumption in the form of coffee and tea is hydrating as the body has become accustomed to the caffeine, which would otherwise act as a diuretic or a dehydrating factor. Irregular caffeine consumption in the form of tea and coffee, however, is dehydrating.

Back to sparkling water, though: The USDA does recommend sparkling water as a good alternative to sugary drinks as a good way to reduce your risk for obesity.

The only time you might want to choose still over sparkling is when you’re working out: The carbonation in sparkling water can cause a build-up of gas and lead to bloating and discomfort.",Does Sparkling Water Hydrate You As Well As Regular Water?

A coal bucket. ,https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/09/compare-investing-gambling.asp,"Investing vs. Gambling: An Overview

How many times during a discussion about finances have you heard someone say, ""Investing in the stock market is just like gambling at a casino""? True, investing and gambling both involve risk and choice—specifically, the risk of capital with hopes of future profit. But gambling is typically a short-lived activity, while equities investing can last a lifetime. Also, there is a negative expected return to gamblers, on average and over the long run. On the other hand, investing in the stock market typically carries with it a positive expected return on average over the long run.

Key Takeaways Investing and gambling both involve risking capital in the hopes of making a profit.

In both gambling and investing, a key principle is to minimize risk while maximizing reward.

Gamblers have fewer ways to mitigate losses than investors do.

Investors have more sources of relevant information than gamblers do.

Over time, the odds will be in your favor as an investor and not in your favor as a gambler.

Investing

Investing is the act of allocating funds or committing capital to an asset, like stocks, with the expectation of generating an income or profit. The expectation of a return in the form of income or price appreciation is the core premise of investing. Risk and return go hand-in-hand in investing; low risk generally means low expected returns, while higher returns are usually accompanied by higher risk.

Investors must always decide how much money they want to risk. Some traders typically risk 2-5% of their capital base on any particular trade. Longer-term investors constantly hear the virtues of diversification across different asset classes. However, risk and return expectations can vary widely within the same asset class, especially if it's a large one, as the equities class is. For example, a blue-chip stock that trades on the New York Stock Exchange will have a very different risk-return profile from a micro-cap stock that trades on a small exchange.

This, in essence, is an investment risk management strategy: Spreading your capital across different assets, or different types of assets within the same class, will likely help minimize potential losses.

In order to enhance their holdings' performance, some investors study trading patterns by interpreting stock charts. Stock market technicians try to leverage the charts to glean where the stock is going in the future. This area of study dedicated to analyzing charts is commonly referred to as technical analysis.

Investment returns can be affected by the amount of commission an investor must pay a broker to buy or sell stocks on their behalf.

When you gamble, you own nothing, but when you invest in a stock, you own a share of the underlying company; in fact, some companies actually reimburse you for your ownership, in the form of stock dividends.

Gambling

Gambling is defined as staking something on a contingency. Also known as betting or wagering, it means risking money on an event that has an uncertain outcome and heavily involves chance.

Like investors, gamblers must also carefully weigh the amount of capital they want to put ""in play."" In some card games, pot odds are a way of assessing your risk capital versus your risk-reward: the amount of money to call a bet compared to what is already in the pot. If the odds are favorable, the player is more likely to ""call"" the bet.

Most professional gamblers are quite proficient at risk management. They research player or team history, or a horse's bloodlines and track record. Seeking an edge, card players typically look for cues from the other players at the table; great poker players can remember what their opponents wagered 20 hands back. They also study the mannerisms and betting patterns of their opponents with the hope of gaining useful information.

In casino gambling, the bettor is playing against ""the house."" In sports gambling, and in lotteries—two of the most common ""gambling"" activities in which the average person engages—bettors are in a sense betting against each other because the number of players helps determine the odds. In horse racing, for example, placing a bet is actually a wager against other bettors: The odds on each horse are determined by the amount of money bet on that horse, and constantly change up until the race actually starts.

Generally, the odds are stacked against gamblers: The probability of losing an investment is usually higher than the probability of winning more than the investment. A gambler's chances of making a profit can also be reduced if they have to put up an additional amount of money beyond their bet, referred to as ""points,"" which is kept by the house whether the bettor wins or loses. Points are comparable to the broker commission or trading fee an investor pays.

Investing vs. Gambling: Key Differences

In both gambling and investing, a key principle is to minimize risk while maximizing profits. But when it comes to gambling, the house always has an edge—a mathematical advantage over the player that increases the longer they play.

In contrast, the stock market constantly appreciates over the long term. This doesn't mean that a gambler will never hit the jackpot, and it also doesn't mean that a stock investor will always enjoy a positive return. It is simply that over time, if you keep playing, the odds will be in your favor as an investor and not in your favor as a gambler.

""Neither get in nor get out is an investing strategy. Period. That's just gambling on moments in time. And investing should always be a disciplined process over time,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, managing director & chief investment strategist of Charles Schwab.

Mitigating Loss

Another key difference between investing and gambling: You have few ways to limit your losses. If you pony up $10 a week for the NFL office pool and you don't win, you're out all of your capital. When betting on any pure gambling activity, there are no loss-mitigation strategies. Newer innovations to online sportsbooks have been added to help gamblers mitigate risks when betting on games such as in-play bettering, which can be changed throughout gameplay, and partial cash-out options, which allow recovery of part of one's wager if an outcome seems to be going against the best.

In contrast, stock investors and traders have a variety of options to prevent total loss of risked capital. Setting stop losses on your stock investment is a simple way to avoid undue risk. If your stock drops 10% below its purchase price, you have the opportunity to sell that stock to someone else and still retain 90% of your risk capital. However, if you bet $100 that the Jacksonville Jaguars will win the Super Bowl this year, you cannot get part of your money back if they just make it to the Super Bowl. And even if they did win the Super Bowl, don't forget about that point spread: If the team does not win by more points than given by the bettor, the bet is a loss.

The Time Factor

Another key difference between the two activities has to do with the concept of time. Gambling is a time-bound event, while an investment in a company can last several years. With gambling, once the game or race or hand is over, your opportunity to profit from your wager has come and gone. You either have won or lost your capital.

Stock investing, on the other hand, can be time-rewarding. Investors who purchase shares in companies that pay dividends are actually rewarded for their risked dollars. Companies pay you money regardless of what happens to your risk capital, as long as you hold onto their stock. Savvy investors realize that returns from dividends are a key component to making money in stocks over the long term.

Getting Information

Both stock investors and gamblers look to the past, studying historical performance and current behavior to improve their chances of making a winning move. Information is a valuable commodity in the world of gambling as well as stock investing. But there's a difference in the availability of information.

Stock and company information is readily available for public use. Company earnings, financial ratios, and management teams can be researched and studied, either directly or via research analyst reports, before committing capital. Stock traders who make hundreds of transactions a day can use the day's activities to help with future decisions.

In contrast, if you sit down at a blackjack table in Las Vegas, you have no information about what happened an hour, a day, or a week ago at that particular table. You may hear that the table is either hot or cold, but that information is not quantifiable.",Going All-In: Investing vs. Gambling
A pen exploded in her hair and she bleached it out in 5 minutes. ,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/bride-ruins-hair-just-days-13115709,"We've all done this before, but probably with less disastrous consequences

Bride-to-be ruins hair just days before wedding with very simple mistake - and we've all done it

We've all been there. Your hair is getting in the way but you don't have a hair band handy.

So you twist it, wrap it into a bun and stick a pen through it to keep it in place. Most us do this without even sparing a thought for what could happen if it all goes wrong and the pen leaks.

A bride-to-be with platinum blonde hair learned her lesson on this one the hard way.

Just a week before her wedding , Daphne Martin took a pen out of her hair only to find it had left a massive inky blue patch over her blonde locks. Not ideal.

""I was working at Costco at the time, and I had put a pen into my messy ponytail,"" she told Allure . ""A coworker approached me and told me what had happened, and I was in complete shock.""

Fortunately, Daphne had previously trained as a hair stylist, so she was better placed than most of us to sort out the mishap.

She put her fiancé to work as her assistant and washed her hair in the kitchen sink before applying bleach to her hair.

""I washed the area, blew it out, and then applied bleach. Surprisingly enough, five minutes of bleach got that out of my extremely light hair. My hair was back to normal that day — even an hour later, thank goodness.""

It's seriously impressive that she managed to pull it off in just five minutes, but arguably having platinum hair actually made it easier to bleach out.

If she had darker hair, she could have ended up making the blue hair and surrounding area lighter and would then have had to blend it back in with another colour.

Luckily her hair was back to being perfectly platinum in time for the big day - but we're sure she'll think twice about pinning her hair up with a pen next tine.

We can learn from this one - keep the pen AWAY from the hair from now on.",Bride-to-be ruins hair just days before wedding with very simple mistake

Remember when all of your problems could be solved by throwing down a banana peel, causing your opponent to comically spin out behind you, leading you to victory and temporarily broken friendships? Well that was just Mario Kart, and now you’re an adult, but could it still work in real life?

The folks over at Hoonigan setup a real life banana peel traction test with a 2018 Audi RS5, to see just how effective the fruit skin could be at taking out a car.

They tried launching the car on the bananas, where there was the most impact on traction, as well as multiple, so many, skids through the small field of peels to see if there was any crippling impact on the car’s performance.

You Must Learn a Language Before You’re 18 to Be Fluent, Research Says

India Irving Social Media Editor 8 June 2018 View

An online quiz has uncovered the magic number of language learning.

The data suggests that after the age of 18 most people can no longer learn a language fluently. The quiz was conceived as part of a new Boston College study led by Joshua Hartshorne. It promised to guess test-takers’ native language or dialect based on their answers to a series of questions. However, the real purpose of the quiz was to measure participants’ proficiency with complex grammar and see how this correlated to the age at which they learned English.

Almost 700,000 questionnaires later, answered by internet users from all over the world, the results were in. The majority of English speakers who were deemed fluent had learned the language no later than 18 years of age, and the earlier they started learning, the more proficiently they spoke in adult life. Previously, puberty was widely thought to be the cut-off point for the ‘critical period’ during which humans are able to fluidly acquire a language. Hartshorne’s research allots a few more years for people to up their language count.

Culture Trip spoke to 26-year-old Alex Rawlings, a British polyglot who speaks 15 languages to varying abilities, about the new data. Four of his ‘five best’ languages – English, Greek, German and Spanish – fall in line with the timetable pointed to by the research. However he did not begin learning his fifth fluent language, Russian, until he was 19.

‘It’s difficult to argue with the science but I think what’s important is what we do with this information,’ he tells us. ‘The data is saying that if we don’t learn a language by a certain age we’re screwed and that the younger we start, the better. So while we certainly shouldn’t be telling adults they can’t learn languages, because many adults can and do, if we really do think the ideal time for children to learn a language is by 18, then we need to start teaching them’.

Alex explains that he believes the way language is taught in British schools is focused too much on academics and lacks passion and practicality. ‘It’s not just another school subject, it’s an amazing tool that gives you access to the world.‘","You Must Learn a Language Before You’re 18 to Be Fluent, Research Says"
"Over, that way it doesn't touch the wall. ",https://www.shared.com/hang-toilet-paper/,"Tomato, tomato. I'm sure you pronounced those same two words differently.

Toilet paper hanging over, or under? Not quite the same, am I right?

The over-or-under debate has been around for as long as I can remember.

Turns out, the way you hang your toilet says a lot about your personality.

A study published in The Independent by Dr. Gilda Carle found that people who prefer to have their toilet paper hanging over, where the loose end is draped over the top, are more likely to have a dominant personality.

And people who position the roll under, where the loose end is hanging inside next to the wall, are more likely to be less assertive and more empathetic and easy going.

All that being said, there is actually a right way to hang a roll of toilet paper, and you'd benefit from changing the position if you've been doing it wrong.

Why There's Only One Right Way

The tribe has spoken (when I say tribe, I mean science) that hanging your toilet paper the wrong way can make people sick, lead to lawsuits, and worker's compensation payments.

A 2011 study by the University of Colorado discovered that even the cleanest public restrooms are covered in dangerous bacteria that could make you very sick.

Their findings identified 19 groups of bacteria on the doors, floors, soap dispenser, faucet handles, and toilets.

Simply touching any of these surfaces puts you at risk of getting sick, and the problem is that most people are not washing their hands properly to get rid of these dangerous bacteria strains.

I don't think anyone's surprised by that, but here's where things got interesting...

The researchers discovered a lot of e.coli, which comes from human feces, around the toilet.

This bacteria can easily be transferred to your hands, and cause health problems, like food poisoning.

So if the toilet paper is hung ""under,"" there's a chance that someone's fingers could come in contact with the wall. And because the toilet paper is closer to the wall, it brushes against it, and the next person's hands can get contaminated.

Also, when the toilet paper is hung under, someone's hands may come in contact with the top of the toilet paper as they're trying to rip out however much they need.

That's why hanging the toilet paper ""over"" is the right way.

A person's fingers would only be able to touch the toilet paper that they will use.

Now that you know this knowledge, it makes sense right? This is why many public restrooms have a toilet paper dispenser to restrict people from touching the whole roll.

According to Inc., employees have held their employers liable for food poisoning in the workplace.

And for good reason. In the worst cases, food poisoning can result in brain damage or death.

So what can you do to prevent yourself from getting sick, aside from letting coworkers know the right way to hang toilet paper?

Wash your hands properly for at least 20 seconds with warm water. And you might want to stay away from hand dryers.

Idris Elba is clearing the air when it comes to playing a certain martini-drinking, dapper-dressing British agent.

For years, it’s been speculated that the 45-year-old actor would soon step into the role of James Bond, though no official casting announcements have ever been made. Most recently, director Antoine Fuqua revealed to the Daily Star that he’s had discussions recently with EON Production’s Barbara Broccoli, who said “it is time” for a black actor to tackle the iconic character.

Unsurprisingly, this immediately had fans convinced that this was confirmation that Elba would be taking up the Bond mantle.

On Wednesday, a reporter with Good Morning Britain had Elba respond to the rumors by first inquiring if he was holding a martini and if it was shaken or stirred, referring to Bond's favorite cocktail. “Stir fried, actually,” Elba joked.

When straight-up asked if he'd be playing 007, the actor responded, “No.”

Elba's response comes after he tweeted earlier this month in response to the rumors, writing: “Don’t believe the HYPE.""

Back in 2016, Elba admitted on Good Morning America that he and the studio hadn’t even discussed the possibility of him playing Bond someday.

Don’t believe the HYPE... — Idris Elba (@idriselba) August 12, 2018

""If it was to happen it would be the will of the nation, because there's been no talks [between] me and the studio,"" he stated. ""If I'm really honest, I think I'm too old for that. I can't be running around in cars and ladies and martinis, who wants to do that? Sounds terrible.""

Story continues

MGM and EON Productions announced in 2017 that the 25th installment in the Bond franchise would be hitting U.S. theaters on Nov. 8, 2019. In May, the franchise’s most recent star, Daniel Craig, was confirmed to reprise the role.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but in this weekly column, Ripley’s puts those delusions to the test, turning your world upside down, because you can’t always…Believe It! Today: Can sharks smell blood from a mile away?

The Scent of Blood

Even though there’s just a 1 in 3.7 million chance of being killed by a shark, people are so fearful of the predators that they’ve developed myths about them—such as their ability to smell a tiny drop of blood from miles away.

While sharks do have a strong sense of smell, this statement is largely overblown. Some sharks can identify blood a quarter-mile away, but the scent doesn’t reach them instantaneously or necessarily cause them to attack.

Sharks have a heightened sense of smell and olfactory system that is hundreds of times stronger than a human’s. Their nostrils, located beneath their snouts, are used only for smelling and not for breathing. They do have the capacity to detect tiny amounts of various compounds in the water. Some types of sharks, such as the lemon shark, can even detect a scent in a large swimming pool or a substance that is several hundred meters away.

But a shark more than a quarter-mile away won’t smell your blood and decide to make you into a yummy snack. Smells reach a shark through the currents, and it would take time for the scent to travel that distance to a shark’s nostrils. The motion of the ocean carries smell molecules with it, so, the more motion, the faster the smell will travel.

If you do start to bleed while swimming in the ocean, there is some time to get safely to shore in case a rogue shark decides to attack.

Sharks really don’t like human meat and generally aren’t interested in the bodily fluids people excrete. “You can smell a landfill, but it won’t make you want to eat it,” noted Dr. Steve Kajiura of Florida Atlantic University’s Shark Lab.

The lemon shark, for example, can detect a small drop of blood in the water. But they are particular about what they eat. They enjoy munching on bony fish, mollusks, and crustaceans. Sometimes they will eat a seabird or a small shark. Humans are not on the menu.

Menstruating women can also relax. At most, a woman will secrete 80 ml of blood (around 6 tablespoons) and not all at once. To top it all off, according to National Geographic, 93 percent of shark attacks around the world between 1580 and 2010 were on males.

An average of 10 people die a year in shark attacks, which are usually the result of mistaken identity. Some types of sharks whose diet consists of sea lions and seals may bite a human to see what he or she tastes like. That test bite can be fatal because a shark’s numerous teeth can cause uncontrollable bleeding.

But when you get back and unpack the weekly shop, you might notice just how much plastic packaging you've acquired.

If you're concerned about the amount of plastic waste you're creating, you're not alone. A recent survey found that 92% of adults are concerned about plastic pollution and 78% are taking steps to reduce the single-use plastic they buy.

Don't know where to start? This guide will help you avoid plastic waste during your weekly supermarket trip.

The problem with plastic

It’s not hard to see why so many of us are worried about plastic pollution. Each year, the UK uses five million tonnes of plastic, and packaging accounts for almost half of this, according to Government figures. What’s more, roughly a third of all plastic used in packaging is single-use plastic produced by the UK’s top 10 supermarkets*.

Pressure on companies to reduce the amount of plastic they use has led to most of the UK’s leading supermarkets setting their own targets to reduce single-use plastic in the packaging of their own-brand products.

However, as the timeframes for meeting these targets vary considerably, what can shoppers do now to stem the tide of plastic when they shop for their groceries? And how easy is it to limit the plastic you take home when you do the weekly grocery shop?

We sent a member of our consumer team to do a mystery shop.

Is plastic-free shopping actually possible?

Armed with a shopping list of 32 commonly bought food products, including bread, cereal, ham and carrots, we headed to a branch of a leading supermarket to fill two trolleys – one with pre-packed and plastic-packaged goods, and the other with products packed in the least amount of plastic packaging possible.

To ensure we had access to a wide range of products and therefore the best possible chance of finding non-plastic-packaged food, we chose a larger, out-of-town superstore with a good selection of fresh food counters. These included hot and cold deli counters, fish and meat counters and an in-store bakery.

When we filled the second trolley, we opted for loose food items wherever possible (which we packed in our own reused paper bags and reusable food storage boxes) and hunted for food products in non-plastic packaging.

'Avoiding plastic requires legwork'

Even though we shopped in a large store, we only managed to find non-plastic-packaged alternatives for half of the 32 products on our list. For foods such as crisps, biscuits, breakfast cereal and bread – all of which risk going stale without the right packaging – the lack of a non-plastic-packaged alternative was unsurprising. But the availability of other products in anything other than plastic often seemed inconsistent.

We were able to buy fresh, unpackaged beef burgers from the meat counter and salmon fillets from the fish counter, but sausages were only available pre-packed. Fruit and veg such as broccoli, sweet peppers and bananas were all available to buy loose, but tomatoes, whole lettuces and oranges were not. Teabags couldn’t be bought without a covering of plastic film but this wasn’t used to package a box of loose leaf tea.

By opting for loose produce, buying from fresh food counters and seeking out alternatives to products packed in plastic, we managed to cut the number of pieces of single-use plastic waste generated by our shop by nearly 40%.

'Avoiding plastic in the supermarket is possible but requires a lot of legwork by the consumer,' says Emilie Martin, consumer affairs director at GH. 'And too often there just weren't the plastic-free alternatives there.'

Less plastic, but at a premium

For some products, while a non-plastic-packaged alternative was available, there was a premium to pay.

We bought 500g of own-brand easy-cook rice in a plastic packet for 80p, for example, but the same quantity in a cardboard packet cost £2.10. A 500ml plastic bottle of own-brand olive oil set us back £2.54, but the same quantity in a glass bottle cost £4.25. In both of these cases, there was no supermarket own-brand equivalent available in non-plastic packaging, so we had to opt for a branded product, which goes some way to explaining the difference in price.

Meanwhile, two pre-packed boneless salmon fillets cost £3.85, while the equivalent cost 85p more from the fresh fish counter. This meant that the total price of the items in our ‘non-plastic’ basket of goods was £3.50 dearer. This was largely due to there being such a limited range of non-plastic-packaged goods – especially own-brand goods – to choose from.

There was some good news, though. In the fruit and veg aisle, loose broccoli, baking potatoes and bananas worked out slightly cheaper than their pre-packed counterparts, and there was no price difference between loose and pre-packed brown onions or carrots. Branded honey in a glass jar was the same price as the same quantity of honey in a squeezy bottle and loose and pre-packed bread rolls and slices of honey roast ham were also identical in price. And when it came to buying instant coffee, every product was packaged in a glass jar, with the exception of one brand, which came in a tin.

What is your supermarket doing?

A survey by the Grocer found that around four in 10 of us are concerned about how much plastic packaging is used for our food and drink, and a third of 55-64 year olds do not think supermarkets have done enough to reduce plastic waste and provide sustainable alternatives.

To see if supermarkets have been putting their money where their mouths are, Greenpeace and the Environmental Investigation Agency ranked UK supermarkets according to the amount of widely recyclable plastic they use to package their own-brand products.

Out of the 10 leading supermarkets, Waitrose was ranked at #1 as they reported a big reduction in plastic use and a commitment to increasing the amount of reusable packaging they offer. Iceland came last and were ranked poorly for recycling and issues with supply chain.

Reuse and refill

As Covid introduced new safety concerns around loose food as well as increased financial hardship, it's easy to think that reducing plastic packaging has become less of a priority. However, a survey by FMCG found that 55% of people globally have become more concerned about the environment as a result of the pandemic.

Sustainability is clearly still a key issue for consumers. So what initiatives are supermarkets putting in place?

Before the pandemic started, Waitrose launched refill stations in several stores so customers can buy loose groceries, such as rice and pasta, in their own reusable containers. Tesco has introduced a similar service in 10 stores in east England. Sainsbury’s is replacing plastic fruit and veg bags in its stores with paper ones and Aldi is trialling paper and compostable carrier bags.

Environmental group Friends of the Earth reminds consumers tat reusing bags and refillable containers is always better than buying new ones — even if the new ones are made of sustainable materials.

‘Compostable bags are only compostable under certain conditions,’ explains FOE’s Carrie Hume. ‘And although paper bags can seem a better alternative than plastic, we still need to remember the high carbon footprint that comes from these when they’re only used once.'

We asked the three largest supermarkets what they were doing to tackle the problem of ‘avoidable’ plastic waste, which the Government describes as plastic that’s not recyclable, reusable or compostable and make a wider selection of their own-brand products available in non-plastic packaging.

What the retailers say

Tesco has acknowledged that 'for too long, packaging on consumer goods has been excessive'. It said it had already removed more than 4,000 tonnes of hard-to-recycle packaging from 800 of its own-brand products in 2019.

Meanwhile, Asda told us it had removed more than 6,500 tonnes of plastic packaging – equivalent to the weight of 600 million plastic bottles – from more than 1,000 of its own-brand lines in the past 18 months, either by removing packaging altogether or switching to an alternative material.

Sainsbury’s has a target to reduce our use of plastic packaging by 50% by 2025. The supermarket is part of the WRAP UK Plastic's Pact that promises to eliminate problematic plastics, reduce the total amount of packaging on shelves and increase recycling.

All three supermarkets have committed to halving their use of single-use plastic by 2025.

6 ways you can reduce supermarket plastic right now

Shop at a supermarket with a fresh meat and fish counter, if you can (or your local butcher and fishmonger), and take your own reusable packaging to bring food home in.

Always choose glass over plastic as it can be reused endlessly.

Buy cheese from the deli counter, if possible, and bring it home in a wax wrap, like this one.

Look for the Plastic Free Trust Mark (it guarantees there is no plastic in the packaging it appears on), which currently appears on more than 700 products, from eggs to coffee.

Find your nearest zero waste shops (where all food is bought loose, from cereal to spices and detergent) at Zero Waste Near Me.

Bottom Line: Surveyors and Mapping Technicians There will always be some need for surveyors and mapping techs, as some positions are specialized and require an advanced degree, but there are others that only require a high school diploma. The profession will see a loss of over 4,000 jobs through 2024, due to robotics and other technological advancements. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the openings that are available come from the need to replace workers who retire or leave the occupation altogether.

Parking Enforcement 2020 median pay: $ 44,870

Bottom Line: Parking Enforcement You may still see people handing out parking tickets every day, but that is a job that will likely be automated in the coming years. According to Recruiter.com, parking enforcement positions have been declining since about 2004 and have decreased by nearly 25 percent nationwide. There will be 2,360 jobs lost by 2029, which is a decrease of about 3 1/2 percent over the next few years.



However, that will not mean fewer tickets.

Prepress Technician 2020 median pay: $ 43,370

Bottom Line: Prepress Technician With print media on the decline and newspapers and magazines closing every day, prepress jobs are quickly vanishing. In 2019, the BLS announced a 5 percent decline in prepress jobs through 2029, due not only to the lack of print media, but also to automation in printing processes. Remember typesetting?

Restaurant Server 2020 median pay (waiters and waitresses): $ 27,470

Bottom Line: Restaurant Server COVID, difficult customers and low wages have made finding waitstaff difficult, but that is not the only thing that is causing a decline in restaurant workers. Robotics are also starting to play a part.



Restaurant consulting firm Aaron Allen & Associates said more than 80 percent of all positions in the industry could be automated, and of those, 37 percent of waitstaff will be affected. The company said the events of recent years have only made this more likely. ""This is just the tip of the iceberg for the industry. And while we’re not saying that every foodservice worker will be replaced with robots — nor suggesting whatsoever that the human element of service be removed — there are a lot of jobs that are ripe for disruption in the industry.""

Referee 2020 median pay (umpires, referees, and other sports officials): $ 40,140

Bottom Line: Referee Another job that's in jeopardy is refereeing. Video technology is more accurate than humans are and sports organizations like FIFA are already using it to regulate games.



As with restaurant jobs, COVID, low pay and abuse are keeping people from wanting to take on what was once an enjoyable profession. According to Business Insider, 75 percent of people leave the position within three years of taking it on.



CEO of Payball, Peter Makeover, said: ""When they don't get that sense of connection, it simply isn't worth their time.""

Herders and Wranglers 2020 median pay: $27,759

Bottom Line: Herders and Wranglers People, along with dogs and horses, have herded sheep and cattle for centuries, but these jobs may be ending sooner than you think. While there is still a need for wranglers and herders, drone technology can reach farther than humans can over more acreage. Drone technology allows farms to save money on monitoring cattle, particularly in hiring ranch hands or using helicopters.

Elevator Operator 2020 median pay: $41,000

Bottom Line: Elevator Operator Since 1950, the one job that has almost completely been made extinct is that of an elevator operator. They were essential in the days of manual elevator operation. Attendants knew how to run an elevator safely, as many users had no idea how to do it themselves. Advancement in elevator technology made them easy to operate for everyone and eliminated the need for a human attendant. While you still may see a few elevator operators here and there, today, they are mostly a novelty.

Air Traffic Controller 2020 median pay: $130,420

Bottom Line: Air Traffic Controller As you can imagine, being an air traffic controller is a highly stressful job, with no margin for error. Automation does make things safer, but the byproduct of that is fewer jobs for people.



While there will always likely be air traffic controller jobs, there is a decreased demand for them due to government budget constraints and the Next Generation Air Transportation System, which will transform air traffic control systems from radar to satellite through 2025. While the conversion will allow airports to handle more traffic, it will reduce the need for new hires at the same time.

Travel Agent 2020 median pay: $42,350 Note: Available median pay figures come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), unless otherwise noted.

Bottom Line: Travel Agent Thanks to online travel booking sites, everyone is their own personal travel agent these days. The BLS projects that the number of travel agents will decline by 12 percent over the next 10 years. But travel agents may not completely die out. According to Skift, a global travel industry intelligence provider, ""the value-add that agents can bring to the travel experience will be difficult to obviate completely, either through disintermediation or automation."" There is also an alternative career on the rise. The Occupational Outlook Handbook predicts an increase in the need for people who are experts in specific destinations or particular types of travelers. That could include corporate, luxury, study abroad or travelers over 55.

Mortgage Brokers 2020 median pay: $58,304

Bottom Line: Mortgage Brokers The number of traditional mortgage brokers dropped by 80 percent during the Great Recession, and for those who were able to keep their jobs, average salaries dropped by 30 percent. And the profession hasn’t really recovered, thanks to online brokers like Rocket Mortgage and Guaranteed Rate that make getting an online quote quick, according to Timothy G. Wiedman, a retired professor of management and human resources at Doane University in Nebraska. Add in that millennials, the home buyers of the future, have grown up doing everything online, and the outlook for mortgage brokers looks bleak at best. ""However, many of the numeric and financial skills possessed by folks who might be attracted to that profession could be utilized elsewhere in the financial services industry,"" Wiedman said. ""So by earning different professional credentials, those folks won't starve."" The BLS doesn’t track mortgage brokers and has no projections for the future of the profession.

Bookkeeper 2020 median pay (bookkeeping, accounting and auditing clerks): $41,230

Bottom Line: Bookkeeper Blame artificial intelligence for the decline of the bookkeeping profession, says Dmytro Arshynov of DMA Financial Management LLC in New York. Sites like QuickBooks Online and Receipt Bank can automatically download your bank account information and prepare a simple Form 1040 and Schedule form. With the technology constantly improving, Arshynov believes the job of bookkeeping will be eliminated within a decade and replaced with automated technologies. The BLS projects just a 1 percent drop in the category of bookkeepers, accountants and auditing clerks from 2016 to 2026, but adds that ""technological change and automation are expected to reduce demand for these workers.""

Lawyer 2020 median pay: $126,930

Bottom Line: Lawyer The world will always have lawyers, but a lot of the work they do — or used to do — is quickly being taken over by technology. Pugliano notes that a lot of the work once done by case researchers can now be done with increasingly sophisticated algorithms. His recommendation for aspiring legal eagles is to focus on specializing in non-routine human emotion intense areas, like jury selection or witness profiling. The BLS has a different point of view about lawyers, projecting an 8 percent overall increase in jobs in the field by 2026.

Broadcasters 2020 median pay (reporters, correspondents and broadcast news analysts): $49,300

Bottom Line: Broadcasters One in 10 of the nation's 33,202 radio and television announcers are expected to see their jobs disappear by 2026. Consolidation in the industry, as well as increased use of syndicated content, is fueling the decline. There's also the explosion of streaming music services. More and more listeners prefer that over their local, drive-time disc jockey. The BLS projects a 9 percent decline in the category of reporters, correspondents and broadcast news analysts, with about 4,500 total jobs going away.

Middle Managers 2021 median pay: $75,246

Bottom Line: Middle Managers The paper-pushing done by middle managers is increasingly being done by enterprise software like Oracle and Salesforce. People in those jobs, Pugliano said, should focus on revenue-producing functions like client relationships, sales or new product development. The BLS doesn’t track middle managers as an employment category and thus has no projections.

Casino Cashier 2020 median pay (gaming service workers): $27,050

Bottom Line: Casino Cashier There are plenty of opportunities in gaming as more and more states legalize gambling, but cashier is not one of them. Casinos are increasingly turning to automated machines to reduce labor costs, meaning the man or woman in the casino cage is going the way of the one-armed-bandit-style slot machines. The growth in the industry is expected to fuel demand for dealers. But there is a downside: While the number of dealers is expected to grow by 8.7 percent over the next 10 years, they earn significantly less than cashiers ($19,552 per year versus $22,970). Overall, the BLS projects a 2 percent increase by 2026 in the category of gaming service workers, which is slower than average for all occupations.

IT Support 2020 median pay: $55,510

Bottom Line: IT Support Or, as they’re also known, system and server administrators. With so much of computing becoming cloud-based, the general IT person who patrolled your office is becoming less and less relevant in today's workforce, says Nicholas C. Fiorentino, chief executive at CrediReady. The change is already happening at smaller businesses, which find it cheaper and more efficient to outsource the work. ""The good news is, it is creating the opportunity for programmers, freelancers and system administrators willing to pivot to manage their client servers remotely and profitably, and at better scale,"" Fiorentino said. The BLS take on the category: ""Employment of network and computer systems administrators is projected to grow 6 percent by 2026, about as fast as the average for all occupations.""

Financial Planners 2020 median pay: $89,330

Bottom Line: Financial Planners Tasks once performed by low-level retail financial planners are quickly being outsourced to planning software, apps, robo-advisors and investing algorithms, Pugliano says. Investopedia puts it this way: ""Robo-advisors will also likely be employed by every firm in one capacity or another. In 10 years they will likely be able to follow very sophisticated strategies that employ a measure of judgment regarding buy and sell decisions."" Pugliano does see an opening in the future. ""[An] opportunity remains for those than can implement market-timing strategies along with asset protection and risk mitigation,"" he adds.

Floral Designers 2020 median pay: $29,140

Bottom Line: Floral Designers The number of flower arrangers fell 25.6 percent between 2005 and 2015 and is projected to fall another 16.6 percent between 2015 and 2025. Blame the internet and its burgeoning business of flower delivery, as well as a push by supermarkets to bolster their floral departments and sell loose flowers directly to customers. The visual design skills used by floral designers, however, are easily transferable to the higher-paying professions of interior design and merchandise display, both of which are growing.

Postal Workers 2020 median pay: $51,150

Bottom Line: Postal Workers The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the number of postal workers, including mail carriers and clerks, will drop by 28 percent by 2026. Online bill paying and keeping in touch with friends on social media are the biggest culprits in the dreary outlook for workers in the United States Postal Service. Mail sorters will be hardest hit, with a drop of 50 percent in available jobs, according to BLS. Yes, many online retailers use the postal service to deliver packages, but that demand doesn't make up fully for other areas of decline. According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook, ""Automated sorting systems, cluster mailboxes and tight budgets will adversely affect employment."" In 2017, the postal service delivered 149 billion pieces of mail, down from 212 billion a decade earlier. And if you think Amazon will save the U.S. Postal service, think again. The company is aggressively building out its own network of delivery drivers in an effort to reduce costs and increase the availability of same-day delivery to better compete with brick-and-mortar retailers.

Photo Processor 2020 median pay: $34,720

Bottom Line: Photo Processor Digital photography continues to make job hunting tough for people who work with film. There are just 23,853 photo processors remaining in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and their ranks are expected to decrease by 19.7 percent by 2026. Fear not, shutterbugs: The need for photographers is on the increase. That profession is expected to increase by 12 percent to 155,286 jobs by 2026. Portrait and commercial photographers — the people who take photos for businesses and advertising firms — are expected to see the greatest growth over the next decade.

Data Entry Clerks 2020 median pay: $38,100

Bottom Line: Data Entry Clerks These workers are expected to be the hardest hit in an overall decline in opportunities for the broader category of office and administrative workers. Once again, we can thank — or blame — technology. Word processing, voicemail and the internet mean we end up doing a lot of the tasks that once would have been delegated to an administrative assistant. The profession had actually been in decline for several years and then saw a rapid increase in decline during the recession. The economic recovery hasn't been applied to people in this line of work: 13,200 typists lost their jobs between 2010 and 2020, and 15,900 data entry clerks lost their jobs in the same time frame.



Data entry will decline by 25 percent through 2029.

Telephone Switchboard Operators 2020 median pay: $30,723

Bottom Line: Telephone Switchboard Operators Yes, there are still a few people who work as operators, but their numbers have been declining for decades and are projected to fall another 33 percent in the next 10 years. In 2020, there were just 109,300 people working as switchboard operators. Once again, blame technology. We even heard about an office that is using Amazon’s Alexa to direct phone calls to the right recipient. Texting, voice mail and other AI-enhanced systems could make this job obsolete even sooner than projected.

Farmer 2020 median pay (farmers, ranchers and other agricultural managers): $68,090

Bottom Line: Farmers The number of agricultural workers declined 8 percent from 2010 to 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It’s not because people are eating less, but because farmers are getting more efficient, replacing workers with machinery and getting bigger yields out of smaller plots of land. Still, with the world population expected to grow by 2.3 billion people by 2050, according to the United Nations, farming will remain a widespread and necessary profession.

Fast Food Cook 2020 median pay (cooks): $27,250

Bottom Line: Fast Food Cook The promise of technology is that it will make low-paying jobs obsolete. And nothing is more symbolic of the bottom of the employment food chain than fast food cook, which is one of the few jobs in our list that require less than a high school diploma. In 2020, there were 511,400 fast food cooks working in the U.S. down 3.6 percent from 2010. The reason? Fast food is increasingly becoming an automated industry. The chains have found it cheaper to prepare food off-site and simply have employees reheat it in their stores. That was unthinkable in most fast food businesses even a decade ago, but food technology has advanced to the point where the microwaved version doesn’t lack the flavor of the cooked-on-site version.

Newspaper Reporter 2020 median pay (reporters, correspondents and broadcast news analysts): $49,300

Bottom Line: Newspaper Reporter Given that circulation has been dropping for 17 straight years and Sunday circulation of the nation’s newspapers are at their lowest levels since 1945 — when there were significantly fewer people — and it's no wonder that the people who fill the paper with news are losing their jobs. Look for nearly one in 10 reporters to lose their jobs in the next 10 years, according to BLS.

Jeweler 2020 median pay (jewelers and precious stone and metal workers): $41,900

Bottom Line: Jeweler With more and more jewelry being produced overseas, there are fewer and fewer jewelers working in the U.S. BLS projects an 11 percent decline in the number of jewelers by 2024. A 2014 report from McKinsey & Company says of the jewelry industry: ""Consequential changes are under way, both in consumer behavior as well as in the industry itself. Jewelry players can’t simply do business as usual and expect to thrive; they must be alert and responsive to important trends and developments or else risk being left behind by more agile competitors.""

Textile Machine Workers 2020 median pay (pressers, textile, garment and related materials): $26,050

Bottom Line: Textile Machine Workers Another job that requires minimal education, the low-skilled machine working is increasingly being done overseas. The decline affects setters, operators and tenders of textile knitting and weaving machines. But workers who have slightly more specialized skills, like skilled manufacturers, are seeing a slight increase in the number of opportunities available to them. An even better option? Train to be a machinist. The number of people who use lathes, milling machines and grinders to make bolts and other parts are expected to see the number of available jobs grow by 12.9 percent by 2026. The BLS projects a 7 percent decline of jobs in the pressers, textile, garment and related materials category.

Furniture Finisher 2020 median pay: $59,500

Bottom Line: Furniture Finisher These craftspeople shape, finish and refinish damaged and worn furniture. But with furniture prices constantly declining it's now often cheaper to replace than it is to repair a broken chair or table. Furniture finishers who work in production — the making of new furniture — are no better off as the process becomes automated, moved overseas or both. BLS projects the number of furniture finishers to fall 0.7 percent to 20,113 by 2026.

Door-To-Door Salespeople 2020 median pay: $36,740

Bottom Line: Door-to-Door Salespeople It really is the death of the salesman: About one in five of these jobs will be gone by 2026, according to BLS. Targeted, online advertising is far more efficient than having someone brave the elements, over-protective dogs and customers who just aren’t interested. There are, however, still plenty of opportunities for salespeople. Insurance sales agents, on average, earn close to double what door-to-door salesmen earn, and their numbers are growing: the number of people working in the field will expand by 10.6 percent to 651,215 by 2026, according to BLS.

Print Binding and Finishing Workers 2020 median pay: $ 36,430

Bottom Line: Print Binding and Finishing Workers While this job is expected to diminish at a slower pace in the coming decade than it did in the past decade, it’s still not a good time to be in the printing business. Hardest hit in the industry are the people who bind and finish books, thanks to increased automation and decreased demand. By 2026, the number of people working in binding and finishing will drop by 10.6 percent, according to BLS.

Detective 2020 median pay: $67,290

Bottom Line: Detective Surveillance cameras, spyware and DNA databanks make it easier to solve crimes, so Pugliano in his book on the coming age of robots said he sees the decline of the traditional gumshoe detective depicted for generations in mystery novels. The BLS isn't predicting a decrease in private eyes or investigators soon — in fact, the BLS projects a 7 percent increase, about average growth. Nor is the BLS predicting decreases for architects or physicians, which are the next two professions on this list. However, our experts predict these professions will have to change drastically to stay relevant. Pugliano predicts police work in the future will focus more on criminal rehabilitation and reducing recidivism, and less on solving crimes.

Routine Architect 2020 median pay: $82,320

Bottom Line: Routine Architect Jim Molinelli is a licensed architect who has taught architecture at Texas A&M University. But he doesn’t see a bright future for people looking to get into the field. To become a licensed architect requires five or six years of college and another three to five years of internships. ""All that to earn far less than the public assumes, and provide a service that is not exclusive or in demand,"" Molinelli said. Molinelli points out that a lot of the services architects provide can be provided by people who do not have licenses. ""In the corporate world, engineers can do the same tasks, and in a residential application, anyone can draw plans for new homes or for remodeling permits as long as they comply with the current codes,"" he said. ""With the ability to do it yourself, or hire other non-licensed alternatives for work on housing, the public almost never sees a value in spending to hire an architect."" The BLS predicts a 4 percent increase in jobs for architects, which is a slower-than-normal growth pace.

Worldwide, Michael Jackson‘s ‘Thriller‘ is still the most popular record of all time, with 47 million copies sold. However, in the States, the late icon’s seminal album has now been overtaken.

The Eagles‘ ‘Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975)‘, which was originally released in 1976, has been confirmed to be the best-selling album of all-time in the US, with the Recording Industry Association Of America (RIAA) reporting sales of 38 million copies. ‘Thriller’, meanwhile, is five million behind at 33 million copies.

Sales for the greatest hits record were last tallied in 2006 when it was 29 times platinum. ‘Thriller”s sales were updated last year.

In a statement, The Eagles’ Don Henley said: “We are grateful for our families, our management, our crew, the people at radio and, most of all, the loyal fans who have stuck with us through the ups and downs of 46 years. It’s been quite a ride.”

The new figures include streaming statistics. According to the RIAA’s rules, 1,500 streams of an album or 10 song downloads are equal to one album sale.

The body also confirmed The Eagles’ 1977 album ‘Hotel California‘ is now 26 times platinum, making it the third best-selling album of all time in the US.

Meanwhile, the band’s guitarist Joe Walsh joined Foo Fighters onstage in Boston last month (July 22). During the Dave Grohl-led group’s set at Fenway Park, Walsh made an appearance to perform his 1973 track ‘Rocky Mountain Way’.

August 28th. ,https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/business/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-2021/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Starbucks is bringing back the Pumpkin Spice Latte on Tuesday for those people already craving fall. It marks the earliest return date ever -- the drink is arriving a day earlier compared to last year.

Also returning is Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew , an iced-drink topped with pumpkin cream cold foam and a dusting of pumpkin spice that Starbucks launched in 2019. The two fall-themed drinks are in addition to two seasonal bakery items: a pumpkin scone and a pumpkin cream cheese muffin.

The PSL, as it's often referred to, has been a popular item on Starbucks' menu for nearly two decades sparking joy and excitement among its loyal fan base. Starbucks has sold more than 500 million PSLs since the drink's introduction in 2003.

Although the drink hit Starbucks' menu earlier than previous years, Dunkin' already beat its competition to the punch.

Mum branded 'disgusting' after disclosing shower habit - which she thought was completely normal

It can be completely baffling when we discover something we've done for years, something we assumed everyone did, isn't actually 'normal'.

There's always that awkward moment when you drop it into conversation and everyone stares at you as if you've completely lost the plot.

One mum found herself in this position when she was explaining something she does in the shower to her husband.

He dubbed it 'disgusting', but she's convinced everyone does it.

And it turns out they're not the only ones who can't agree on it - and her admission has started a huge debate online.

The woman shared her story on Mumsnet to see what other parents thought.

She wrote: ""Dh [darling husband] thinks it's disgusting. I think it's fine.

""The warm water makes me need a wee and I'm not going to get out, soak the floor, dry off and all that.

""It's environmentally friendly as less toilet flushing.

""The water washes the wee away and it's only wee.

""I thought everyone did it occasionally.""

Other parents were horrified by her admission.

One wrote: ""Why can't you just go before you get in the shower?? Sorry but I think it is disgusting!""

Another added: ""Nope. Grim behaviour. I wouldn't be impressed if my dh did it.""

One woman replied: ""I can always tell when someone is a shower p*****. Their shower cubicle and bathroom tends to stink of piss in the same way a urinal does (sorry, but it does.) The only place any pee should be going is down a toilet.""

But some didn't see what the issue is, and admitted they also do it.

One said: ""I can't really see what's actually disgusting about it, it's only wee, it washes away immediately and then you have a wash so no danger (shock horrible) of any traces of urine left on your body!""

Another replied: ""Peeing in the shower is eco friendly. Our loo uses 10 litres of water for a flush, that’s 5 days drinking water. As for it being disgusting, in what way? How? How can your own wee bring washed down the drain be disgusting.""

This Sneaky Trick Will Earn You More Passport Stamps

© Jaku Arias

Alice Johnston Food Editor 2 February 2018 View

They’re a time-honoured souvenir of your travels, and a prized method of proving that you’ve seen the world.

But passport stamps can be elusive to acquire. Some countries such as Israel and Macau don’t issue them any more, instead providing visitors with a landing slip. And if you’re an EU citizen travelling in Europe, the Schengen agreement means free movement between countries without the need for passport checks.

Some people love getting passport stamps, using the pages of their passport as a way of storing memories.

Wish your passport could be as stamped as this? Read on | © rawpixel.com / Shutterstock

So if you’re a traveller who’s keen to get stamped proof that you’ve been to a certain country and are sick of seeing your unstamped passport slide back towards you at immigration desks, what do you do?

It’s so simple, you won’t believe you haven’t thought of it before: just ask for one.

Nicely, of course. Immigration officers aren’t people you want to annoy. If the queue through security is huge and slow-moving, if the officials are visibly stressed or there’s a larger than normal police presence or political tension, hold your horses and don’t make a fuss.

If everything is running like clockwork, however, you have absolutely nothing to lose by asking politely for an official stamp. More often than not, the officer will be happy to give you one and you’ll have an extra memory to take away from your travels.

It can even work in places where there isn’t immigration. If you’re on a cruise ship, for instance, it’s perfectly possible to track down the immigration officer in a port and ask them to give you a stamp, even though the ship will already have been cleared for docking.

There are a few things to bear in mind. Technically you’re only supposed to have official stamps in your passport, so it’s probably best to turn down the non-legitimate, touristy stamps you can pick up at places like Checkpoint Charlie. While it’s likely no trouble will come from them, there’s a possibility that if you’re travelling somewhere with strict entry requirements such as China they could prompt suspicious questions about the legitimacy of your documents.

You should also be wary about having enough blank space in your passport. Some visas need double spreads or full blank pages for visas or stamps, so if an official can’t find enough space that could cause problems. It might also mean replacing your passport sooner than you usually would as the pages will be filled faster, which can be expensive.",This Sneaky Trick Will Earn You More Passport Stamps
It's a rock. ,https://bgr.com/science/mars-foreign-object-curiosity-inspection/,"Despite what so many people would love to believe, NASA hasn’t discovered any evidence of past or present intelligent life on Mars. So, when the Curiosity rover stumbled upon what appeared to be a very suspicious chunk of something on the Red Planet’s surface, they were not only surprised but also a little bit worried.

The thin fragment was suspicious enough to warrant its own name, with NASA’s Curiosity rover team calling it the “Pettegrove Point Foreign Object Debris,” named for the location where it was discovered. With no idea what it was or where it came from, the rover’s handlers began to worry that it might actually be a chunk of the rover itself, suggesting some unseen damage or other issue with the robot. Thankfully, those concerns seem to have been unfounded.

In a new update from NASA the object has now been identified as a natural chunk of rock rather than a piece of any manmade craft or vehicle. The team analyzed the bizarre object with a tool called the ChemCam RMI. The instrument uses a laser to sniff out the makeup of anything it’s pointed at, and the results for this particular piece of debris revealed that it’s actually just a very thin piece of rock.

NASA describes the inspection thusly:

The planning day began with an interesting result from the previous plan’s ChemCam RMI analysis of a target that was referred to as “Pettegrove Point Foreign Object Debris” (PPFOD), and speculated to be a piece of spacecraft debris. In fact it was found to be a very thin flake of rock, so we can all rest easy tonight – Curiosity has not begun to shed its skin!

How this particularly thin sliver of rock got to where it is — and why it seems to be a different color than the surrounding sand and debris — remains unexplained, but at least the rover isn’t falling apart.",NASA finally figured out what this ‘foreign object’ on Mars actually is
It's a whale. ,https://www.foxnews.com/science/mysterious-fur-covered-sea-monster-washes-up-on-beach-could-it-be-some-ancient-creature,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Is it the remains of a woolly mammoth — or a decaying whale? Those were the questions on beachgoers' minds as they gathered around a giant, hairy sea creature that was beached in Siberia.

The mysterious creature, which doesn't appear to have a prominent face with eyes, recently washed up from the Bering Sea.

""The most interesting thing to me is that the creature is covered with tubular fur. Could it be some ancient creature?"" local Svetlana Dyadenko asked, according to The Siberian Times. ""I wish scientists could inspect this enigma that [the] ocean threw at us.""

MYSTERIOUS 20-FOOT SEA CREATURE COVERED IN SHAGGY HAIR WASHES UP ON PHILIPPINES BEACH

The creature is about three times as big as an average man and some reported seeing at least one tentacle, prompting some to question whether it was a huge octopus. The carcass had a pungent odor.

Marine biologist Sergei Kornev, who works at the Russian Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (VNIRO), told the newspaper the ""globster"" was most likely a piece of a whale that had been dead for a while.

""Under the influence of the sea, time and various animals, from the smallest to the largest, a whale often takes on bizarre forms,"" he explained. ""This is only a part of a whale, not a whole one.""

It's currently unclear whether researchers will take tissue or DNA samples from the creature.

This isn't the first time a shaggy-haired ""monster"" has been spotted on a beach.

A similar creature washed up on a Philippines beach in May, causing chaos in the San Antonio area. A video of the massive greyish white creature was posted to YouTube, showing two men with ropes working together to pull the monster out of the water.

Booze. ,https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/weed-or-booze-scientists-finally-settle-which-is-worse-for-your-brain/,"Potheads and boozehounds have been duking it out for ages, and scientists have finally settled the age-old debate of whether marijuana or alcohol use is worse.

Drum roll, please.

Sorry boozers. It turns out, marijuana may not be as damaging to the brain as previously thought.

Researchers examined the brains of more than 1,000 participants of varying ages by looking at neurological imaging data from MRI scans. Specifically, they used the data to examine the types of tissues that make up the brain: gray and white matter. Gray matter includes cell bodies that, among other things, enable functionality, while white matter allows everything to communicate. A loss of either would mean the brain isn’t working properly.

The team found that marijuana and cannabinoid products did not have long-term effects.

Alcohol, on the other hand, was significantly associated with a decrease in gray matter size and white matter integrity, especially in adults with decades of exposure. The findings are published in the journal Addiction.

Yes, booze brain is a thing. The negative impacts of alcohol on the brain have been known for years, and it was assumed cannabinoids were damaging to long-term brain health as well because of their immediate psychoactive effects.

""With alcohol, we’ve known it’s bad for the brain for decades,"" said co-author of the study Kent Hutchison in a statement. ""But for cannabis, we know so little.”

A lot of past research studying the negative effects of marijuana came up with differing results said Hutchison, who is a professor of behavioral neuroscience at the University of Colorado (CU) Boulder.

""The point is that there’s no consistency across all of these studies in terms of the actual brain structures,” he said.

Don’t go running to the nearest dispensary just yet. Researchers say this doesn’t mean pot is better for you or that the study proves any health benefit of toking up. It just means the impacts of lighting up might be less than what was previously believed.

""Particularly with marijuana use, there is still so much that we don't know about how it impacts the brain,"" said Rachel Thayer, a graduate student in clinical psychology at CU Boulder and the lead author of the study. ""Research is still very limited in terms of whether marijuana use is harmful, or beneficial, to the brain.""

The researchers say the study could help to better inform potential alternative pain treatments in the face of the ongoing opioid epidemic.",Weed Or Booze? Scientists Finally Settle Which Is Worse For Your Brain

For example, you can see what everyone else in the lift is doing – lift mirrors have played a role in spotting theft and even predicting an assault. In Japan – which is thought to be where the lift mirror was first introduced – the purpose is accessibility. Platform lifts can make buildings accessible for wheelchair users where stairs present an obstacle. However, the size of the lift may mean that there is no space for a wheel chair user to turn around inside it. The placement of mirrors helps someone in a wheelchair to back in or out of the lift safely without having to turn.

Black turtlenecks. ,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/elon-musk-absolutely-hated-this-one-thing-about-steve-jobs,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

When you are a billionaire tech mogul it’s hard to not be compared to those that came before.

Take Tesla chief executive Elon Musk for example.

The philanthropist often receives parallels between his life and that of the fictional Marvel character Tony Stark.

And then there is the suggestion that he is the second coming of Steve Jobs.

Although Musk is not overly thrilled by either comparison, the latter is more concerning.

Not because he doesn’t respect the Apple founder’s legacy — rather his fashion sense.

In a revealing interview with Rolling Stone published Wednesday, Musk talked about a time he was asked to wear a black turtleneck, which was the famous trademark of Jobs, during a photoshoot.

He was not impressed.

“If I was dying and I had a turtleneck on, with my last dying breath, I would take the turtleneck off and try to throw it as far away from my body as possible,” he explained.

Musk didn’t dwell on the fashion choices of millionaires for too long, with the interview quickly turning to his concerns for the dangers of artificial intelligence.

“Climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI,” he said. “I keep telling people this.”

It wasn’t all doom and gloom, with Musk giving insight into what drives him.

“I try to do useful things,” he explained. “That’s a nice aspiration. And useful means it is of value to the rest of society. Are they useful things that work and make people’s lives better, make the future seem better, and actually are better, too? I think we should try to make the future better.”

And what does Musk view as better?

“It would be better if we mitigated the effects of global warming and had cleaner air in our cities and weren’t drilling for vast amounts of coal, oil and gas in parts of the world that are problematic and will run out anyway,” he said.

“And if we were a multiplanetary species, that would reduce the possibility of some single event, man-made or natural, taking out civilisation as we know it, as it did the dinosaurs.

“There have been five mass-extinction events in the fossil record. People have no comprehension of these things. Unless you’re a cockroach or a mushroom — or a sponge — you’re f***ed.”

Dinner for the 29-year-old mother of two consisted of Taco Bell takeout, followed by a few slices of cake. She also had a very unhealthy peanut butter addiction.

Here she was at her heaviest.

In 2006, she had gastric bypass surgery. But she still wasn't able to lose the weight.

Amy downloaded a calorie-counting app to her phone. After learning she was eating more than 4,000 calories a day, she decided to make a change.

'Before I never took the time to realise what I was actually eating, since understanding the nutritional content of what's going into my body my diet's drastically changed,"" Amy explained.

She started exercising and eating well. That meant no more peanut butter by the spoonfuls and unhealthy snacks. ""'I'd easily eat three large spoonfuls of peanut butter at a time, then I'd have snacks with lots of peanut butter in them too,"" she said.

In the end, she ended up dropping over 200 pounds. Amy has documented her whole journey on her Instagram.

""Now, since losing weight I feel really confident, I can hang out with my friends and feel like I can go to more places with my children,'"" Amy said.

People are deliberately hurting their pets to get painkillers. ,https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/people-might-be-hurting-their-pets-to-get-opioids-according-to-vets/,"The opioid crisis in America continues to be deadly causing medical practitioners to wonder whether they have been doing enough to counter this worrying epidemic. But it appears this concern is also shared by veterinarians.

In a recent survey, Colorado vets expressed concern that some of their clients might be deliberately hurting their pets in a bid to get prescription painkillers. The survey was conducted by the Center for Health, Work & Environment at the Colorado School of Public Health at CU Anschutz and a local veterinary association.

Of the 189 vets interviewed, 13 percent reported having a client that had either injured or made a pet sick intentionally, or at least made them appear to be unwell. Almost 45 percent said they knew a pet owner or member of their staff with an opioid addiction, and 12 percent were aware of members of staff either diverting opioids or abusing them. These findings are reported in an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health.

""The role veterinarians play in helping reduce opioid abuse hasn't been thoroughly examined,"" Lili Tenney, one of the lead investigators of the survey and the deputy director of the Center for Health, Work & Environment, said in a statement. ""Our results indicate that we should be paying more attention to how opioid abusers are seeking their drugs – including through veterinary clinics. We want to see health people and healthy pets.""

The most common drug targeted is tramadol, a painkiller that can be used to treat both humans and animals, but vets can stock, carry, prescribe, and administer a variety of opioids in their clinics. It is important that any misuse is addressed as quickly as possible as this will help not just humans but pets as well.

While the survey focused on Colorado, it is likely that the issue is widespread across the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that prescription medication overdose is the leading cause of the death in people below the age of 50. Around 115 people die in the United States every day due to opioid addiction.",Disturbing New Method Of Obtaining Drugs Has Vets Worried
Beef fat flavoring in oil. ,https://www.rd.com/article/mcdonalds-fries-ingredients/,"There's one ingredient in McDonald's fries that makes them so dang addictive—and it's not the salt. Find out what really punches up their flavor.

There are matchstick fries and steak fries; crinkle-cut fries and waffle fries; cheese fries and sweet potato fries. But among all the rest, McDonald’s french fries are an old standby. There’s something about the flavor that we just can’t stop eating—similar to how we can’t seem to resist McDonald’s Coke, Sprite, or chicken nuggets.

And no, it’s not just in your head that these fast-food fries are one of the most addictive foods. One secret ingredient keeps you coming back for more. But before we reveal it, let’s take a step back and talk about the food facts surrounding the ingredients in McDonald’s fries ingredients.

What are McDonald’s french fries made of?

Fresh potatoes are washed, peeled, cut, and blanched to make McDonald’s fries, according to a video from the company. The factory they’re made in also adds chemicals to keep the potatoes a uniform light yellow color (but no, that’s not behind their addictive flavor). After that, the cut potatoes are fried for less than a minute before getting frozen and sent to McDonald’s locations. At the restaurant, those frozen strips are cooked in oil and salt before landing on your tray in that red box. Learn the trick for getting fresh french fries every single time.

How many ingredients are in McDonald’s french fries?

Who hasn’t been curious about McDonald’s fries ingredients? According to McDonald’s, their signature fries are made with 10 ingredients:

Potatoes

Vegetable oil

Canola oil

Corn oil

Soybean oil

Hydrogenated soybean oil

Natural beef flavor (which contains wheat and milk derivatives)

Dextrose

Sodium acid pyrophosphate

Salt

What makes McDonald’s french fries taste so good?

It all started in the 1950s when the shortening company that gave McDonald’s vegetable oil couldn’t afford the equipment needed to hydrogenate the oil, which would extend its shelf life. So the supplier gave a blend of oil and beef fat instead, according to NPR.

Over time, McDonald’s and other fast-food joints made the beef fat part of their signature fry flavors. But in the 1980s, fast-food restaurants took the ingredient out when health advocates criticized how much “bad” saturated fat it added.

McDonald’s wanted to keep its signature beefy flavor but without the beef fat itself, so it came up with a solution. Now the fast-food chain adds “natural beef flavor” to its vegetable oil to give its fries their irresistibly meaty taste.

Are McDonald’s french fries vegan?

In the United States, McDonald’s french fries are not vegan, because the natural beef flavor is made with milk derivatives. However, if you’re across the pond in the United Kingdom, the fries (or “chips” as they’re called in the UK) are vegan since they’re not made with that beef flavor or coated in any animal substances.

"We're in a ""snow globe"" so there's a dome that keeps us from falling off. ",https://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/flatearther-finally-explains-why-nobody-has-fallen-off-the-edge/,"Flat-Earthers are not known for their logic. They're generally known for their willingness to ignore the facts, and their dank memes.

When it comes to explaining the logical flaws in their arguments, however, they tend to fall a little, well, flat. If you ignore all the planetary evidence that points to the Earth being round, the countless experiments you can do at home, or even the photos taken from space, there's still one major flaw in their argument that needs explaining.

Basically, if the world is flat, why on Earth is the Internet not filled with news stories about people falling off the edge of it to their deaths?

Pretty dank meme there, Flatty.

Well, now one prominent flat-Earther, Connor Murphy, has revealed why this doesn't happen. He's concluded the Earth is in fact round. Just kidding. Murphy has concluded that there is no edge at all.

""Fall off into what, do you know what I’m saying? There’s no edge. This is a misconception,"" Murphy told Unilad.

""The way we see it is it’s an enclosed system. There’s water above, there’s the firmament – or the dome – and there’s water above it and water below it and there’s no leaving it, there’s no anti-gravity allowing us to float around and find other Suns and stuff.""

So nobody falls off the edge because we're all in a massive snow globe. Pretty convincing stuff.

""His widow told IFLScience that she won't mourn for someone who would do something so idiotic"". IFLScience.

In the interview, Murphy went on to accuse NASA of covering up that the Earth was flat in order to make more money, before contradicting his earlier view that we don't fall off because we're in a dome.

""Basically if you can imagine the globe squashed down with Antarctica instead of being its own continent, being the perimeter around the side. So a lot of people say that’s an ice wall. It’s more like a shelf or cliff.""

So the reason why we don't fall off is because of the big ice wall (here be dragons?), and if you get past that you hit the dome. Makes you feel so safe.",Flat-Earther Finally Explains Why Nobody Has Fallen Off The Edge
When you zoom out you see a 3D sphere instead of a flat Mercator Projection. ,https://www.iflscience.com/space/is-google-maps-taking-a-shot-at-flatearthers-with-its-latest-upgrade/,"Google has made a small change to their Google Maps program that might ruffle a few flat-Earther feathers.

Previously, if you zoomed out far enough, you would see a map of the Earth known as the Mercator Projection, but more on that later. Essentially, it made the blue planet look about as flat as it would on the page of an Atlas.

Now, zoom out and you will see a glorious 3D sphere. Google Maps has become a digital globe you can rotate and spin to your heart's delight – and we imagine some flat-Earthers will be fuming.

The decision was announced with little fuss in a tweet last week.

-

So, back to the Mercator Projection. It was named after its creator, Gerardus Mercator. He was a Flemish geographer and cartographer who lived 450 years ago, back when women wore lead makeup, Australia was yet to be ""discovered"" by the Europeans, and Shakespeare was still in diapers (figuratively-speaking, at least).

The problem is that the projection gives a very distorted view of the world, making countries closer to the poles appear far larger than they are in reality and those closer to the equator much smaller.

This wasn't intentional or done with any animosity towards equator-sitting countries like Brazil and Uganda, but because mathematically it made sense and it served its purpose as a navigational tool. It does, however, mean that Sweden looks the same size as Mexico and Greenland looks bigger than Mexico – neither of which is true. (As you can see for yourself on this tool here.)

To be fair to Mercator, his map was completed in 1569. That is 388 years before the first satellite was launched into space and decades before even the telescope was invented. Yet, it is now 2018 and the continued use of the map despite its many and obvious flaws is facing heavy criticism.

Google responded to this criticism themselves in 2009. According to the Google Maps & Earth Help Forum, the first launch did not use the Mercator Projection but the framework was later adopted to help ""preserve angles"" and enable close-ups. This is, after all, the primary function of the program.

We're not sure why they have changed their mind now but they have, and Google Maps’ globe mode will work on desktop browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Eagle. It does not (yet) work on mobile browsers.",Google Map's Latest Update Is Sure To Annoy Flat-Earthers

Prabhu Bhatara, a taxi driver from Papadahandi in the Nabarangpur district of Odisha, India was mauled to death after approaching the animal, reports The Independent.

He stopped his SUV to go to the toilet, before then spotting the animal. While his passengers told him not to approach it, he then went too close while trying to take a picture and was attacked.

“A stray dog tried to fight with the bear but was unable to save the man,” according to the Metro. “Forest officials eventually tranquilized the bear so that they could get to his body.”

Locals had said the bear was getting a drink from a pond when the taxi driver approached. “Bhatara died on the spot,” Forest ranger Dhanurjaya Mohapatra said. ""The bear is being treated for its injuries.”

There is a video of the incident is below. Warning, some may find the footage distressing.

Approaching animals in this way is always, always a bad idea. Bears are extremely unpredictable and, if threatened, can be prone to attacking.

""While [seeing a bear] is an exciting moment, it is important to remember that bears in national parks are wild and can be dangerous,"" the National Park Service in the US notes. ""Their behavior is sometimes unpredictable. Although rare, attacks on humans have occurred, inflicting serious injuries and death.""

Despite maybe looking approachable, they are still wild animals. In India, it's estimated that one person dies every day from an attack by a wild animal.

The Google Maps Street View camera captured the incident while driving down a residential road. Taking the photo with the mounted camera, a young man was spotted on the pavement. Dressed in a grey jumper and jeans, he seemed to make himself very comfortable by taking off his shoes. He was spotted lounging on a white sofa, perhaps for a snooze. Down by his side was a drawstring bag with a large water bottle.

It isn’t clear if he wanted to sleep in earnest or was playing up to the camera. Yet as the Street View car continued to drive down the road, the man made no effort to get up. He appeared to be very comfortable on the white seating, which was devoid of dirt or grime. The sofa could not have been there long, with the man making the most of the relaxing moment. There are no other passersby around so their reaction was not caught in regards to the man resting.

Probably not. ,https://thegww.com/pirates-of-the-caribbean-6-in-the-works-but-will-disney-finally-remove-johnny-depp-from-the-franchise/,"While people are currently focused on what will happen with Guardians of The Galaxy 3 after the firing of James Gunn, there is another project at Walt Disney Studios that might have some issues moving forward and that is Pirates of The Caribbean 6.

We now hear progress has been made and it might actually end up happening with director Joachim Rønning expected to return (currently shooting Disney’s Maleficent 2). A script is seemingly being worked on by writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and Jeff Nathanson with production designer Nigel Phelps said to be returning as well.

Considering Joachim is busy with Maleficent 2 there is a good chance filming won’t be taking place until after that releases in late May 2020 and we assume could land a release in 2021-2022.

Now comes the big question, post-James Gunn will Disney tolerate the return of Johnny Depp in a sixth film?

Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seemingly doesn’t see any issues with Depp, stating last year to DigitalSpy that he didn’t see the franchise continuing without Depp. At the end of the day it’s a Disney property and they can do what they’d like with it. What else would Jerry say during the promotional tour?

“I just don’t see it,” says producer Jerry Bruckheimer, writing off any plans for future instalments without Captain Jack (as well as the ridiculous idea of anyone other than Depp ever playing him).

“The secret to any successful franchise is picking talented people, and Johnny is absolutely key to the success of Pirates. He’s such a unique character, such an endearing character, and such an irreverent character all in one.”

That seems to be harder and harder to swallow, even more so with fresh reports of Depp punching a crew member on his latest film leading to a lawsuit and a bizarre interview only cementing his erratic behaviour (not excluding previous domestic abuse allegations). It does seem like a good time for Walt Disney Studios to just wash their hands of him and just move forward with the franchise as weird as that sounds with Depp being the face of it.

It’s really hard to ignore that elephant in the room business-wise concerning Depp’s involvement with Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and the big dip the latest film took at the box office potentially due to his participation. Dead Men ended up earning globally $795 million on a budget of $230 million versus the previous installment On Stranger Tides earning a whopping $1.045 billion on a budget of $250 million, Tides being the second biggest box office earner in the franchise.

From a financial standpoint, they might not want to keep him around just because of that huge $250 million drop.

Does Disney recast the role of Jack Sparrow, create an entirely new character or do they just focus on existing pirates?

The franchise has a bunch of existing characters such as Orlando Bloom’s Will Turner and his son Henry played by Brenton Thwaites, who could step in. There’s also Barbossa’s daughter Carina played by Kaya Scodelario,

That’s unless they create a new character and possibly seek a new actor entirely, I do have some of my own suggestions if the studio does look to replace Depp with another actor.

I wouldn’t be against seeing Sasha Baron Cohen takeover the lead, either him playing a member of the Sparrow family or an entirely new pirate lead. He already has a connection with the studio playing a big role in Alice In Wonderland: Through The Looking Glass. He also isn’t opposed to period films with roles in Hugo, Les Miserables, and Sweeney Todd.

Robert Downey Jr. seemingly might be ending his tenure at Marvel Studios or at the very least slowing down how many movies he appears in. He’s not opposed to using a British accent and could make for a charismatic replacement. Not too mention that Disney I’m sure will want to stay in business with Robert in the foreseeable future.

Emily Blunt has been quite the busy bee over at Disney with Into The Woods, Mary Poppins Returns and Jungle Cruise, she could make for an interesting pick as Disney does seem open to female protagonists and the franchise having a new female pirate at the helm could smooth things over with wary audiences. She’s proven her self multiple times with action roles like Sicario and Edge of Tomorrow that she can handle pretty much any type of genre, even comedy.

The ball is ultimately in Disney’s court but it’s going to be hard for them to take a stand like with James Gunn and keep employing actors like Johnny Depp (who has actual allegations of assault), it will be completely hypocritical and lead to a PR nightmare. I guess we’ll have to wait and see.",‘Pirates of The Caribbean 6’ In The Works But Will Disney Finally Remove Johnny Depp From The Franchise?

Keith Urban; he was a little short on cash. ,https://meaww.com/woman-helps-man-with-cash-finds-out-hes-keith-urban,"A New Jersey woman helped out a man last Friday who was short on cash and paid his food bill at a gas station. Sounds like such a kind act, no? Wait until you hear what happened next!

The woman, identified as Ruth Reed, got the shock of her life when she realized that the man she had just helped is a star worth an estimated $75 million, according to reports.

Little did she know that the man was, in fact, the popular country music star — Keith Urban, who she said she met at a Medford Wawa before his concert on Friday night in Camden, New Jersey.

Reed, who is a substitute teacher, said that she had made a resolution to help the customers at Wawa at least once a week and it was at the eatery that she found out the man in front of her was short on a few dollars and she decided to pitch in, the Daily Mail reported.

The woman said that the star thanked her and introduced himself, saying his name was Keith. When the woman told him that he looked very similar to Keith Urban, he then revealed that he was, in fact, the music star.

Reed then asked him where his wife Nicole Kidman was as the New Zealander was with some other woman. Then the star introduced the woman with her as his sister, reports state.

Despite Keith confirming his identity, Reed did not believe him, so she asked his bodyguard to re-confirm whether it was really him.

Reed got reassured after bodyguard confirmed Keith's identity.

""It was then I realized what an idiot I was,"" the grandmother said, according to reports.

Urban, who has lived most of his life in Australia, is reportedly touring the United States as part of his Graffiti U tour.

Urban then reportedly offered to take a picture with the teacher in the parking lot, and Reed later posted the picture on Facebook. She recounted her meeting with the celebrity, and captioned it as ""another Ruth Reed moment.""","Big-hearted woman helps man short on cash to pay for his food, but has no clue who he really is"

Alibaba is one of the most prominent Chinese technology names around the world and has a market value of about $463 billion. So far this year, its stock price has risen about 3.6 percent with shares hitting highs in June. If you invested in Alibaba four years ago when it made headlines as the then-biggest initial public offering ever, you'd have made some decent returns. According to CNBC calculations, a $1,000 investment made at the closing price on Sept. 19, 2014 would be worth about $1,902.43 as of Monday, Aug. 6. That is approximately a 90.24 percent jump in value from the closing price on the first day of trading. Alibaba doesn't pay any dividends.

Consumer-facing technology companies have been on a roll over the last few years due to rapid technology developments and a growing number of people using their services. For example, Facebook reported it has 2.23 billion monthly active users as of June 30, 2018. Apple, which boasts a prominent hardware business that makes smartphones, computers and tablets, reached a historic $1 trillion market value milestone last week. In comparison, a $1,000 investment into Amazon over the same period would have been worth about $5,576.93 on Monday. Meanwhile, a similar investment into Apple would be worth $2,070.82 as of Monday. (If you made a decade-long investment in the iPhone-maker, however, it would be worth more than $9,222.50 as of last week.)

Fruits and vegetables are an essential part of a healthy diet, providing ample vitamins, minerals, and filling fiber without tons of calories, saturated fat, or sodium. Unfortunately, many people are making a major mistake with their fruits and veggies that could be putting them at risk for serious illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Before you find yourself laid up in bed with a serious illness, read on to discover how to avoid this critical error.

Nerve compression from an awkward sleeping position. ,https://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11854588/numb-arm-sleep,"Waking up in the middle of the night to discover one of your arms has lost all feeling is frightening.

At first, the limb is limp and flops around like a useless bag of bone before coming back to life with a flood of ""pins and needles"" sensations.

When this happened to me as a kid, I panicked, thinking I'd done something horrible to my body, anxious that I'd never be able to move my arm again. But the feeling in my arm always came back.

This phenomenon is really common, James Dyck, a neurology researcher with the Mayo Clinic, told me in 2016. And it's actually a cool example of how the body can protect itself even during the paralysis of sleep.

Dyck explained there's a common misconception that pins and needles and numbness are caused by a lack of blood flow to the nerves. ""The more likely thing is nerve compression — nerves are being pushed on and squashed, and that causes these symptoms,"" he says. (It’s also true that numbness in the arm can also be a symptom of something more serious, like a heart attack.)

You have several nerves in your arm. Each serves a vital function.

The axillary nerve lifts the arm at the shoulder.

The musculocutaneous nerve bends the elbow.

The radial nerve straightens out the arm and lifts your wrist and fingers.

The ulnar nerve spreads your fingers.

Although Dyck says the exact physiology isn't completely understood, the effect of compressing any of these nerves in sleep — when you sleep on top of your arm or pin it underneath a partner — is like stepping on a garden hose. The information that flows from your extremities back to your brain is temporarily disrupted.

So why does it feel paralyzed upon waking?

Dyck suggests two reasons.

1) It is actually, temporarily, paralyzed. During REM sleep, the brain sends a signal to cause a body-wide paralysis. The purpose of this is to keep you from acting out dreams (which occur during REM). But if you wake up during one of these phases, you can be conscious before your fully regain control of your limbs. This is called sleep paralysis, and it can be a frightening situation. You're stuck somewhere in between dreaming and wakefulness, and you can't move.

2) The nerve compression has led to a temporary paralysis (perhaps because you got stuck in a compressed position during REM).

Compressing nerves can damage them. The good thing is that the body will naturally wake up as a protection mechanism when a nerve has been compressed too long. After you wake and relieve the pressure, the nerves will quickly come back online, usually first with a pins-and-needles feeling.

""The nerve structures, as they recover, tend to be irritable for a period of time,"" the University of Rochester Medical Center explains. ""That’s because the nerves are firing spontaneously. Most of the time, the feeling of pins and needles is a good sign. It is a temporary phase that means nerves are coming back to life.""

Someone who falls asleep on a limb is unlikely to do major damage to the nerves, Dyck says. But there are some cases when compressed nerves can become a greater problem.

One such case is called ""Saturday night palsy,"" when a person falls asleep compressing a nerve while drunk. The alcohol impairs your body's ability to wake you up and protect your nerves.

""If you’re passed out drunk, you won’t move your arm,"" Dyck says. And when you wake up the next day, you can't extend your wrist and you can’t extend your fingers."" That might last longer than a few moments (perhaps even a few days or months) as the nerve has to repair its protective coating.

And then there's hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to nerve compression injuries. They might want to be extra careful not to fall asleep on a limb or even cross their leg to avoid nerve compression. (Carpal tunnel may also cause tingling or numbness in limbs at night.)

Again, for most people who wake up to a dead limb, it's just a temporary annoyance. And it ""probably takes less time [to recover] than you think it does, because you’re freaking out about it,"" Dyck says.

Late sleeper? Blame your genes.","Ever wake up to a numb, dead arm? Here’s what’s happening."
"""...charge that person for the salary of every emergency responder who’s on the scene because of it,” ",https://sgtcheryldorsey.com/retired-la-police-officer-has-the-perfect-solution-to-stop-nosy-paranoid-white-people-from-calling-cops-on-innocent-blacks/,"In addition to traumatizing people with unnecessary police encounters, calling 911 when you see a black person do something in public (or in private) is a monumental waste of time and resources for first responders.

In the past year, there have been multiple high-profile incidents of white people getting caught threatening to call the cops on people of color for engaging in everyday, normal activities: swimming in a pool ; eating lunch ; using food stamps; feeding the homeless, to name just a few recent examples.

Retired Sgt. Cheryl Dorsey—who worked for the LAPD for 20 years—tells Raw Story there’s a simple solution.

“There are policies in place for people who abuse 911. Let’s say someone goes fishing on a lake, even though there’s a sign that says ‘No fishing on the lake,’ and they get stuck needing a SEAL team to rescue them or whatever. They charge you for resources.”

The same can be true for calling the authorities on people who are not breaking the law.

“Let’s say somebody calls you and you suspect it’s BS … charge that person for the salary of every emergency responder who’s on the scene because of it,” Dorsey said.

She recalls that back during her time on the force, the LAPD would get daily phone calls from what they jokingly referred to as “the Laser Lady.”

“She’d call everyday. She wanted someone to adjust the tin foil on her head! It was kind of funny.”

But there’s nothing funny about the racism that would prompt someone to call the police on a black person doing nothing wrong.

“Police department resources are minimal. Cops don’t have time to go to the scene because there are some black people having a BBQ in a park.”

“It’s such a no brainer. Many people live paycheck to paycheck. If you had to pay the salaries of four cops responding to the scene and a sergeant… well you’d probably think twice.”",Retired LA police officer has the perfect solution to stop nosy paranoid white people from calling cops on innocent blacks
Bacteria. ,https://www.comicsands.com/why-dogs-paws-smell-fritos-2591884469.html,"Ever caught a good whiff of your dog's paw as it affectionately brushed across your face? Did it smell familiar?

If you said, ""Actually, my Bruno's paw smells like corn chips,"" you're not alone. Many dog owners described the aroma from their dog's paws smelling strangely similar to that of Fritos or even corn tortillas – and there's a reason for it.

People want answers.







Giphy









The Kansas City Star calls the phenomenon, ""Fritos Paws,"" or ""Fritos Feet.""

Dog blogger Beth Meadow wrote an entry for DogTime.com website, saying that many owners love the smell of their furry friend's feet.

This may or may not be a surprise to you, fellow dog owner and dog feet lover. I for one don't understand it. Perhaps because I know all too well what my dogs are walking through every day.













Well-groomed and clean dogs aren't exempt from emitting the smell of Fritos.























The Dogington Post weighed in on the naturally produced odor from a dog, but warned owners may want to take paws (see what we did there?) before getting their noses in contact with their pets' feet.

The culprit for the smell has everything to do with bacteria.

But dog's feet, trampling through the grass and dirt, being licked, with moist folds of skin and fur between the toe pads, are breeding grounds for bacteria and yeast.













The odor-causing microorganisms are very similar to what gives us BO. For dogs, yeast or the bacterium Proteus, which is characteristic of the corn chip smell, could be a causing factor.

Bacterium Pseudomonas could also be contributing to the smell typically associated with what ours noses interpret as a popcorn scent.



While an intense aroma of Fritos Paws is nothing to be overly concerned about, signs like seeing your dog constantly licking its paws and a noticeable inflammation between its toes could be signs of an infection, in which case a trip to the vet might be in order.

The Huffington Post clarified what to look for specifically.

By the way: It's a normal behavior for dogs to lick their paws — it's how they self-clean and remember where they've been throughout the day. Excessive is the keyword.

Now that the pseudo-mystery is solved, one Twitter user cautiously inquired about actual Fritos, and I don't think we want to know the answer.

She was happy to hear from him and only lived 1 hour away. ,https://www.boredpanda.com/adopted-man-biological-parents-davismemevoter/,"26-year-old Justin, from Florida, U.S. would definitely agree that it takes guts to finally meet the biological parents who never raised you. Fortunately, he conquered his fear and decided to reach out to his mother, who put him up for adoption many years ago. As it turns out, there was absolutely nothing to be afraid of.

Justin always knew that he was adopted and had tried to find his biological mother before. “It’s something that I had just always been curious about because I had known it my whole life. I wanted to see where I came from, I wanted to see my blood and people who bore a resemblance to me,” he told Bored Panda. Sadly, his search always led nowhere since he only knew two things – her name and that her father is a pastor. Only recently he had a stunning breakthrough, after Justin’s adoptive mother sent him an article about a pastor which she believed to be his grandfather. It took some digging around, but that article helped him to finally track down his mother and connect to her on Facebook. After a few intense days of waiting, her lovely response put a wide smile on his face. Justin found out that his biological parents and two siblings can’t wait to meet him.

Tracking down his parents was the best experience of Justin’s life. He was immediately accepted into the family. “I wasn’t a secret at all to anyone,” he said. His two biological sisters always knew about him. “They were just as ecstatic to meet me as I was them. One of them even cried when she first found out when she was little because she wanted a big brother so bad, haha. They’d never had a big brother and they were stoked! It was so amazing meeting and hugging them. I text all of them every day and we all constantly keep in touch!”

Justin revealed the reason he was put for adoption. “She decided to give me up because she wasn’t able to offer the life she wanted to give me at the time due to her age and circumstances, so she wanted a family that could give me every opportunity available. I thought that was the bravest part. She said every March 8th, (my birthday) she would always wonder what I was doing for my birthday. She thought about me so much. ”

With his beautiful story of reunifiction with his family, Justin wants to encourage other people to not be afraid. ” If there is ANYBODY who is reserved about meeting their biological parents or hesitant to reach out, I implore you to do so. You could be in for the experience of a lifetime. It’s so fulfilling and personally, I feel like my life has come full circle. I think it’s important to see where you come from and appreciate that. It’s the most beautiful thing in the world.”

Head lice. ,https://allthatsinteresting.com/south-american-combs,"It might be gross, but if you had the same problem that these people had, you would have wanted the comb as well.

Researchers in South America have discovered that the often ornately constructed ancient combs that they keep finding had a fairly unsavory purpose: delousing.

National Geographic reports that a recent study has found that the double-sided combs unearthed in archaeological digs in northern Chile were indeed used to get rid of lice.

These tiny parasites will bite the human head in order to ingest blood, which leaves the host with an itchy skull. And because these insects are only mere millimeters in size and their eggs are likewise tiny, rooting them all out is quite a chore without some fine-toothed tools like the combs found in Chile.

When lead researcher Bernardo Arriaza magnified the combs that his team had found in the graves of women who lived in the Atacama Desert between about 500 to 1500 A.D., they discovered traces of both dead lice and lice eggs on the comb’s teeth.

Of course, ancient Chileans aren’t the only ones known to delouse their hair with combs.

According to Atlas Obscura, parasitologist Kostas Mumcuoglu and anthropologist Joseph Zias discovered that 8 of the 11 first-century combs they unearthed in the Judean desert contained lice eggs.

“We had assumed that combs were used almost exclusively for cosmetic purposes,” the pair wrote in their original report. “Now it appears that they were also used as de-lousing implements. Indeed, the combs we examined appear to have been designed specifically for de-lousing.”

And why did these ancient peoples seem unwilling to solve the problem by simply shaving off all their hair when lice moved in? As Arriaza told National Geographic, “Vanity is stronger than itching. People prefer to feel ‘lousy’ than bald.”

Green. ,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/wolf-spiders-arent-completely-colorblind-but-they-can-only-make-out-this-one-color/,"The male peacock spider (actually multiple species) is a flamboyant critter that seduces mates with an extravagant display and rainbow-colored behind. It is not particularly surprising, then, that color perception is a massive evolutionary advantage. In 2017, biologists confirmed that unlike the vast majority of arachnids, peacock spiders do indeed see in color.

Now scientists want to know: Does this ability to perceive color extend to their drabbier cousins, the wolf spider? The answer: yes, but only if it is green.

Unlike humans with trichromatic vision, wolf spiders have dichromatic vision. This means that while we can detect red, green, and blue light, these eight-legged creatures can only make out green and ultraviolet light.

George Uetz, a professor of biology at the University of Cincinnati, presented the research with his students at the American Arachnological Society meeting in June. His lab contains 1,200 or so wolf spiders, making it every arachnophobe's worst nightmare but the ideal setting to study spider behavior.

To test wolf spiders' perception of color, the team watched male and female spiders react to a video of a courting spider – a demonstration that usually involves a lot of tapping, bouncing, and twerking. The digitalization of the dance meant the researchers could adjust the color and intensity of both the background and the courting spider.

The female spiders were more forthcoming when there was a high contrast between the courting spider and the background. There was a better response when the video was fixed to monochrome or color, in comparison to the grayscale version. Interestingly, color was also important for the male spiders, the researchers said, who in this scenario are ""eavesdroppers"" – that is, amateur dancers attempting to learn and mimic the other male spiders' mating rituals.

""What we found is that for female spiders, intensity matters more than color,"" Uetz, said in a statement. ""But for male eavesdroppers, color matters, too. That is the odd finding. We didn't expect that at all.""

The ability to make out green as opposed to any other color serves an evolutionary purpose. Mating displays that take place in spring and summer will most likely take place with a green backdrop, and as the researchers found out, spider eyesight appears to change according to the season.

""That makes a lot of sense because when you go out in the early season when the spiders first come out, there are no leaves on the trees so there is broad spectrum light,"" Uetz explained. ""But as the seasons change, leaves come out and everything turns green. Spiders have to be able to see the contrast against a lot of color backgrounds.""

Now, here's a video of a wolf spider doing his best to attract a mate.

An infinite amount of time because the Universe is constantly expanding. ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/traveling-faster-light-155500554.html,"PÖCKING, GERMANY / ACCESSWIRE / June 10, 2021 / Is it possible to travel faster than speed of light? According to the theory of relativity, it is not. A new understanding of dark energy and its inflation of the space of our universe with increasing speed may completely change this restriction.

If we should succeed in continuously inverting the dark energy influences to a very limited extent in front of spaceships, the distances to their destinations will get much shorter. And if this elimination of space is very effective, an observer may register a spaceship faster than speed of light, although the spaceship stays within the given limits of the theory of relativity.

The scientific discussion of Henryk Frystacki on the webpage https://www.escape-of-time.com or https://www.frystacki.de shows a simple model to understand the basic principles behind this idea. Even if the model is simple, it is compatible with general relativity and quantum physics.

The assumed stabilization of galaxies by dark matter gets another explanation in this model: an inverted part of dark energy keeps stars and planets on stable tracks.

Baby showers aren't the norm.

Baby showers are totally common in the United States, where Meghan is from, but they're not a usual part of pregnancy in the UK. However, the Duchess of Sussex did attend a baby shower thrown in her honor in New York City for her first child.

""Baby showers are largely something done in North America, not the UK,"" royal historian and expert Marlene A. Koenig explained to Business Insider before the event took place. ""Of course, Meghan can get baby gifts and I would not be surprised if her American and Canadian friends have a shower for her.

It was just a dust mask. ,https://www.popsugar.com/family/Little-Girl-Finds-Bra-Dad-Car-45051341,"It's no secret that kids can put a strain on a marriage. Those early years of sleepless nights and short fuses aren't easy, but I didn't realize that those unassuming babies would eventually turn into toddlers who seem hell-bent on actually destroying their parents' relationship. My kid has exposed more white lies than I care to mention, and — although I should be well aware that she's an unreliable narrator — I often take her highly untrustworthy word over my husband's.

It seems I'm not alone in any of this, as one dad posted an exchange on Twitter that nearly ruined his marriage when his 4-year-old daughter apparently outed him for having a bra — that didn't belong to his wife — in his car.

Thankfully, the hilarious misunderstanding has a happy ending:

My 4-y/o daughter tried to jam me up today.



Kid: Mommy, why is your bra in daddy's car?

Me: What!?

To provide airflow in case it's swallowed. ,https://www.sciencealert.com/why-there-are-holes-in-tops-of-pen-caps-lids-bic,"Sometimes, science is all about the mind-aching big picture. Like the idea that our Universe is just a giant hologram, or that we've actually detected gravitational waves from a neutron star collision. Or that we might not actually have as much free will as we think...

Those are really exciting concepts. But then there are other times when you come across a day-to-day application of technology that's so simple and yet so important, it reminds you what all this innovation is about. Case in point: that ubiquitous hole at the top of your BIC pen cap.

You've probably never given it much thought, or if you have, you've probably brushed it off as some random design feature that regulates air pressure or stops ink from drying out. And, yes, having a hole on their does allow you to close the lid properly without the air pressure issue. But it also serves another simple yet ingenious purpose - reducing the risk of choking deaths.

Turns out it's not just us who love chewing on pen lids - a whole lot of people do it, and that can lead to lids getting accidentally swallowed and lodged in the wind pipe, with potentially fatal consequences.

By simply adding a larger hole to the top of the lid, pen company BIC increased air flow and the chance that people would still be able to breathe even if that happens - a design feature that, quite literally, saves lives.

""In addition to help prevent the pen from leaking, all our BIC caps comply with international safety standards that attempt to minimise the risk of children accidentally inhaling pen caps,"" the company writes on its website. ""Some of these vented caps, like that used for the BIC Cristal, has a little hole in the top to comply with the existing safety standards.""

Roughly 100 people die in the US each year from choking on pen lids, a number that used to be higher, Matt Payton from The Independent reported in 2016. Other pen manufacturers have followed suit and added larger holes to the top of their pens too, he added.

(Note: if you do find yourself or a loved one choking on a pen lid, here are some tips on what to do.)

Not impressed by that beautiful application of technology to our daily lives? Well how about that tiny ""breather hole"" in airplane windows, which has the important job of managing the tension that builds up between internal and external pressure of an aeroplane?

And while you're at it, there's also a simple but awesome reason that plane windows always have rounded edges. Enjoy:

They tend to occur in sensitive places with many nerve endings. ,"https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/why-does-a-paper-cut-hurt-so-much#:~:text=Adding%20to%20the%20pain%20is,being%20sent%20to%20your%20brain.","Today’s Wonder of the Day was inspired by Justin. Justin Wonders, “ Why Does A Paper Cut Hurt ” Thanks for WONDERing with us, Justin!

Have you ever been seriously injured in the classroom or in the library? That might sound like an odd question with an obvious answer, but we bet you have!

As you've sorted through a pile of homework papers or dragged your finger along the edges of the pages of a book, we bet that at one time or another you've suddenly felt a jolt of pain. Ouch! What's going on here? Oh no! It's a paper cut!

Although pieces of paper don't otherwise resemble sharp knives, the edges of a piece of paper can at times be razor-sharp. If you've ever gotten a paper cut on your fingertip, you know the pain can feel disproportionate to what seems like a minor cut. So why do paper cuts hurt so badly?

Are you just being a wimp because you can't stand the sting of a paper cut? Nope! There are a few reasons that nearly everyone feels the same way about those annoying, painful paper cuts.

One major reason paper cuts hurt so much is their usual location: your fingertips. You usually don't get paper cuts on your belly, your knees, or your back. If you did, they wouldn't hurt nearly as much. Why?

Your fingertips are very sensitive. They're built to serve as the primary means by which your brain processes your sense of touch. They can feel pressure, pain, and temperature easily. There are more nerve fibers (called nociceptors) per square inch in your fingertips than most other areas of your body.

When you get a paper cut, the paper slices through these nerve fibers, resulting in many pain signals being sent to your brain. If that wasn't bad enough, you'll notice after a paper cut that you can't just stop using your hands until it heals. You constantly need to use your hands and, as you do so, your skin moves and the wound gets pressed and pulled upon, which delays healing and renews the pain you feel each time it happens.

The typical location of paper cuts explains why a paper cut on your fingertip hurts more than a similar cut on your belly or leg. However, a paper cut tends to hurt more than a different kind of cut, like from a knife, on your fingertip. Why is that?

To answer that question, we have to look at the object doing the cutting: the paper. Unlike a knife edge, which is extremely sharp and straight, the edge of a piece of paper is dull and flexible by comparison.

Have you ever tried to cut a piece of meat with a very dull knife or watched someone do it? The knife pulls and tears at the meat rather than slicing cleanly through it. That's what paper does to your fingertip when you get a paper cut. Although you can't really see it with your eyes, the edge of a piece of paper does a lot of microscopic damage to your fingertip when it cuts it.

Adding to the pain is the fact that paper cuts tend to be shallow and bleed little. This means many damaged nerve endings are left exposed near the surface of your skin, where they can be irritated easily, resulting in more pain signals being sent to your brain.

So what can you do when you get a paper cut? Clean it thoroughly and then cover it with a bandage (or a liquid bandage). Keeping the wound closed and covered will help to reduce the amount of irritation the nerve fibers experience, thereby reducing your pain.",Why Does a Paper Cut Hurt So Much?
Chicago. ,https://www.independentsentinel.com/this-city-has-the-distinction-of-being-named-the-rat-capital-of-the-usa/,"In time, Democrat cities tend to become Third World in a number of ways, especially when they are sanctuaries for criminals from foreign lands. One only needs to travel to New York City, LA, or Detroit to see the homeless, including drug addicts and mentally ill, living in squalor, laying in train stations, in front of stores, and elsewhere. Crime is rampant in these cities although some, like New York, fudge statistics. Baltimore bears the distinction of being the most dangerous city in America.

They’re all deeply in debt.

San Francisco was once a must-see location for world travelers but many tourist companies are taking it off the list, partly because of the pounds of human feces in the streets.

RAHM EMANUEL’S CHICAGO, THE ‘RAT CAPITAL’ OF AMERICA

Instead of feces, Chicago, another liberal creation, has rats. It was recently named the ‘rat capital’ of the USA.

A new study published by online apartment search service “RentHop”, found that 50,963 complaints were made to the city last year about troublesome rodents, according to the Daily Mail. That is far more than any other city.

When comparing the number of complaints per 100,000 residents, RentHop said, “Chicago topped the list with 1876.09 complaints per 100,000 residents,” according to the Daily Mail.

“The study also found that the number of complaints made by Chicago residents jumped 55 per cent since 2014.”

New York City came in second with 19,152 complaints, followed by Washington, D.C. (5,036 complaints), and Boston (2,488 complaints).

YOU GET USED TO IT AND THINK IT’S NORMAL

City residents have foolishly accepted it as part of city life.

“It’s part of living in a city,” Norma Rios-Sierra told The Chicago Tribune. “Even during the day, you’ll see them fly through the alley.'”

A spokesperson for the department of health and safety said complaints are not an indicator of the rat population in an area, it only shows Chicagoans care.

Yikes!

That’s not exactly accurate. What it shows is there are a lot of rats. The calls have gone from 42,000 to over 50,000 in one year, suggesting an increase in rats.

There are at least 26 crews baiting rats, but, still the rats keep coming.

“I’ve never seen anything like the rat infestation that we have in Chicago,” said Veterinarian Dr. Dylan Frederickson, noting that he administers treatments to dogs multiple times a year due to rodent activity.

Rat bites “can cause acute kidney failure, which is sometimes fatal,” he said.

Even puddles can be contaminated by the rats..

Chicago has a number of glaring faults. It is still one of the top murder capitals, even over rat infestation, with 290 murders in the city so far this year.

According to CNBC calculations, a $1,000 investment made in early August 2008 would be worth more than $9,222.50 as of August 2, 2018, or over nine times as much, including price appreciation and excluding dividends.

Apple shares hit a historic $1 trillion market cap value on Thursday, becoming the first public U.S. company to ever reach the milestone. The stock briefly hit the $207.05 per share price that was needed to bring Apple to the $1 trillion mark before retreating, CNBC reports .

Apple's all-time stock growth, as of August 2, 2018 at 12:36 p.m. (Click to enlarge.)

While Apple's stock has performed well, any individual stock can over- or under-perform and past returns do not predict future results.

Apple's recent surge allowed the software company to defeat e-commerce giant Amazon in the race to become the first publicly traded U.S. company worth $1 trillion.

Apple stock also soared in May, when Berkshire Hathaway chief executive officer Warren Buffett revealed that his company bought 75 million shares of Apple, adding to the 165.3 million shares it already owned.

Some analysts had concerns about a possible slowdown in iPhone sales after the company's quarterly earnings report showed Apple sold fewer iPhones than expected. But still, in his interview on ""Squawk Box,"" Buffett said long-term investors shouldn't be too concerned about near-term iPhone sales.

""The idea that you're going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X ... are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,"" he said.

If you're looking to invest in the next Apple or considering putting some money in the stock market, experienced investors like Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest you start carefully.

Begin with index funds, they say, which hold every stock in an index, offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills, and fluctuate with the market to eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.

No one. ,https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/heres-who-is-rumored-to-replace-james-gunn-on-guardians-of-the-g/,"If Marvel does not rehire James Gunn to direct Guardians of the Galay vol. 3 -- which is the safe bet in today's installment of the ever-churning rumor mill surrounding this controversy -- they will likely go outside of their normal circle and hire someone new to Marvel.

According to Variety, while Disney is disinclined to rehire Gunn, the report also seemed to exclude popular fan picks like Taika Waititi, Joe and Anthony Russo, and Jon Favreau.

The explanation is simple enough: those are all superstar directors with a lot of other irons in the fire, and Disney's need to get the Guardians threequel back on track relatively quickly would be complicated by asking them to step away from another project. In some cases, their other projects are also for parent company Disney, which makes the math even harder.

Gunn was fired from the movie in July, after a number of offensive tweets from before his time with Marvel were revived by alt-right provocateur Mike Cernovich and a social media campaign was mounted to have him fired. Cernovich had targeted Gunn due to the director's vocal opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Besides being removed as writer and director of Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, Gunn's status on an as-yet-undisclosed project for Sony, which was to be announced at Comic Con International in San Diego, is up in the air. The project's announcement and Gunn's appearance were both cancelled after his firing by Disney.

As pressure mounted on social media ahead of his firing, Gunn had reiterated an earlier apology for the tweets that got him in trouble, originally made before Guardians of the Galaxy went into production. The Guardians of the Galaxy cast and other celebrities have issued statements in support of Gunn, asking for the public to believe him when he says that he has changed in the years since he published the offensive remarks.

Critics have countered that Gunn was ""old enough to know better"" even a decade ago, or that some of the tweets -- which included jokes about rape and pedophilia -- are unforgivable for someone who works at a family-friendly company like Disney. A few outliers and conspiracy theorists have speculated that the jokes indicate Gunn actually is a pedophile or rapist, with former Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz suggesting that Gunn ""should be prosecuted"" if the tweets ""are true.""

UPDATE: An earlier version of this story repeated erroneous reports that some Marvel actors had unfollowed Gunn's Twitter account following the firing. We regret the error.

Gunn has said that he understands the business decision Disney made, and reiterated his apology for the jokes, saying that he accepts responsibility for them.

Before working at Disney, Gunn worked on Warner Bros.' live-action Scooby-Doo franchise and with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice director Zack Snyder on a remake of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. His non-franchise films (which include Slither, Super, and Tromeo and Juliet) have tended to be edgy, sexy, violent, and subversive, which at first made him seem like an odd choice to join the safe, predictable Marvel Studios family. A number of these tweets, as well as since-deleted blog posts, came up in interviews and thinkpieces around the time Marvel brought Gunn on board.

Variety suggests that it is likely ""Disney will reach outside the Marvel family to find a director with the kind of offbeat sensibility to handle the comic-book franchise.""

Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, which was designed as the final installment with the current crop of Guardians characters, was slated for a 2020 theatrical release, which puts the production up against a wall in terms of finding a competent new director and developing a new script (Gunn had already turned in at least one draft) in time to begin production for the projected release date.",Here's Who Is Rumored to Replace James Gunn on 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'

Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster speeds through solar system

The sports car speeding through space could come close to crossing paths with Earth again towards the end of 2020 it has been revealed. The cherry-red electric Tesla Roadster, which blasted off into Space on February 6 onboard the Falcon Heavy rocket, is still soaring near to Earth. But in April this year the Roadster will swing away towards Mars, on an orbital path that will take it beyond the Red Planet and close to the astroid belt. Thereafter Starman will complete a trip around the solar system before flying in-between Earth and Mars in two year’s time, according to the WhereIsRoadster.com tracker.

But the good news for those below is that the odds of the Tesla ever actually crash landing back on Earth are pretty small – about 6 percent in fact. The vehicle will continue to orbit the star at the heart of the solar system for another million years before it crashes into anything. Orbital dynamics experts Hanno Rein, Daniel Tamayo and David Vokrouhlicky, outlined this in their study of the car’s position. In their research paper, titled The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets, the scientists underlined that there is no genuine threat from Starman.

WHEREISROADSTER.COM Tesla Roadster location: The electric car will fly in-between Mars and Earth in 2020

The three experts underlined that it is nigh impossible to precisely chart the Roadster’s position as it sails across the vast expanse of space. Lead author of the study, Mr Rein, said: “Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun.” According to the expert, the Roadster will come “relatively close” to its home planet every 30 years, and its trajectory will shift slightly every time. The Roadster is expected to make it next close encounter with Earth in 2091, when it approaches at a distance similar to that between the planet and its moon.

At its farthest distance from Earth, the roadster will be 1.67 times Earth’s distance from the sun.

Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun Hanno Rein, University of Toronto

The three researchers from the University of Toronto ran countless simulations to come to the conclusion that there is a 6 percent chance of the Roadster crashing into Earth and a 2.5 percent chance of hitting Venus. Mr Rein said: “We’ve not seen any single collision with Mars in 240 simulations, though we continue to run them and see what happens. “The likely outcome is that it will crash, in tens of millions of years, into Earth or Venus or the sun.”

Yes. ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/04/is-owning-a-dog-good-for-your-health,"Dogs really are our best friends, according to a Swedish study that says canine ownership could reduce heart disease. A study of 3.4 million people between the ages of 40 and 80 found that having a dog was associated with a 23% reduction in death from heart disease and a 20% lower risk of dying from any cause over the 12 years of the study. Previous studies have suggested dogs relieve social isolation and depression – both linked to an increased risk of heart disease and early death.

The solution



Dog owners show better responses to stress (their blood pressure and pulse rates don’t soar), have higher levels of physical activity and slightly lower cholesterol levels. The American Heart Association was sufficiently swayed by a review of dozens of studies to release a statement in 2013 saying that owning a dog “was probably” associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Their reluctance to more strongly endorse dog ownership is because most studies are what is called observational – researchers note an association, but can’t prove causation. This means that other factors might explain why dog owners are healthier than, say, goldfish owners – for example, perhaps only people who are fit in the first place buy pets that need daily walkies.

Tove Fall, an epidemiologist and the lead author of this latest study, says they tried their best to allow for any differences in education, existing ill-health and lifestyles between those with and without dogs. The study found the biggest positive impact of having a dog was on people living alone. “It seems that a dog can be a substitute for living with other people in terms of reducing the risk of dying,” says Fall. “Dogs encourage you to walk, they provide social support and they make life more meaningful. If you have a dog, you interact more with other people. If you do get ill and go into hospital and you have a dog, there’s a huge motivation to try to get back home.”

Of course, getting a dog and watching it from your sofa while you eat fatty food is not going to reduce your risk of heart disease. And a toy dog may look cute, but won’t have any effect either. Fall’s study showed the most health benefits came from having retrievers or pointers. Until her German shorthaired pointer died last year, she ran 10km with her most days. “In Sweden, we have one of the lowest rates of dog ownership in Europe,” says Fall, who has recently got a new puppy. “Maybe this will increase the acceptance that dogs are important to people.”",Is owning a dog good for your health?

Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has revealed the moving reason his kids were his motivation to lose 50 pounds of weight and how you can do it too...

Gordon Ramsay’s weight loss was all thanks so a very simple change in his lifestyle.

The celebrity chef was speaking on the Today show in America when he showed off his impressive 50 pound weight loss – that’s 22 bags of sugar!

Gordon revealed that portion control was at the heart of his weight loss and changing when he ate as well as how much he ate.

As a chef, it is obviously near impossible to steer clear of things like carbs and fattening ingredients like cream and butter that deliver heaps of flavour.

After all if you’re heading out to a restaurant for a date night do you really want to be thinking about a low-fat or low-calorie dinner? You’ll probably be going for the steak and chips with a dessert to finish and a large glass (or two) of wine – we would too!

So instead of restricting his diet in terms of the things he could eat, Gordon restricts his eating to five small meals a day.

He explained: ‘I’m very good now at eating five times a day, but small amounts as opposed to a big breakfast, big lunch and big dinner.’

Gordon’s weight loss was all down to portion control and changing when he eats

Gordon also offered some health advice and urged people to think about the quality of the food they are eating over the quality.

He said: ‘If Americans toned down the sort of quantity and honed in on the quality, you’d feel so much better. So it’s about sort-of eating better, but eating less at the same time.’

This is something Brits can relate too as well given obesity is at an all time high and one in five children in Year 6 at school were classified as obese last year.

The motivation behind Gordon’s weight loss is also very heartwarming and something all parents can relate to.

Gordon explained: ‘My father passed of a heart attack at 53. That man never ever ate in my restaurant, and it pains me today to think that.’

Epic Games has seen its stock rise and rise this year as the free-to-play battle royale blockbuster continues to dominate all things gaming.

And as millions of addicted players across the globe plough endless hours into the title, where 100 battle it out online at a time in a fight to the death, the money just keeps rolling in thanks to buyable add-ons.

The game has now earned more than $1.2billion (£900million) since its launch in September and is on track for $2bn by year end.

And new analysis from Bloomberg suggests that with Fortnite’s success, Epic Games is now worth over $8.5 billion.

This value is based on all of Epic’s revenues, including its Unreal Engine which many developers use to make games for consoles.

Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic Games, created the company in his parent’s basement 27 years ago.

Sweeney is currently the controlling shareholder of Epic Games.

Bloomberg said that making Fortnite free to play, with in-game purchases, has paid off and made him a billionaire.

Instead of shelling out upwards of £40 for the game, players buy online V-bucks, a virtual currency they can exchange during play for outfits, called skins, celebratory dances or special missions that can cost as much as £20 each.

“On the revenue side, they’ve done something that’s really unique, which is come up with a perception of exclusivity,” said Michael Pachter, a video game analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc.

Many accessories in the Fortnite shop are available on a limited basis, prompting players to buy before coveted items disappear from virtual shelves.

Pachter said: “If you see another player in a leopard skin and go to the store and see it’s no longer available, you think, Shoot, I’ve got to move on it next time.”

While most games hit peak popularity shortly after launch, Fortnite was still drawing millions of new users six months on, thanks to a broadly appealing aesthetic that’s more comic mischief than graphic violence.

Celebrity fans such as rapper Drake have pushed it further into mainstream consciousness.

As a game that’s social, easy to play and hard to master, it’s been a particular hit with school-age kids, raising concerns from teachers and parents reporting obsessive playing during class.

And counselling experts have this week warned parents to limit their kids time with the game as they see a boom in gaming addictions.

Analyst in the Bloomberg piece suggested that if Epic Games were put up for sale, it would be worth around $14billion (£10.6bn) based on similar values that EA, which makes Battlefield, and Activision Blizzard, which makes Call of Duty, are worth.

They also added that even if Fortnite’s momentum slowed down, the company could still expect to earn $1 billion a year from the title’s in-game sales.

New data also released by Sensor Tower recently stated that Fortnite on mobile makes around $2million a day, up from $1.5million earlier this year, thanks to Season 5.",Fortnite SHOCK; You won't believe how much money this game is making
Chicken. ,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-official-this-food-is-the-most-likely-to-make-you-sick-2018-08-01,"The role that chicken plays in foodborne illness outbreaks is nothing to cluck at.

Chicken was responsible for more illnesses associated with outbreaks of foodborne pathogens than any other food product, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In total, 12% of these illnesses were linked to chicken. After chicken, pork and seeded vegetables caused the most illnesses due to contamination by food borne pathogens, at 10% each.

While chicken led to more illnesses, other foods — fish and dairy — prompted more pathogen outbreaks. To produce its findings, the CDC analyzed 5,760 outbreaks from 2009 to 2015. These outbreaks were responsible for more than 100,000 illnesses — nearly 5,700 of which resulted in hospitalizations, and 145 of which led to deaths.

One particular multi-state outbreak involving salmonella in chicken, which occurred in 2013 and 2014, caused the second most hospitalizations (200 cases) of any single outbreak, exceeded only by a 2015 salmonella outbreak tied to cucumbers (204 hospitalizations).

The poultry industry cries foul over the CDC report

The poultry industry has asked government regulators in recent years to allow chicken producers to ramp up the speed of production lines, arguing this will allow them to maintain competitiveness with international producers. Thus far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service has denied these petitions.

“Outside of maybe the nuclear energy industry, the U.S. meat and poultry industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the United States,” said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, a trade group that represents chicken farmers and producers. “To say otherwise is either disingenuous, or represents a gross misunderstanding of how the industry operates.”

Because the CDC data are three years old, Super said it did not capture improvements made after the nationwide new poultry inspection system went into effect in 2014. Between 2017 and 2018, the percentage of whole chickens that tested positive for salmonella decreased from 5.42% to 4.9%, according to USDA data. At the same time, however, the share of salmonella-contaminated chicken parts rose from 14.16% to 14.83%.

Consumer advocates argue for more regulation of chicken

Consumer safety advocates argue that more—not less— regulation is needed. “Rather than focusing on schemes to boost industry profits—such as eliminating slaughterhouse line-speed limits—we should be talking about why the U.S. lags so far behind other countries on issues like addressing salmonella contamination in poultry, and what can be done to avoid some of these illnesses and the havoc they wreak on families,” said Thomas Gremillion, director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America.

In the European Union, the number of illnesses caused by salmonella has decreased between 2008 and 2016, while in the U.S. it has remained higher.

One contributing factor could be how the federal government classifies salmonella. A loophole in food safety laws means that the bacteria isn’t considered an “adulterant” like certain strains of E.coli. When a substance is classified legally as an adulterant it means that food contaminated with it cannot be distributed — other adulterants include sawdust and plastic.

While food producers are still under scrutiny from the USDA to stamp down on salmonella contamination, positive tests for the bacteria don’t automatically prompt a recall, according to Bill Marler, a Seattle-based lawyer who specializes in cases involving food safety. Instead, a recall only happens if an outbreak of illnesses is confirmed.

“Therefore, the USDA essentially allows companies to produce and sell salmonella- or campylobacter-tainted chicken,” Marler said.

Marler argued that the classification of one strain of E.coli (E.coli 0157) as an adulterant led to a significant decrease in the number of illnesses caused by the pathogen. The strain only earned that classification after an outbreak killed four children and landed 171 other people in the hospital in 1994.

But researchers at the University of Minnesota argued that classifying salmonella as an adulterant would not have the same significantly positive impact on public health, in part because current testing methods are not practical at supporting the level of inspection that would be needed to prevent salmonella-contaminated food from being distributed.",It’s official: This food is the most likely to make you sick

Hardware on your jeans or belt. ,https://www.ladbible.com/stylish/fashion-ever-wondered-why-your-t-shirts-get-all-those-little-holes-in-them-20180724,"Have you ever wondered why you can safely put away a t shirt after wearing it just once, only to find the next time you want to wear it, it's got a little annoying hole in?

Of course you have, and it turns out you're not alone, but fear not, fact finders as one of life's biggest fashion mysteries has been solved.

Now, I know some people will definitely be thinking moths. I know I was before I found out the real reason behind the suspicious holes.

Advert 10

But it turns out that the most likely reason for tiny holes around your torso is actually down to your jeans or belt.

CEO of American Giant, Bayard Winthrop, told Today: ""That part of the shirt is a primary abrasion point.

""The fabric there is (rubbing) against the hardware: your belt, the tops of your jeans, all points of wear. The friction, repeated over time, has caused the fabric to deteriorate.""

But what can you do to combat these pesky little holes and keep your t shirts looking good as new?

Advert 10





Well, Bayard goes on to say that the fabric of the t-shirt is mostly to blame, so that's where we need to make the change.

""The garment itself might be produced as cheaply as possible,"" he said. ""Cutting costs where possible.

Advert 10

""Look for brands that call out what type of cotton they are using - a longer fibre length is a good sign - and how the garment is constructed.""

So, there we have it, you can either buy more expensive clothes or stop wearing jeans and belts. Neither of those are an ideal solution for me, to be honest.

Having said all that, the teeny holes could well be down to moths, the pesky little buggers do enjoy dining on clothing after all.

Apparently, the easy way to tell if its your jeans wrecking your clothes or a bunch of moths is to check for the number of small holes. If there's a cluster of holes, it's likely due to moths making a snack out of your clobber, however, if it's just one small hole, then you can probably blame your jeans.

"""I literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from .25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago."" ",https://www.investopedia.com/news/tesla-billionaire-elon-musk-reveals-how-much-bitcoin-he-owns/,"Billionaire Elon Musk is a huge fan of cutting-edge technology and is usually ahead of the curve when it comes to finance, but he's not a bitcoin bull. The co-founder of Tesla Inc. revealed on Twitter that he owns only a tiny fraction of one bitcoin token.

""I literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from .25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago,"" Musk confessed. Using today's bitcoin price of about $10,000 a coin, that translates to $2,500.

The serial entrepreneur – whose net worth tops $20 billion – made the revelation in response to a question about an online scam where random users pose as celebrities (like Musk) in a bid to steal people's cryptocurrencies. (See also: IRS Wants to Tax Your Bitcoin Gains: Orders Coinbase to Turn Over User Data.)

Musk's indifference to bitcoin probably wasn't a shock to his fans, since he recently revealed that ""a friend sent me part of a BTC a few years, but I don’t know where it is."" (See also: Elon Musk: Education, Success Story and Net Worth.)

Is Elon Musk Satoshi Nakamoto?

In November 2017, Musk denied rumors that he was Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of bitcoin. The brouhaha erupted after a former SpaceX intern, Sahil Gupta, in a blog post on Medium, wrote ""Satoshi is probably Elon.""

Gupta reasoned: ""Elon is a self-taught polymath. He’s repeatedly innovated across fields by reading books on a subject and applying the knowledge. It’s how he built rockets, invented the Hyperloop (which he released to the world as a paper), and could have invented Bitcoin.""

The true identity of Nakamoto has never been confirmed, but there has been a steady stream of speculation about who he is ever since bitcoin quietly launched in 2009. (See also: Tesla CEO Elon Musk Denies Being Bitcoin Creator.)

Meanwhile, Musk isn't the only billionaire who's skeptical of bitcoin and the crypto phenomenon. Bitcoin cynics are put off by the virtual currency's erratic price movements, lack of regulation, and absence of a valuation guarantee because it's not backed by a central bank.

Billionaire Charlie Munger, the second-in-command at Berkshire Hathaway, slammed bitcoin as a ""noxious poison"" and called the media hype surrounding digital currencies ""totally asinine.""

Similarly, Munger's boss, mega-billionaire Warren Buffett, predicted that cryptocurrencies will almost certainly ""come to a bad ending."" (See more: Bitcoin Is 'Poison,' Says Berkshire Billionaire Charlie Munger.)

And in its latest letter to clients, the Paul Singer-led Elliott Management, which oversees $34 billion in assets, excoriated cryptocurrencies as a bubble, a scam and a fraud. “This is not just a bubble,"" Elliott wrote.

To leave fingerprints as proof that they pulled you over in case you flee. ,https://www.rd.com/article/cops-touch-cars-tail-light-traffic-stops/,"Nope, it's not because they're trying to buff out that scratch above your bumper.

Say you’re driving on your local road, and you enter a construction zone. The construction is wrapping up for the day, the sun is coming down, and you just miss the “Reduce Speed Ahead” sign. You come to the Stop sign and notice a state trooper pulled up behind you. The trooper’s flashers turn on, and you realize that you may have been speeding. Better brush up on the 10 tricks to beat any speeding ticket!

You pull over, and as the officer approaches the car, you hear a quick tap on the back of your car. The officer touches your tail light as he came to your window, and you come to realize that you’ve seen this before. Actually, you’ve seen this quite a bit. Police officers will often briefly tap your car’s tail light before approaching the window.

This common cop practice isn’t rooted in superstition, and it isn’t a secret. As it turns out, it’s based in the officer’s well-being.



According to criminal defense attorney and DWI/DUI lawyer Joe Hoelscher, this routine maneuver serves as a sort of bread crumb left to prove that the police officer had approached that particular vehicle. “Leaving a thumbprint on the brake light is an old-school way to tag a car with a fingerprint, so it can be identified conclusively as the vehicle involved in a stop should the officer become incapacitated,” explains Hoelscher. Basically, if the officer’s safety were to be jeopardized by the driver, or if the car fled, investigators could track that fingerprint to the suspect in question. Who knew?! Plus, find out more explanations for little things you’ve always wondered about.

Why is it “old-school”? Before dash cams and body cams, the fingerprints left on the tail light served as a primary form of evidence about the traffic stop. But, despite all of that new technology, you probably will still see cops do this. “It is less important now that video is ubiquitous, but it requires so little effort that officers are still trained to do it,” Hoelscher explains.

Another theory suggests that the tap can serve as a means of jarring an intoxicated driver or a driver in possession of illegal materials. But Hoelscher claims that this isn’t true. On the contrary, “officers should do it subtly so the driver doesn’t realize it’s there,” he says. “Otherwise, a perpetrator could remove the print.”

Hoelscher even suggests a way to use this common cop behavior to your advantage. He notes that when a car’s tail lights are dusty, the cop’s fingerprint can stand out. If this is the case for your car, “the next officer might be more aggressive realizing you’ve had another law enforcement interaction recently.” So, he says, “my advice is to wash your car after getting a ticket or the next time you get stopped.” And there are more tips where that came from with these 45 secrets police officers want you to know.",This Is Why Cops Touch Your Car’s Tail Light During Traffic Stops
It's very spicy. ,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/this-ice-cream-is-so-hot-you-need-to-sign-a-waiver-to-try-it/,"Forget flowers. This Valentine’s Day we’ve got the daredevil in your life covered.

Scotland’s Aldwych Café and Ice Cream Parlor is dishing up what they’ve deemed the world’s “most dangerous ice cream”.

You have to be 18 years or older just to get a taste. Even if you pass the adult test, you’ll still need to sign a waiver warning of the ice cream’s “risk of personal injury, illness, and possible loss of life”.

Okay, maybe make sure your date is okay with that whole risk of death thing.

The makers of Respiro Del Diavolo – Italian for “Breath of the Devil” – claim the velvety red ice cream is 500 times hotter than Tabasco sauce. The Carolina Reaper pepper used comes in at a whopping 1,569,300 SHU on the Scoville scale – a measurement of pungency (spicy heat) of chili peppers.

It’s so hot, the staff say they have to wear gloves when handling the ice cream.

We’re not totally sure what's in the recipe, though the owners say it comes from a secret family recipe dating back to 1936.

Food is made spicy by an active component called capsaicin that acts as an evolutionary tool meant to dissuade potential eaters with physical pain. When consumed, capsaicin binds to pain receptors in nerves called TRPV1 in the same way heat sends warning signals to your brain through pain, hence the burning sensation in your mouth. The body reacts to this threat by removing it by overheating, sweating, rushing blood to your face, tearing up eyes, and runny noses.

Eating spicy foods takes an acquired taste that comes from eating them, becoming desensitized, and building up a tolerance. If you’re one of those people who doesn't understand how someone could stand spicy foods, then you’re not alone. One study suggests men who smother their food in spicy stuff might have higher levels of testosterone, while another paper suggests men who walk on the spicy side do it for the attention and thrill (typical).

Whether your seeking a thrill or looking to impress your date, this ice cream is sure to hit the spot. Plus, it's pretty cheap. The owners say it won't cost any more than their regularly priced ice cream scoops.

That’s because one brave Russian decided to find the answer; it was not good.

Brilliant YouTuber Garage 54 ENG, who recently put wooden pistons into a VAZ-2106, did something even dumber (or, arguably, more brilliant) a few weeks ago: he stuffed a plastic bag full of Mentos under his car’s valve cover right against the timing chain sprocket, and filled the engine to the very brim with 21 liters of Coke:

“Everything is in perfect order,” the host says (translated from Russian by BMI Russia). “Our baggy is in place, so is the battery. Now we try firing it up.”

But the engine doesn’t turn over.

So the host switches to another battery, but still nothing. After bumping the ignition a bunch of times, the engine eventually cranks over, and shoots Coke from its oil filler tube (likely due to the pistons pumping it out, not from the Mentos reaction):

“Sunova bitch! Start already!” the mechanic exclaims as the motor refuses to fire. But the old VAZ never springs to life.

According to the host, the cola’s low viscosity meant the soda made its way past the piston rings and into the combustion chamber, thwarting any chance of ignition. The wrencher drained some of the Coke onto the ground to try to reduce the chance of any getting into the combustion chamber, but by that time, the engine had seized up.

Which, if we’re honest, is not a surprising result. Coca-Cola isn’t exactly known for its lubrication abilities. So yes, this idea was as dumb as it sounded when you first read the headline.

So, what is the point of wearing a watch that, to put it frankly, is broken?

According to The Wall Street Journal, it’s all about prioritising style over substance.

Men’s fashion editor Jacob Gallagher explains that men who follow this trend may have been inspired by artist Andy Warhol, who often wore a Cartier Tank watch that didn’t tell the correct time.

“I don’t wear a Tank watch to tell the time,” Warhol stated in 1973. “Actually I never even wind it. I wear a Tank because it is the watch to wear!”

While some may view the practise of wearing an inoperative watch as strange, others would argue that there is logic in keeping up appearances.

Stephen Viscusi, author of On the Job: How to Make it in the Real World of Work, is of the opinion that wearing a wristwatch could be a make or break decision when applying for a job.

“My advice to you millennials who use your phones as timepieces is simple: cut it out! Go buy a wristwatch!” Viscusi wrote for Huffington Post.

“It may be a gimmick, but believe me, it will separate you from everyone else your own age interviewing for the same job.”

While the notion of wearing a luxurious wristwatch may not be feasible for those unwilling to dish out thousands of pounds on a gadget that has no function, others may work around this by renting watches for a fraction of the price.

Shlomo Gelernter, a real estate broker from Manhattan, explained to The Independent that he wears flashy watches every single day by leasing them temporarily.

“It’s just like having a nice car, or a nice house. People’s perception of who you are changes instantaneously, without even speaking a word to you, when they notice a luxury timepiece on your wrist,” he said.

They were renovating the house. ,https://bridesblush.com/inspiration/teens-surprise-parents-fb-yh/,"

Out Of Left Field Hardworking parents of teenagers often dream of taking a long vacation with the hopes that their kids won’t destroy the house while they’re gone. The Schoonovers, however, found a surprise that really blew their minds.

Vacationer’s Dream The Schoonover family may live in the popular vacation spot of North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, but that didn’t mean Karen and Chip still didn’t need to get away from home now and again. Precarious as it might have seemed, they figured their four daughters were old enough to hold down the fort, and they decided to take a week-long trip one December. They never expected the surprise their children would concoct during their time away from home.

The Four Hs With each successive girl that joined the Schoonover family, Karen and Chip decided that each of them should have a name that started with “H.” Heather is their eldest daughter, and she had already left home several years before the incident when she got married. Her younger sisters, Hollie, Halice, and Haley were determined to enlist her into their scheme. As their parents set off for vacation, the girls were ready to set their plan into action.

The Shining Light Hollie was the mastermind behind the plan to surprise their parents. As the second oldest, she was best placed to organize her three sisters. The moment their parents were out of the house, the four girls sprang into action, as they hoped they could work together in order to pull off the greatest Christmas surprise their parents had ever seen. Hollie smartly had the youngest sister Haley set up her camera and start recording from the beginning, as their plan had several layers to it.

A Star In The Making Even though the plan was Hollie’s by design, she never quite aspired to become an interior designer. In fact, Hollie had always harbored loftier ambitions, as she hoped to become a working actress and singer. Entertainment is not an easy industry to break into, however, so in the meantime, she has begun offering her services to friends and family as a makeup artist. It’s a career path she hopes will materialize as she continues her training.

Snapshots Of Time If Hollie loved to be in front of the camera, youngest sister Haley loved to be behind it. The two sisters have often used each other in order to practice their respective arts, as Hollie would do her sisters’ make up, and Haley would capture the final product. In terms of the Christmas gift the girls were hoping to give their parents, Hollie and Haley’s artistic vision and skills were a perfect match for what they were planning.

Taking A Study Break While her two more artistic sisters chose a less traditional path as they sought to make their names in more visual mediums, Halice wanted to follow her eldest sister’s path and attend university. Halice didn’t stray too far from home when she matriculated into Coastal Carolina University. She wasn’t the first in the family to attend the school though, as Heather charted the same path several years before. Upon finishing her Bachelor’s degree, she wants to go to graduate school for physical therapy.

Back To Her Roots The three younger sisters may have had slightly more stake in their Christmas gift given that they’re all still local to North Myrtle Beach, while their eldest sister has broken from the mold. She still resides in South Carolina, but has moved further inland with her husband, where she works in marketing for a real estate company. Even so, it was important to Heather to return home and help her sisters make a dream come true for their parents.

Making Big Moves The Schoonover family may feel like an integral part of the North Myrtle Beach community, but that wasn’t always the case. All four of the girls were born in Seminole, Florida, where they spent the better part of their childhoods. After their relocation, however, the whole Schoonover family began to really feel that North Myrtle Beach was where they were meant to be. This love of their home made the girls’ gift all the more meaningful to them.

Racking Up The Views It was the Schoonover sisters’ luck that they made a video of just what they were doing in the house while their parents were away, as it quickly took over the internet. Users flocked to their humble YouTube video in droves, feeling just as overwhelmed by the end of it as the girls’ parents felt when they returned from their trip. The viewers they touched then sent the video to their friends, making the impact of their surprise even greater.

Starting From The Bottom The girls were hoping to give their home a little bit of a makeover while their parents were away. Though some children think that simply cleaning up the house is enough of a gift for hard-working parents, the girls wanted to take things a step further. However, they didn’t realize just how much work they’d be taking on. Not only that, none of them had ever engaged in this sort of home renovation before, making it uncertain if they’d pull off their Christmas gift.

Out With The Old The girls wanted to be as thorough as possible when it came to updating their home without their parent’s knowledge. Cleaning things up was just going to be a start. As they surveyed the rooms they planned to tackle, all the girls could see were mountains of junk that needed to be removed. Despite thinking it might take only a few hours at most to sort through all of the stuff, their first step took the better part of the day.

A Clean Slate Their home renovation wasn’t going to get any easier as the girls moved on to the real renovation tasks at hand. Hollie may have thought they were being overly ambitious with their design plan, but even so, they pressed forward, ripping out all of the old carpeting in the process. As they muddled their way into the bulk of the most strenuous work, the girls discovered that the best way to dispose of the old carpeting was by throwing it out of a window.

I Get By With A Little Help From My Friends Perhaps the girls were inspired by the myriad of home makeover shows which depict families receiving a dream house in the blink of an eye, but it quickly became apparent that they’d underestimated just how long their Christmas gift was going to take them to complete. The girls figured it couldn’t hurt to recruit some extra workers, and they knew just the boys for the job. They just had to hope they had the muscle around when they needed it most.

Pooling Together As Hollie and her sisters plotted the gift of a lifetime for their parents, they wanted to make sure that as much of the decor was as updated as possible. That meant not only cleaning up and painting, but also chipping in to buy some new furniture for the living room. The girls would find, however, that getting new furniture was far easier than disposing of the old. Despite their collective muscle, they documented a hilarious struggle to push their old couch off the porch and into the yard.

Flexing Their Abilities The four girls might have quickly discovered just how strenuous of a task they had taken on, but not all of them were strangers to physical activity. Eldest sister Heather often hosts workout accountability groups, helping others to stay on track to achieve their fitness and wellness goals. Halice is another one of the Schoonover sisters to have fitness on her mind, as she was in the middle of studying for a degree in exercise and sports science during the house renovation.

Playing To Their Strengths Being so close in age definitely had its advantage for the Schoonover sisters, as they were no strangers to working together. Such a big project like renovating their whole house in a week would have been impossible if they weren’t able to band together and use each girls’ strengths in order to keep pressing forward. When they were younger, the girls would work together in much the same way as they pursued a family past time of geocaching.

Hitting The Hurdles Anyone who has undertaken a serious project can understand that often, as you near the midpoint of your work, you feel that you’ve been slogging on for ages with no end in sight. The girls felt like they were hitting their breaking point, and yet they were only on their third day of work. As they surveyed their progress, all they saw was a house in shambles and many tasks to be completed that were far beyond any of their expertise.

Looking For A Boost As dawn rose over the chilly morning, the girls grumbled their way out of bed, pulling on their old, dirty clothes in preparation for the day’s work. None of them had slept much the night before, and they were struggling to stay motivated, as their house was nearly unlivable. In order to get themselves into work mode, one of the girls came home with a pack of energy drinks, in which the rest of her sisters happily partook.

Wearing Them Down Despite the extra help they had enlisted, painting every single room in the house was an undertaking far more serious than what the girls could have possibly expected. They might have thought that moving furniture was going to be the hardest part, but when they found themselves still painting the edges of the windows in one room late into the evening, it took all of their collective encouragement to convince each other not to call it quits.

Feeling The Physical Strain The week was more than halfway through, and the girls still had a mountain of work in front of them. They weren’t just tired from the lack of sleep. As they noted in their video, their backs were beginning to hurt, and their legs were still sore from the amount of standing they’d done so far. It was love for their parents that continued driving their project, even as the girls felt a little bit like they were floundering.

Finding Their Numbers Depleted The days kept stretching on ahead of the girls, but little by little, they were making progress. If they thought the previous day had been tough, however, they would find their struggle would increase, as only Haley and Hollie were available to put in time on the house on the fifth day of their renovations. The girls didn’t want their lack of numbers to affect the progress they could make significantly, and they knew they were in the home stretch.

All By Themelves Haley took the camera for herself to document the progress the two girls had made by themselves on day five. Hollie sat on the floor of the dining room, slowly painting details on the wall in a pale blue. Haley explained that it had been just the two of them, but even so, a major accomplishment had occurred. The two girls, all on their own, had installed the new carpets in place of what they’d tossed in the trash.

Up All night It was 7 AM when the alarm rang, rousing Hollie and Haley from their much-needed sleep. The girls had been determined to keep working until they literally couldn’t go on anymore, as the kitchen was only half painted. Half of the cabinets needed their second coat of paint while the other half needed their first coat of paint. It was their final day to get work done before their parents arrived home the next morning, and the gift needed to be complete.

Hearts On Their Sleeves It was Hollie who took the camera in the car on the morning of day six if only to show off to their parents just how tired they were. When asking Haley how she felt, she responded, “I feel like I’m in the army.” Hollie got candid with the camera, showing off her “stress acne” that had flared up around her face. They needed to put the finishing touches on the rest of the painting, and then put all the furniture back.

Using A Decoy The day their parents returned home from vacation was going to be a big one. With palpable excitement shimmering in their eyes, the girls prepared to share their incredible gift with their parents. They had one more trick up their sleeves, however. For starters, they wanted to throw their parents off the scent by surprising them with a visit from eldest sister, Heather. Heather drove over to the house, with a camera set outside, so she could greet her parents as they pulled in.

An Enticing Introduction “We’re so nervous,” whispered Hollie into the camera. As the girls watched their parents pulling into the driveway, they began filming for the final moments of their parents Christmas gift. However, when all was said and done, the girls decided to use part of this sequence as the opening to the video they would eventually post on YouTube. The girls scurried between the camera and the window, watching to make sure they caught their parents on time.

Uncovering Hidden Treasure Geocaching may not be the most common of family activities, even though there are millions of people who engage in the treasure hunt worldwide. The advent of smartphones that come equipped with GPS has lessened some of the fun of the search. The idea behind geocaching is that someone in the community will hide a little trinket somewhere in the world, only sharing the coordinates with the public. Those in the area would then put in the coordinates in order to uncover their little piece of treasure.

Off The Trail Karen and Chip Schoonover pulled into their driveway feeling refreshed from their week away, but immediately, they knew something felt different. As they left the car, Karen stood, inspecting the yard, trying to put her finger on what had changed when her four daughters walked out of the house together. Karen and Chip had only expected three. “Hey! Hey! What are you doing here!” Karen exclaimed to Heather. Both parents were overcome with surprise and joy at seeing their daughter home.

Judging A Book By Its Cover Karen could see that there was a noticeable difference in the facade of her house, prompting her to ask her kids, “Alright, who cleaned?” Seeing Heather standing with her three sisters was more than Karen could have hoped for, though she had also secretly wished the girls might have tidied up things inside too. From how things looked on the outside, Karen could see their cleaning had likely gone beyond what she’d expected, but she didn’t know just how much they’d really done.

It’s Not Over Yet As the girls had planned, Heather was going to tell their parents, “Your surprise isn’t over yet” before leading them inside to see the work they’d done. Neither Karen nor Chip could fathom what had occurred in the week they’d been away. The girls advised their mother to “take a deep breath” before leading both parents inside of the newly renovated house. Karen and Chip stepped through the threshold and proceeded to have their minds completely blown.

Cards On The Table Karen’s jaw dropped. “What!” she shrieked. As she took in the house around her, she felt like she had stepped into a completely different world. “What did you do!” The surprise in her voice couldn’t be contained, as Karen brought her hands to her mouth while continuing to make her way through the renovated house. It wasn’t just clean as she had hoped, her daughters had completely updated the kitchen. Karen couldn’t fathom how much more was in store.

Rewards Of A Challenge Karen and Chip stepped from the entryway into the kitchen, and Karen quickly found herself overwhelmed by emotion. Tears streaming down her face, she marveled at the sleek new look her daughters had designed for their kitchen. They had painted the walls a comforting, pale blue while accenting it with striking brown cabinets. They’d even managed to replace the old countertops with gleaming slabs of polished marble. The girls insisted there was still more to see.

Dining In Style Karen took off her glasses in order to wipe away the tears, while simultaneously walking into the dining room. She had never even considered that her daughters would give her such a gift, as she could see that their hard work had also extended to the other common areas of the house. The change was astounding. The girls giggled and cried alongside their mother, feeling pride in all they had accomplished, and still she hadn’t seen what they did to the rest of the house.

Updating Their Comfort The girls led their parents into the master bedroom, excited to show that they had taken care of every single detail. Karen practically danced into the room, feeling the soft carpeting give way under her feet. Chip stood at the doorway in shock, hardly daring to breathe as he took in the huge change. Karen might have been effusive, but Chip was stoic in his surprise, staring at each new discovery with his jaw nearly hitting the floor.

Shining With Gratitude The Schoonover parents could hardly understand what had prompted their daughters to embark on such an intense transformation mission. No stone had been left unturned. Even the master bathroom had been redone, from the tub and shower to the fresh coat of paint that the girls applied. They even made sure they updated all of the accouterments that went with the decor of each room. To Karen and Chip’s surprise, they hadn’t seen the last of it.

An Open Invitation Karen and Chip were still in shock when the girls ushered them out of their bedroom and into the guest bedrooms. They had beautifully made it up in the same style and color scheme as the rest of the house. Like with the other rooms, the bedsheets, comforters, and curtains were all new. The astonished parents could help but feel pride that they’d raised such thoughtful daughters. It was clear they had put in not only an extensive amount of time but also money.

Looking Ahead As the video that the girls took of the transformation comes to a close, they explain to their shocked parents that they wanted to give them the best Christmas present they had ever received. It’s clear, especially from the before and after pictures, that the girls had taken on an extraordinary project for themselves. Karen and Chip were pleased to not only have received a new home, but to see just what incredible young women their daughters had become.

The Internet Takes Note Shortly after the surprise was revealed, Hollie added the video of their renovation to her YouTube account. It was the first video she had ever posted, but it didn’t go unnoticed. Little by little, the views began to climb, as first hundreds, then thousands of people began tuning in to see the girls’ story. Within a few months, the girls had garnered nearly 115 thousand views on the video of their Christmas surprise. The moment was not going to stop there.

Discovering Their Fame Hollie may have dreamed of getting her name out there, but she never expected it would be because she and her sisters gave their parents such a special Christmas gift. As the video she posted wormed its way around the world, many wanted to help share their incredible story. Unbeknownst to Haley, Hollie, Heather, and Halice, their video was going viral, and with it, their story. The girls couldn’t have been more excited to see how many people they were reaching.

Seeing It In Print It was Haley who caught wind of just how far their story spread when she happened to see her and her sisters when she was scrolling through her Facebook feed and suddenly stumbled upon a picture of her and her sisters. She knew immediately that someone had seen their video, and couldn’t wait to share the article with the rest of her family and friends who had been such an integral part of their big surprise.",Parents Return Home & Find Their Daughters Doing The Unthinkable
"It has a ""G"" and a ""C"" in it. ",https://www.gamebyte.com/gamecubes-logo-has-a-secret-message-and-people-are-only-just-noticing/,"Did you see this?

People are only just noticing a secret message in Gamecube’s logo, and to be honest it’s blowing our minds.

So as we all know, it’s a very recognisable logo. It’s a cube – cute, right?

Well did you notice that it also incorporates a ‘G’ and a ‘C’? Yup, that’s correct. For Gamecube. Similar to Homer Simpson having an ‘M’ in his hair and a ‘G’ in his ear for writer Matt Groening.

Take a look…

The purple is the ‘G’ and the negative space is the ‘C’. Clever.

Fans have also noticed something really odd about the Nintendo Switch logo, and once you see it – it can’t be unseen.

As you can see, this is the logo we’ve grown to know and love…

Can you spot what’s off about it? I’ll be honest, I had no idea. But take a look at these tweets…

Twitter user David Hellman wrote: “Did you notice the Switch logo is not symmetrical? Each side has a different apparent visual weight, so the logo is “balanced” by eye…”

It turns out that this is quite common, as the human eye perceives things differently to how they actually look. For example, the Spotify pause button…

As reported by ShortList, CarolWendelson said: “It was probably aligned optically. Graphic designers will usually do this if something looks off when aligned ‘correctly’. I typically have to do this more with text than objects but this is super common.”

And boniqmin added: “These things are usually intentional. Instead of being geometrically precise, they go for what looks most satisfying to the eye. There was a popular post a while ago when the nintendo switch was announced; the logo was asymmetric in all kinds of ways. When someone made a version of the logo that was perfectly measured out, it looked really odd even though its design was more consistent.”

And the new Google logo isn’t a perfect circle either.

The designers said: “The Google G’s… circular shape was optically refined to prevent a visual ‘overbite’ at the point where the circular form meets the crossbar.”",Gamecube’s Logo Has A Secret Message And People Are Only Just Noticing
She put it back in the water. ,https://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/woman-noticed-baby-dolphin-struggling-beach/,"A baby dolphin beached on Seapoint Beach in Ireland was lucky to be found by a fearless animal lover. Jenni Hänninen, originally from Finland and now living in the Irish city of Drogheda, was horse-riding with her friends on the beach when she suddenly noticed the young animal lying on the sand, clearly agitated and helpless.

The incredible rescue was captured on camera. Jenni told Independent.ie, “When I was younger I might have saved a couple of birds but nothing like this.”

“I just saw the first baby dolphin at the side of the water. I didn’t know who to call or if I should call the coastguard or someone.”

“So I went over to help and when I was coming back there was another one which was stranded as well. I didn’t even know they existed on the east coast.”

Thanks to the woman’s quick decision to step in and put the dolphin back in the water, the animals survived the dangerous beaching and went happily back into their ocean home, hopefully never to be in a similar situation and require rescue ever again.

Rescuing wildlife can save the animal’s life, but it should always be carried out responsibly, with extreme caution, and in a way that will not put the rescuer or animal in danger. Remember that you should always try to contact a professional before stepping in. For emergencies involving marine animals, check out a few marine animal rescue hotlines here.

What is Game of Thrones about?

Game of Thrones is based on George R.R. Martin’s epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire. The books are renowned for the detail with which they describe the fantasy world of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

Martin based many segments of the book on British medieval history. Anyone familiar with Scottish medieval history, for example, may notice the similarities between one of the show’s most famous episodes, ‘The Red Wedding’ and the infamous ‘Black Dinner’, which took place in Scotland in 1440.

The resulting fantasy world sees bleak medieval-style plot lines mixed with more typical fantasy. For example, dragons, giants and undead creatures all exist, but many characters in the Seven Kingdoms have no real contact with them and live a life comparable to that of a medieval peasant.

The plotline follows a number of ‘houses’ who control the Seven Kingdoms, under the rule of the King or Queen, who rules from Kings Landing.

One of the houses followed most closely by the twisting, eight season plot, is House Stark. The leader of their house holds the title ‘The Warden of the North’ and their relatively Spartan existence is contrasted with the monarch ruling the capital, King’s landing. This creates the idea of a north-south divide in the Seven Kingdoms and many other effective political divisions are created and developed throughout the series.

How many seasons of Game of Thrones are there?

There are eight seasons of Game of Thrones, totaling 73 episodes.

Where was Game of Thrones filmed?

Filming locations spanned Northern Ireland, Croatia, Malta, Gozo and even Los Angeles.

Dubrovnik, in Croatia, became a key shooting location from series two onwards as it became the capital, King’s Landing. Game of Thrones tours are now a popular tourist attraction in the city. Castle Ward, in Northern Ireland, as well as Doune Castle, in Scotland, were both used as shooting locations for Winterfell, home of the Stark’s, and have attracted similar series tourism to the region.

Who is in the cast of Game of Thrones?

Many of the stars of Game of Thrones were relatively unknown before their parts in the series but have gone on to more starring roles since. One exception to this was the already very well-known, Sean Bean, who plays Ned Stark in season one.

Richard Madden (The Bodyguard) plays his son, Robb. His daughters, Sansa and Arya, were played by Sophie Turner (Dark Phoenix) and Maisie Williams (Early Man). Bran and Rickon Stark are played by Isaac Hempstead-Wright and Art Parkinson, and Ned’s illegitimate son, Jon Snow, is played by series lead Kit Harrington (How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, Gunpowder).

Also prominent are Alfie Allen, Joe Dempsie, Iwan Rheon, Gwendoline Christie, Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Over the series of eight seasons many characters come and go and Game of Thrones became infamous for killing off central characters.

Who wrote Game of Thrones?

Game of Thrones is based on a series of books by American author, George R.R. Martin. They are entitled, A Song of Ice and Fire. However, in the final series of the programme, the plot of the television series managed to overtake the existing plot of the books, as Martin was still working on the last book of the series, it is not yet released. This led to series writers having to develop the plot themselves and their ending was met with widespread criticism.

Martin told The Observer: “I don’t think [the TV series] was very good for me… The very thing that should have speeded me up actually slowed me down. Every day I sat down to write and even if I had a good day… I’d feel terrible because be thinking: ‘My God, I have to finish the book. I’ve only written four pages when I should have written 40.”

In its final episode, Game of Thrones upset many fans with a controversial ending, which quickly led to a petition to re-write the final season. Over a million signatures were collected and the series’ stars were forced to rush to the writing team’s defence. George R.R. Martin has since stated that the ending of his books will be different to that of the TV series.

It means someone is actively typing. ,https://gizmodo.com/what-the-someone-is-typing-bubbles-in-messaging-apps-ac-1827744443,"Whether it’s a series of blinking ellipsis or an explicit notification that “someone’s typing,” the messaging feature known as a typing indicator is both a useful tool and a source of anxiety for many people. But knowing more about how it works can at least limit the guessing games that cause us stress.

Advertisement

“Hi,” your boss types in the Slack DM, and then appears to type for 10 minutes. What the hell are they typing? What’s happening? Did they just type a sentence and walk away and this damned thing is continuously reassuring you that you’re definitely getting fired? Maybe.

Or, your significant other types, “we need to talk,” and the typing indicator keeps popping up and disappearing. Are they adding on to a thought? Are they constantly erasing what they just said, so they can say, “I’m just not into you” with the cleanest execution possible? Probably.

Like many people who work in an office these days, my interactions with co-workers are almost entirely relegated to Slack, a popular team messaging app. Outside of work, I use different messaging apps to keep up with friends and loved ones, and I’m allergic to phone calls. Someone is always typing. And like most people, I don’t think much about it unless it’s one of those potentially consequential incidents, at which point I turn into a neurotic basket case.

In the interest of limiting my own freak-outs, I reached out to David Auerbach, a software engineer and author who started as an intern at Microsoft when he was 22-years-old and joined the company full time in 1999. He was assigned to the team working on MSN Messenger Service, and he helped build the first typing indicator into a major product. (Auerbach last year became the subject of a controversy involving Breitbart, which he characterized as “obvious bullshit.”)

The first thing I wanted to know was whether Microsoft held a patent on type indicators that everyone else pays to license. Auerbach said that he’s sure there’s some patent out there, but he doubts any other companies are licensing it. “The way tech companies work is that everything gets patented, but it’s rarely enforced—it’s more of a mutually assured destruction mechanism,” he explains. The idea being that if Microsoft went to Facebook demanding it pay up for one patent, Facebook would just counter with one of its own patents that Microsoft is violating. Just last year, Microsoft patented a new “enhanced” typing indicator with some minor cosmetic changes. And there are all sorts of tiny, little patents related to keyboard inputs that would probably grind the tech world to a halt if they were rigorously enforced.

When Microsoft’s engineers first elected to add a typing indicator to Microsoft Messenger Service, it was at a time when the protocols of adapting real-world communication were still up in the air and emojis were still years away. But the notification served a more practical purpose than just humanizing communication: It let you know that the person you were speaking to was still on the line. “Back when it was a dial-up connection, someone could appear online that was actually disconnected because the disconnect wouldn’t register for a while,” Auerbach told me. This keep-alive mechanism just gave users another signal that they can rest easy that they weren’t speaking into the void. It was more a source of comfort than nervous anticipation.

Of course, the world in which we live today brings an assumption that everyone is connected all the time. We may shrug and give it a pass when someone says, “hey, sorry I just got this,” two days after we sent them a text, but we know they saw it far earlier. Still, more people using chat online means there’s a greater need for a traffic cop, and that’s where typing indicator’s serve their most valuable function today. When 1o people are in a group chat or 100 coworkers are communicating in a single Slack channel, the indicator lets us know that we might want to reconsider interrupting others.

In the case of Microsoft’s early implementation of the feature, Auerbach’s memory is a little fuzzy on how it exactly worked, but he believes the notification that someone was typing would be triggered on the first keystroke and repeat as more keystrokes occurred. If no keystrokes were registered after five or 10 seconds, the indicator would no longer be displayed on the other end. As far as he can remember, that was the only function—a user was either typing or not typing—and the addition of “Jane has entered text” came later.

For the most part, notifying users that someone has “entered text”—meaning, they wrote something but might not be actively typing—isn’t as widely used today as it was in the mid-aughts. Which also leads to the question of whether a service is simply saying someone’s typing when they merely entered text and stopped. We can’t say definitively that no service uses such an idiotic system today, but it’s highly unlikely. Not only would that be annoying, but back in Auerbach’s days at Microsoft, the team estimated that 95 percent of the messages flowing through the servers were just that constant repetition that someone was typing. Only 5 percent of the messages were actually the finalized communication being sent to a user.



Unfortunately, the fact that every service isn’t jumping off of Microsoft’s template means that everyone tends to tailor their typing indicators a little differently. It would probably take more time to explain the ways in which every messaging service offered by Google handles the feature than anyone would want to read. But just to take one example, Slack sent us a basic rundown of how its particular approach to typing indicators works:

Slack sends the typing indicator to you when a user is doing the following: Typing (as soon as they start typing, but not if they have only clicked in the text box)



When they are not issuing a slash command (ie. starting their input with /)



When they are not issuing keyboard shortcuts (ie. cmd+[ to switch channels or up arrow to edit)

If a user stops typing for 5 seconds, Slack removes the indicator that they are typing. Slack shows the following message templates in the indicator:

“Jane is typing” (one user)

“Jane and John” are typing (two users)

“Several people are typing” (three or more users) - fun fact on this, Slack’s blog

Advertisement

It’s also worth noting that you can turn typing indicators off in Slack.

As for other platforms, they seem to work in much the same way. Facebook wasn’t quite as detailed in their response but Messenger’s typing indicator is pretty simple Hany Barakat, Engineering Manager at Messenger, told us.

You will only see the typing indicator when a person is actively typing, so it won’t show up if someone has simply entered the text box and might not actively be engaging with the conversation.



It will no longer appear once the person stops typing.



Our tests showed that the typing indicator shows up immediately in Messenger as soon as a single character is entered, even if that character is a space, and the indicator disappears 5-1o seconds later if no more characters are entered.

Advertisement

Apple didn’t respond to our request for info, but our own informal test showed that iMessage’s typing indicator appears as soon as a single character is typed, and spaces without any characters activate it. It takes five seconds to disappear if you clear the text field and 60 seconds to go away if you simply stop typing. It also pops up if you load a picture without sending.

Auerbach doesn’t particularly have regrets about the typing indicator but understands that it’s come to have a different place in our stressful multi-tasking lives. He does believe that every service should make it an option that can be shut off, and it definitely shouldn’t be included on every messaging platform. “That’s one thing I can think of that would make Twitter even worse,” he deadpans. For the love of god, Twitter, don’t get any ideas.

Wildfire smoke in Siberia. ,https://www.iflscience.com/environment/locals-baffled-as-the-sun-disappears-for-three-hours-in-siberia/,"The sky went dark for about three hours on Friday, July 20. The Siberian Times

Parts of Siberia experienced a bit of a bizarre phenomenon last week, when the Sun completely disappeared for several hours.

The incident took place in the Russian republic of Yakutia (also called Sakha), home to some of the coldest cities in the world, notes Live Science, with less than two hours of sunlight in the winter. In early July, they get up to 24 hours of sunlight, down to about 20 hours by mid-July.

So locals in the districts of Eveno-Bytantaisky and Zhigansky were reportedly a bit dismayed when the Sun disappeared for about three hours in the middle of the day on Friday, July 20.

“The sun went out around 11am, and didn’t come back until about 2pm,” one resident said, reported The Siberian Times. “I couldn’t see a thing without switching lights on. We took torches to walk outside, but actually no-one wanted to be on the street because the feeling was as if something heavy in the air was pressing on your chest.”

The sky went dark for about three hours on Friday, July 20. The Siberian Times

When the Sun eventually returned, everything had been covered in a thick layer of dust. The obvious culprit appears to be the wildfires raging elsewhere in Siberia. These have been burning across a huge area about twice the size of Houston. Some of the smoke from these fires even reached Canada.

While that explanation might seem pretty obvious, that didn’t stop some rather bizarre conspiracy theories from sprouting up. In another story on The Siberian Times, locals thought the dark sky might have been caused by everything from a US satellite to, yes, UFOs. Some people apparently even thought it was an unreported solar eclipse, which is literally impossible, while others blamed “devilry”.

It looks like wildfires were probably the culprit. The Siberian Times

We hate to rain on the conspiracy parade, but this was almost definitely the result of wildfires and not some unknown phenomenon. It’s currently wildfire season in Siberia, with hundreds of fires having burned thousands of acres of forest since May, watched by NASA satellites.

Still, it did make for some rather impressive photos. And when you’ve been waiting all year for prolonged sunshine and temperatures to rise, it’s probably a bit annoying when it suddenly disappears for a few hours.

The ability to think creatively. ,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/the-skill-mark-cuban-and-elon-musk-say-is-critical-to-success.html,"Research shows that one million U.S. jobs are expected to disappear by 2026 and one-third of U.S.workers could be jobless by 2030 — all due to automation.

And workers in the U.S. are ill-prepared for this impending shift, says billionaire investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. In an interview with Bloomberg TV, he warns that jobs that are currently viewed as safe could be displaced in a matter of years.

To remain competitive in the future job market, Cuban says that employees will need one critical skill: the ability to think creatively.

“I personally think there’s going to be a greater demand in 10 years for liberal arts majors than there were for programming,” Cuban tells Bloomberg.

Why? Because when the data is already being “spit out” for you in industries like finance or tech, he says, companies will want employees who are “freer thinkers” and can bring a “different perspective” to the information.

SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk holds a similar view. When seeking innovative and creative solutions to large scale problems, Musk asks that his employees use the first principles method, in which you boil information down to it's most basic idea and ""reason up"" from there.","Mark Cuban says this skill will be critical in 10 years, and Elon Musk agrees"

These Two Years Are Officially the Happiest of Your Life

By Andrew Polikarpov / Freestockpro

Esme Benjamin Wellness Editor 25 October 2017 View

When you reflect on your life are there certain years that stick out as particularly joy-filled? The year you could legally order yourself a cocktail? Your time at university? When you finally got your dream job? Researchers have discovered that happiness peaks at two points in life, and even though one might be behind you, the other is yet to come.

The Centre of Economic Performance at the London School of Economics and Political Science interviewed 23,000 German adults aged 17–85, quizzing them on their life satisfaction and asking them to predict how happy they envisioned being in five years time. That exact time later, those same people were re-interviewed to see if the reality matched their expectations.

What the team discovered was a happiness U-curve between ages 20 and 70, with joy peaking at 23 and 69. Twenty-three is typically an age when we’re full of momentum and optimism about the future, which makes it the more predictable of the two, perhaps. Sixty-nine, however, is possibly an age when the stresses of the unknown are behind us and we can enjoy the fruits of our labor, both professional and personal.",These Two Years Are Officially the Happiest of Your Life

"Loneliness, sitting, sleep loss, tanning, and poor diet. ",https://www.sciencealert.com/5-little-known-things-that-are-deadly-as-smoking-lonely-sitting-tanning-science,"Cigarette smoking, one of the least healthy habits out there, is quickly disappearing in the United States. The rate of American adults who smoke has declined from 42 percent in 1965 to 15 percent in 2015.

However, there are a number of risk factors taking its place, many of which stem from people's growing preference for sedentary, isolated lifestyles. As smoking makes its exit in the US, here are the risk factors science says to keep an eye on.

Loneliness

The growth of social media and waning in-person contact has led Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to label loneliness a worldwide epidemic. And it could be lethal.

Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, has found in her research that loneliness reduces people's life spans by the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Sitting

Sitting all day increases risk for a raft of different cancers, a 2014 study found.

Researchers included in their meta-analyses - the gold-standard for research - data from four million people involving how often they sat to watch TV, do work, and commute.

Each two-hour increase in sitting time upped people's risks for colon, endometrial, and lung cancers, regardless of whether they still exercised during the day.

Sleep loss

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called sleep deprivation a public health problem, as some 50 to 70 million people in the US have sleep or wakefulness disorder.

Professor Valery Gafarov, of the World Health Organisation, noted in 2015 that insufficient sleep raises the risk of stroke and heart attack to similar degrees as regular cigarette use.

""Poor sleep should be considered a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease along with smoking, lack of exercise, and poor diet,"" he said.

Tanning

Indoor tanning may seem like a more controlled version of regular sunbathing, but both are potentially more dangerous than smoking.

In 2014, researchers published a study in JAMA that found indoor tanning alone led to more cases of skin cancer than smoking did with lung cancer.

""Given the large number of skin cancer cases attributable to indoor tanning, these findings highlight a major public health issue,"" the investigators wrote.

Poor diet

A wealth of evidence has found that sugary, processed foods high in saturated fats can expose people to potentially fatal diseases at similar, if not greater, rates than smoking.

In 2016, researchers studying the mortality risks from poor diet concluded the death rates exceeded those of alcohol, drugs, unprotected sex, and tobacco combined.

There's not enough funding. ,https://www.unilad.co.uk/science/astronaut-explains-depressing-reason-weve-never-been-back-to-the-moon,"Getty

This past Friday marked 50 years since man first walked on the moon, it was the pinnacle of human achievement and yet despite landing 12 people up there, doing some experiments, dropping some flags, grabbing some rocks and playing a bit of golf no one has been back since December 1972.

That’s a long time between rounds, and in the 45 years since, there are plenty of reasons to go back. A moon base could be the perfect space-based petrol station for further exploration of deep space, make trips to Mars a little more bearable and, well, how cool would it be to go on your holidays and look down on everyone on Earth.

Advert 10

Taking just three days to reach it’s not even that much more of a stretch than a long-haul flight to the other side of the planet or a drive across the UK to the West Country.

Astronaut Chris Hadfield, the first Canadian to walk in space and a man who has played the International Space Station guitar, told Business Insider:

A permanent human research station on the moon is the next logical step. It’s only three days away. We can afford to get it wrong and not kill everybody. And we have a whole bunch of stuff we have to invent and then test in order to learn before we can go deeper out.

Advert 10

But the very simple restraints of inventing some stuff and not killing everyone are not the only hurdles standing in the way of again playing among the stars. It all comes down to the classic issue that rears its head in most situations. Money.

Wikipedia

As much as a same day cross country train ticket can cost roughly the same as a package city break in Europe, space travel doesn’t come cheap. And while a billionaire sits in the Oval Office and has plans to get astronauts to ‘the vicinity of the moon’ sometime in 2023, the nature of politics itself hangs over future trips to the moon and back.

Hadfield added:

Advert 10

Why would you believe what any president said about a prediction of something that was going to happen two administrations in the future? That’s just talk.

Even the most trustworthy of politicians would have a hard time negotiating such a bigly conundrum, and that would be if the money was there to be spent. NASA’s budget is a fraction of what it was during the space race of the 1960s.

NASA

Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham said in a congressional testimony in 2015:

Advert 10

NASA’s portion of the federal budget peaked at 4% in 1965. For the past 40 years it has remained below 1%, and for the last 15 years it has been driving toward 0.4% of the federal budget.

Add to that President Trump’s ever-changing positions – he first called for a return to the moon and then a trip to Mars – with cancellations of programmes creating a loss of about $20 billion.

In 2005 a NASA report estimated a trip to the moon would cost approximately $104bn ($133bn today adjusted for inflation). The Apollo programme cost around $120bn in today’s money.

Advert 10

Cunningham said:

Manned exploration is the most expensive space venture and, consequently, the most difficult for which to obtain political support.

Scientific American reports he added:

Unless the country, which is Congress here, decided to put more money in it, this is just talk that we’re doing here. NASA’s budget is way too low to do all the things that we’ve talked about doing here this afternoon.

But as NASA faces budgetary restraint, there is hope from the private sector in the form of billionaires such as Elon Musk with SpaceX and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and his secretive aerospace company Blue Origin.

Jeffery Hoffman, an astronaut with over 1,200 hours in space and 21.5 million miles travelled under his belt, told a roundtable this year:

There’s this generation of billionaires who are space nuts, which is great. The innovation that’s been going on over the last 10 years in spaceflight never would’ve happened if it was just NASA and Boeing and Lockheed. Because there was no motivation to reduce the cost or change the way we do it. There’s no question: If we’re going to go farther, especially if we’re going to go farther than the moon, we need new transportation. Right now we’re still in the horse-and-buggy days of spaceflight.

Trademark issue. Any business using Kentucky in its name has to pay fees to the state. ,https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/the-real-reason-kfc-changed-its-name-from-kentucky-fried-chicken/,"The fried chicken chain had a simple reason to change its name—and it's not what you've probably heard.

It’s no secret that KFC sells addictive fried chicken to the masses cooked with a special pressure fryer and a “secret” 11 spice and herb blend. But, the company has changed its name to and from “Kentucky Fried Chicken” over the years—and has sparked numerous conspiracy theories as to why.

One of those popular theories (that has been proven false!) is that KFC was forced to change their name because of the word “chicken.” Rumors that the brand was reportedly using “mutant” chemically engineered birds sparked this wacky idea. Outside of chicken conspiracy theories, the company claimed publicly that the name change from Kentucky Fried Chicken to KFC was to shy away from the word “fried” for potential health-conscious patrons. Find out the things your fast food worker isn’t telling you.

The real reason KFC changed its name from Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1991? It all happened because of a trademark issue.

Here’s what actually went down: First, the Commonwealth of Kentucky trademarked its name in 1990. Kentucky was capitalizing on the various brands and products using their name to alleviate debt—and this included the fast-food fried chicken chain. Thus, anyone using “Kentucky” for their business would first need the state’s permission and would also be required to pay licensing fees. Kentucky Fried Chicken rebranded to KFC instead.

Other companies and products followed suit and also changed their names. For example, “The Kentucky Derby” became “The Run for the Roses.” Neil Diamond’s song “Kentucky Woman” no longer played on the radio due to the newly imposed fee.

That said, in November 2016, KFC and the State of Kentucky settled over the use of the trademarked word “Kentucky,” with the chain then announcing they would resume their old name. Now, read about the secret that makes KFC’s fried chicken so crispy.

In the U.S., weddings cost an average of $33,900 in 2019, including all the expenses related to the engagement ring, ceremony and reception, according to the latest Real Weddings study from The Knot.

That's just $31 less than the average cost of a wedding in 2018, and a significant drop from 2016 when couples spent $35,309 on average. This trend toward spending less has to do with the fact that people are becoming more cost-conscious about wedding planning, The Knot says.

A majority of couples (69%) think budgeting is one of the most important elements when planning a wedding, second only to guest experience, the study finds. ""With [the average] couple covering nearly half of [their] wedding costs, they're much more likely to prioritize and allocate budget to wedding details they find to be the most important while saving money on the rest,"" Kristen Maxwell-Cooper, editor-in-chief of The Knot, tells CNBC Make It.

Deciding which components to have at your wedding is a highly personal decision. ""A foodie couple may prioritize unique experiential catering options, while a music-obsessed couple may splurge on a well-known DJ or standout band,"" Maxwell-Cooper says.

When narrowing down your wedding must-haves, it's helpful to know that more than 50% of people who married in the past 10 years agree that spending on the bride's dress, the wedding cake and photography were worth the money, a 2019 survey from Novi Financial Inc found.

Canadian woman plans to sue nephew after refusing to split her winnings / Fox 4

A Canadian family bitterly divided by a C$1.23 million (NZ$1.43) lottery win have finally reached an agreement on how to split the cash.

But not everyone is convinced the outcome is fair.

News.com.au first reported on the story in July, when 19-year-old Tyrone MacInnis and his aunt Barbara Reddick discovered they had both won the top prize in the Margaree Chase the Ace lottery.

They were both awarded a giant novelty cheque bearing both their names in front of reporters — as both names had been written on the winning ticket.

The cash was split by lottery organisers down the middle, with each scoring NZ$671,500.

But moments after they were pictured with their prize, Ms Reddick, who lives in the small town of Margaree Forks in Nova Scotia, turned to her nephew and uttered four brutal words: ""See you in court.""

From that moment on, the pair were engaged in a nasty public feud.

Ms Reddick argued she never agreed to split the money with the teen, claiming she had only transferred him C$100 to buy the tickets on her behalf, and asked him to include his name on the ticket for ""good luck"", according to The Telegraph in the UK.

The CBC network reported the 57-year-old as saying her nephew ""didn't deserve"" the cash.

""He's dead to me,"" she said at the time.

""I bought the ticket. Now he's trying to lie and say I said 'split' the winnings.

""I put his name on the ticket for good luck because he's like a son to me — he was. He was lucky, but not for half a million dollars. Tyrone is getting nothing from me.""

Ms Reddick contacted her lawyers, and last month, Supreme Court judge Patrick Murray froze half of the winnings — Mr MacInnes's share — while the dispute was dealt with.

Now, it has been revealed the family has finally reached an agreement and will avoid court proceedings. Under that agreement, Ms Reddick will pocket the bulk of the winnings — around NZ$1m in total.

It means her nephew will receive just NZ$407,800 — a little more than half the money he was originally awarded.

In a statement emailed to The Globe and Mail, Ms Reddick's lawyer Adam Rodgers said both sides were happy with the result.

""The parties are pleased to announce that they have reached a resolution … They are both satisfied with the terms of the settlement,"" the statement read.

""It was reached mutually in order to avoid further court proceedings and to bring this matter to a final conclusion.

""Both parties are looking forward to putting this matter behind them, and no further media statements will be made.""

But many members of the public claimed Mr MacInnes deserved half the jackpot, with many slamming Ms Reddick for her ""greed"" and ""shameful behaviour"".

After posting a photo of Ms Reddick and Mr MacInnes on Facebook back in July, the lottery's page was flooded with opinions from strangers regarding who was in the right.

""Wow … this is such a sad case why are people so greedy. Just be thankful for what you have,"" one woman posted, while another wrote: ""She is lucky I am not the judge who will be presiding over this case because I would give the kid 75 per cent of the winnings so hopefully he can better his life.""",Canadian man loses portion of jackpot prize following family feud

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria. ,https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/stem-cells-just-finger-prick/,"Stem cells are often all over the media, and sometimes it seems like scientists take one step forward then three steps back within this field. We get excited, then it all goes quiet for a while. But recently some promising new developments have been made which could see a major progression in this field. But why is this particular research any different to anything that's been done before? Well, let's take a look.

Stem cells are like a blank slate; they haven't yet assumed a particular identity. But they have the potential to turn into a different type of specialised cell which can then go on to, for example, build a particular organ. There are two main types of stem cell; embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Since embryonic stem cells are obtained from early-stage embryos there are obviously important ethical considerations and many people disagree with using this type of cell. Therefore many people have focused on adult stem cells instead, which can be obtained from various places in the human body such as the bone marrow. But using bone marrow is extremely invasive, which understandably puts off donors. Scientists have been looking at alternatives, such as using easily obtainable blood samples to generate stem cells from.

When the scientists have obtained such adult cell samples, they need to transform them into a type of cell called human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). These cells, like embryonic stem cells, have the ability to give rise to every cell type found in the body, such as brain cells, heart cells and kidney cells. But they have some advantages over embryonic stem cells, mainly because they are patient-matched; the risk for immune-rejection is therefore abolished. Previously, however, large quantities of blood have been required to do this.

hiPSCs have been successfully induced before; this isn't new. But what a group of researchers have shown in a paper published in Stem Cells Translational Medicine is that they can dramatically reduce the amount of patient blood required to do this. In fact, they have shown that a single finger-prick of blood is enough, and they induced the cells without the need for transgenes. Although the insertion of specific genes (transgenes) into the cells to induce pluripotency (the ability to turn into any other cell type) is generally the most efficient method, the risk of tumour development often outweigh the benefits. This group used a different method called cell reprogramming, and claim that to date this is the most efficient approach in the generation of hiPSCs from human blood samples.

But it doesn't stop there. Alongside proving that they could in fact use even less than a finger-prick's worth of blood, they hope to increase donors with a novel DIY blood-collection kit. This would allow individuals to collect their own samples and then send them off via courier, in a thermo box provided, to various stem cell banks which are currently being set up worldwide. This dramatically increases the number of donors that could be reached; those with mobility issues, perhaps because of physical disabilities or financial problems, and those in remote places. In particular, it could increase access to individuals with certain genotypes or diseases of interest. When the samples reach the banks they would be screened, induced, and then used in numerous applications such as disease modeling and drug screening.

The group, based at A*STAR's Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, successfully demonstrated that the self-collected single drops of blood could be used not only for reprogramming, but blood typing and DNA sequencing also. They also managed to differentiate the reprogrammed cells into functional heart cells. The group hope that this could pave way for the development of a large-scale hiPSC bank, which has great potential for future therapeutic medicine.",Stem Cells From Just A Finger Prick
They are too deep to drill. ,https://www.iflscience.com/environment/more-than-a-quadrillion-tons-of-diamonds-lay-within-the-earth/,"An international team of researchers has used sound waves to estimate the composition of the Earth’s upper mantle and they think that about a quadrillion tons of diamonds are buried somewhere over 160 kilometers (100 miles) deep beneath our feet.

The new research is reported in the journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems and is based on decades of seismic activity data. Seismographers register the waves from all the movements within the Earth, such as earthquakes. They are mechanical waves moving at certain speeds depending on the material they go through.

Based on the data, the researchers have tried to reconstruct what the interior of the Earth is like. And that’s where they stumbled upon something interesting. There are certain areas in which the seismic waves tend to speed up without explanation. These regions are called cratonic roots and are the oldest and most immovable sections of continental tectonic plates. These are sometimes seen as upside-down mountains stretching as deep as 320 kilometers (200 miles).

To explain the seismic data, the team started playing with the possible composition of these roots. They arrived at the conclusion that if these structures contain between 1 and 2 percent diamond, then the speed of the seismic waves makes sense. This might not seem much in terms of the total amount of material in the crust and mantle, but it is 1,000 times more diamonds than expected.

""This shows that diamond is not perhaps this exotic mineral, but on the [geological] scale of things, it's relatively common,"" senior author Dr Ulrich Faul of MIT said in a statement. ""We can't get at them, but still, there is much more diamond there than we have ever thought before.""

""It's circumstantial evidence, but we've pieced it all together,"" Faul added. ""We went through all the different possibilities, from every angle, and this is the only one that's left as a reasonable explanation.""

Diamonds are formed under extremely high-temperature and high-pressure conditions found below Earth’s crust. The reason why they are rare is that they only get close to the surface in specific eruptions that carve out geological pipes made of a rock called kimberlite. A large concentration of them deep below the crust, then, is not too bizarre of a hypothesis.",Scientists Just Found More Than A Quadrillion Tons Of Diamonds On Earth. There's Just One Small Problem

A few days after the party, the photos were posted on Facebook.

""I thought 'That's not me, what a terrible angle,'"" Gemmell, who lives in Perth, Australia, recalled. ""But then another photo was posted — from a worse angle. I kept waiting for a good angle and it never arrived.""

It was September 2012 and after Gemmell took some time to ""feel sorry"" for herself, she got serious about turning her life around. Here are the steps she took to lose 155 pounds in four years.

1. Start exercising — every day.

""I downloaded an app called 5K Runner, it specifically said it would turn anybody from a couch potato into a 5K runner in eight weeks. I thought I would prove the app wrong,"" she said.

Instead, the app proved her wrong and saved her life. At first, she would run for 30 seconds, and even that was a struggle.

""The app encouraged me while I was exercising, and it would beep to remind me to run or walk if the app had been inactive for a couple of days. Before I knew it, I had run a 5K without stopping!""

Gemmell had lost about 40 pounds just by accomplishing her 5K goal!

2. Cut out cheese, pasta, bread and soft drinks.

""I started to change my diet by just cutting out those four specific foods and nothing else,"" Gemmell said. ""It was a massive challenge because at 33, I had a lot of food tendencies that were hard to break.""

3. Realize that quick fixes don't work.

""As soon as you get off of whatever scheme you were on, you'll gain the weight back — and then some,"" Gemmell said. ""I decided that if I'm going to do it, I have to do it 100 percent the right way and take my time.""

4. Celebrate the small things.

For Gemmell, that meant being able to get out of the car without having to swivel her body sideways. She cried the first time she went on a plane and didn't need an extension for the seat belt. She celebrated being able to fit in what she called ""normal people's clothes.""

5. Don't be afraid of anything, especially the gym.

About four months into her journey, Gemmell joined a gym and started doing resistance training workouts. She started seeing definition in her body that she wasn't experiencing from just running.

Today, she runs about three or four days a week, and practices resistance training at the gym five days a week (legs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday; and arms on Tuesday and Thursday).

6. Remember that it's as much mental as it is physical.

Gemmell confessed there are days when she feels like throwing in the towel — at least once every two weeks, but she remembers the challenge is mental, too.

""I struggle to come to terms mentally with what's taking place in my life: My body is constantly changing and my brain is trying to keep up. I still hear the negative things people used to call me in the schoolyard and I still see that girl. But I'm no longer her,"" Gemmel explained.

7. Form one habit, then add another one.

For Gemmell, changing her life wasn't overwhelming because she took it one step at a time.

""I would form one habit, like eight weeks of running, and then start working on another habit,"" Gemmell explained.

Today, Gemmell is at the end of her journey, and is hoping to have surgery to remove the loose skin on her body. Casey Gemmell

8. Find a support system.

For Gemmell, her husband was her No. 1 source of support.

""He supported me 110 percent. He ran beside me every day. At first, I was scared to do it by myself, and he was always by my side,"" Gemmell recounted.

""I hope I continue on this journey and hope to motivate others. There are so many people out there like me, and I want them to know there's hope,"" Gemmell said.

As we head into 2020, many of us are focusing on one thing: how to boost our net worth.

Faced with challenging economic times, the much-warned about threat of recession, basement level interest rates and stagnant wages, many of us are looking for ways to find a few extra dollars.

Luckily, there are a few refreshingly simple ways you can add millions — and potentially even billions of dollars to your bank account.

Dressing like departed Apple deity Steve Jobs, convincing people you're a technology company even when you're clearly not, and good old fashioned breaking the law are just some of the easy ways you can turn your plucky young start-up into a money printing machine, without all the pesky added pressure of actually turning a profit.

But don't just take our advice. Smart people learn from their mistakes, wise ones learn from those of others, so here's a few places to get you started on the path to turning your simple idea into a slightly more complicated idea that venture capitalists will love!

SO YOU WANT TO BE A TECH BILLIONAIRE?

The first thing you'll want to do if you're an aspiring tech billionaire is drop out of whatever university you're currently studying at, preferably Harvard. Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) both famously turned their back on the hallowed campus, although Zuck was almost kicked out before he could drop out. His very normal and classy FaceMash website allowed horny Harvard boys to rate the attractiveness of the women in their classes and he was threatened with expulsion, presumably for violating copyright in using images of the women since there's clearly nothing wrong with the website he made, at face value or with any more forensic a reading.

Zuckerberg moved on from his little perv website to create Facebook, which was already going off when he decided to turn his back on Harvard.

Meanwhile, having already taken an interest in computers in high school (his alma mater Lakeside Prep, one of the top 15 private schools in the United States, was one of the first to get students access to computers), Gates took official leave to focus on starting his company before actually dropping out of Harvard, meaning he could return to one of the world's most prestigious colleges if he failed.

Zuckerberg however would be forced to rely on his parents, a psychiatrist and a dentist, if he fell on hard times, though thankfully that never happened.

Of course, if you don't go to one of the most renowned universities in the world and have parents from wealthy professional backgrounds, you may want to factor this into your SWOT analysis. But really you should have thought of that before you decided to be born into those circumstances, and they should have no bearing on your access to the networks and resources you'll need to attract funding for your tech company.

BUT WAIT, I DON'T RUN A TECH COMPANY?

Where would our society be if people let simple problems like this get in the way?

Just because you've got your heart set on becoming a billionaire tech visionary, doesn't mean you need to have any kind of detailed technical nous. Steve Jobs famously never wrote any code for Apple, at least according to his co-founder Steve Wozniak.

""He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do any original design, but he was technical enough to alter and change and add to other designs,"" Mr Wozniak said answering a 2013 email from the public.

Merely having an opinion and being able to direct another person to realise your vision can be enough.

But what if your company objectively has nothing to do with technology?

Simple, just pretend that it does.

Entrepreneurs in the real estate, fitness, and even hospitality industries are beginning to realise the secret power of manifestation: if you believe you're a visionary tech company, the universe will make it so.

Real estate company WeWork, which sought a US$47 billion valuation as it prepared for a doomed IPO earlier this year, mentioned ""technology"" more than 100 times in its filings with the United States' Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Multiple times that was in reference to the technology ""infrastructure"" in the offices it leases out to young entrepreneurs (possibly even you!).

Does your tech start-up's home office (which preferably will be in your garage rather than your actual home) have an NBN connection? Congratulations, your company is now backed by technology and well on the way to billions in funding.

This also provides another opportunity for you to increase your own personal net worth by turning your company into your customer, much like WeWork founder Adam Neumann did. Neumann bought several commercial properties he then leased back to WeWork to turn into office spaces.

He has since been removed from the company, so there are risks to this strategy, but he was given more than a billion dollars before walking out the door, so there are also rewards.

FAKE IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT

This might seem like a lot to take on initially, so it can be useful to look at a case study of a young entrepreneur who managed to pull off all of the above and more.

Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of (not Harvard but still …) Stanford University to start her healthcare company Theranos when she was barely out of her teens.

The daughter of a vice-president at resources and accounting fraud firm Enron, she had a dream to revolutionise the science of blood testing by producing a small machine capable of running detailed tests on just a few drops of blood.

Using her connections and charm, Holmes managed to attract billions in funding for Theranos, however what she's perhaps most known and mocked for is her mimicry of Steve Jobs.

Holmes regularly copied his black turtleneck uniform, as well as speaking in an artificial baritone voice.

In the wake of her downfall, family members have insisted this voice is her natural one, but at least one former Theranos worker told Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou (whose book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup exists as something of a bible on Theranos' laughable rise and fall) that they'd heard Holmes speaking in a voice several octaves higher than the one she reportedly put on.

While lowering her voice can be taken as another sad example of a woman being forced to adopt male traits to be taken seriously in the tech industry, this doesn't exclude it from being objectively hilarious.

But it wasn't the only lie believed to be spread by the company.

Holmes eventually settled a lawsuit with the SEC the alleged she lied to shareholders about the blood-testing technology being used by the US Department of Defence.

Theranos was also accused of overstating its revenue, claiming it made $100 million in 2014 when it really made 0.1 per cent of that.

Many former workers at Theranos were more than happy to talk to the press about their experience, describing the culture of lying and deception, proving once again that workers do nothing but get in the way of good business, which means if you want to be a tech billionaire, you're going to want to …

EXPLOIT YOUR WORKFORCE

Princeton graduate and frat boy Jeff Bezos was a do-nothing Wall Streeter surely destined for a life of poverty before he came up with the idea that would make him the first man in the world to have more than $US100 billion, for some reason.

Amazon may have started as a little company selling books over the internet, but it has since grown into an eCommerce and web services behemoth.

The company sells pretty much anything, including shonky knock offs of existing products made by the company which appear ahead of the rivals it knocks off in searches on the site.

It also makes speakers powered by digital voice assistants that can offer you all sorts of help around the home and also occasionally send recordings of what goes on around your home to human contractors (the company has since added an option for users to tell this assistant to delete those recordings after being caught out along with Apple, Google, Microsoft and more throughout the past year).

Jeff Bezos has faced criticism for exploiting his workforce at Amazon. Photo / File

Its biggest money spinning division is one of its least talked about: the Amazon web services division that makes up the bulk of its profit.

Amazon is a massive business, and massive businesses require massive workforces.

The best workforces are seemingly ones that are pushed to their physical limits before being disposed of. This is a role best filled by robots, but until it can get those working properly, Amazon appears willing to make do with real life people.

Overwhelming reports from former and current Amazon workers detail a company that constantly monitors their employees and pushes them to the absolute edge, while of course paying them as little as possible.

The enforcement of ""Amazon pace"", described as a mixture between walking and jogging, is just one of the ways this manifests, and worker mistreatment isn't limited to the US. Employees at the Melbourne warehouse told ABC Newsearlier this year they were working under a culture of fear, forced into casual positions they could lose at any moment.

One worker described feeling ""dehumanised"", saying Amazon ""resent the fact that I'm not a robot"".

There is danger in this strategy. If worker morale falls too low, they may make the radical decision to unionise, but there are also ways around this too.

Google, once considered the coolest place in the world to work, has been facing a growing wave of backlash from employees who are beginning to realise that ping pong tables and beanbags aren't the kind of workplace perks you value beyond your early twenties.

As a very smart company run by geniuses, Google has now seemingly decided to start allegedly firing those workers at the core of the union movement within the company.

While we're still waiting to see exactly how this strategy pans out, we're sure it will be another massive success along with things like Google Glass, Wave, Circles, or other names you don't recognise.

And by now you might be thinking, ""wait, isn't suppressing unionisation efforts illegal?""

Not to worry.

When building a billion dollar mega tech corporation of your own, you're going to want to remember the sage advice of disgraced Commonwealth Bank CEO Ian Narev, ""temper your sense of justice"", and quite simply …

BREAK THE LAW

Uber, the rideshare app that touted itself as being the conduit for you to hire ""your own personal driver"" while not actually hiring any drivers of its own, experienced a meteoric rise this decade.

Part of this meteoric rise involved an aggressive expansion to all corners of the globe, frequently coming into areas formerly dominated by traditional taxi companies and disrupting them with its cheaper rides and tech powered booking system.

This expansion required routinely ignoring the rules and regulations around personal transport in many jurisdictions until they were eventually changed to favour them.

Uber has faced legal pressure across a number of countries. Photo / File

While arguments can be made that these laws were outdated and in need of updating anyway, this excuse won't work for your average marijuana dealer so they shouldn't work for billion dollar tech companies either.

Regardless of how they did it, Uber has now been allowed to stay and continue operating in most of the markets it forced its way in to.

Now if the company could finally turn over even one measly dollar in profit the venture capital investors that have been subsidising our cheap rides for the past five years can be happy.

That probably won't happen until self-driving cars (which will require further regulatory updates) reach maturity, which will finally allow Uber to replace its quasi-workforce of contracted drivers with … you guessed it: robots.

NOW IT'S YOUR TURN

By now you should be well equipped to handle all the challenges running a business could throw at you, so let's get active! Ditch that degree. Pull on that turtleneck. It's time to move fast and break things, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and begin a systematic process of lying, deceiving, or otherwise cheating your way to becoming a billionaire.

If that fails you could always try investing in the next Bitcoin.

A giant Alaskan Malamute. Saved you 41 clicks. ,https://www.icepop.com/woman-adopt-a-pet-alaskan-malamute/,"instagram.com

Yumna Saloojee, a South African woman, couldn’t wait to adopt a pet. When she set her eyes on the most adorable little Alaskan malamute dog, she knew he was the one and couldn’t wait to bring him home. She always wanted a furry companion to call her very own best friend and was excited at the prospect of providing a loving home for a special little puppy. After a few months, Yumna started noticing a drastic transformation in her beautiful pooch, which left her totally baffled. Read here to find out what Yumna discovered after deciding to adopt her malamute puppy.

1. Choosing To Adopt a Pet

Usually, one of the biggest factors people take into account when choosing to adopt a pet is the size of the animal. In 2014, Yumna Saloojee from South Africa knew she wanted to adopt a dog, but size wasn’t something she really pondered over…not until something quite interesting and unexpected happened. She would have been happy with just about any kind of dog!

Big pets are fun to have around, but come with slightly more challenges and responsibilities. They require significantly more space and can be hard to handle at times. Small pets, on the other hand, are more convenient and easier to groom for the most part. Nevertheless, some people just want more to hug and cuddle with, so a bigger dog seems fun. Ultimately, it’s a personal choice depending on what you are looking for in an animal. For one woman in particular, she had her eyes set on a cute little puppy.

2. A New Furry Friend

Yumna had made the decision that it was time to finally make her dream come true, take the leap, and adopt a pet. She had been dreaming about it for quite a while and had her heart set on getting a puppy, because all she ever wanted was a furry best friend by her side all the time. Not only that, she finally felt ready to take on the responsibility of looking after a pooch companion. So out she went to find the dog of her dreams.

It did not take too much searching before she stumbled across her soon-to-be best friend: an irresistible little ball of fluff that was an Alaskan malamute. The dog was just a little furball at the time and it was impossible to imagine how much the puppy would grow. Nonetheless, Yumna had met the pup of her dreams, and realized that her life was going to change for good – in more ways than she expected.

3. The One

Yumna was absolutely ecstatic to be able to finally adopt a pet. The fact that the lucky pet would be her very first dog made it even more exciting for her. The process required a bit of searching, but once she laid her eyes on the cutest little Alaskan malamute puppy she had ever seen, her heart melted on the spot.

As soon as Yumna locked eyes with the cute and fluffy malamute, she knew that he was the right dog for her. “I fell in love the second I held him,” she told The Dodo. When she first picked him out, he was only two weeks old. Since he was so young, the dog still needed time to nurse from his mother. For that reason, Yumna had to wait a few weeks before she could bring him home. She could hardly wait for the day to come. And she was incredibly surprised when the day finally came.

4. Home Time

After weeks of waiting to see her precious new pup, the day finally she came when she could pick up her new fur baby. He had already grown quite a bit since the last time she saw him. Yumna had already chosen a name for him: Tydus. The name means “great, giant warrior” and it was extremely popular in ancient Rome, named after a local king. This little dog just had to be destined for great things.

Small and fluffy pooch, he was incredibly loveable and friendly from the get-go, and he already knew he was boss. Nonetheless, Yumna knew what she was getting into when she adopted an Alaskan malamute. She wasn’t particularly looking for a small dog breed and was fully aware that Tydus would grow bigger as he got older. The breed typically grows to quite a substantial size, but as she would soon find out, Tydus was more special than other Mamalutes.

5. Settling In

As soon as Tydus was brought home for the first time, he managed to settle in quite quickly. He was lavished with an array of toys, had a comfy new bed, plenty of food, and tons of attention around-the-clock in his new, loving home. Right off the bat, Tydus discovered his natural love of running around and frolicking in the grass with his toys like nobody’s business. He had so much open space in his new home. As he grew, he would definitely need it!

This cute Alaskan malamute was the little king of the household now and he loved all the joy he was getting at the new home. The little rascal loved to play with Yumna and made tons of human friends when Yumna’s friends and family came over to visit. He was such an active and affectionate puppy that he needed lots of attention. Fortunately, all those who met him were glad to give this growing dog what he wanted!



6. A Natural

Pictured here is Tydus when he was around eight weeks old. He couldn’t have been more adorable. As he explored and learned about the world around him, he discovered his favorite games and seemed to be trying to master the art of playing soccer. Moreover, he made the perfect dog model, always willing to pose for the camera with his photogenic furry face and funny antics.

The moment Tydus was welcomed into his new home, Yumna documented his every waking moment. Anybody would have done the same because, after all, a puppy doesn’t have to do much to look cute. All he had to do here was play with his soccer ball and smile. Little Tydus was also growing very quickly, and she didn’t want to miss a thing before he grew into a full size dog. By the time he was full grown, it would be hard to imagine this was the same dog.

7. Pool Time

Not only did Tydus the Dog have a huge garden to play in, he also had his very own swimming pool at Yumna’s home. Alaskan malamutes enjoy swimming, so she wanted him to get used to being around water as he grew into a bigger puppy. Pictured here is one of the occasions when they were trying to get Tydus acclimated to the pool scene. He seems to be having a nice time!

At this point, Tydus wasn’t quite ready to jump in and get all his fur wet just yet. He was just happy to get close to the pool and be able to play outside in the grass. Of course, Yumna made sure that this moment was documented too with the pooch smiling for the camera. Little Tydus always knew how to pose to get the perfect shot even as he continued to grow at an unbelievable pace.

8. Part of the Pack

It didn’t take long for Yumna and every member of the Saloojee clan to fall in love with Tydus. He was growing cuter and more lovable by the day and Tydus felt like another part of the family. More likely, Tydus now thought they were part of his! The pup never seemed to run out of energy. His favorite activity at this point was playing with all of Yumna’s family members and friends all day long.

His sweet face, adorable black eyes, perfectly fluffed hair, and pudgy little paws made Tydus the most irresistible puppy dog out there. Could he get even cuter? Yumna couldn’t have been happier with her decision to bring this Alaskan malamute beauty home. He was the perfect addition to the family even as he continued to grow day by day. Still, she had no idea what was about to be in store for her.

9. Getting Bigger

As all dog owners know, it is normal for puppies grow significantly bigger as they get older. Because of this, Yumna didn’t suspect anything odd about Tydus’s growth spurts in the beginning. From the day she picked him out, she knew he was going to be a relatively big dog, like most dogs of the Alaskan malamute breed. However, Tydus seemed to be doing things a little bit differently.

No one knew it just yet, but Tydus’s growth spurt starting to take off and surpass other dogs of his age. He continued to grow and grow and grow by the day and was quickly reaching his full-grown size. Yumna was totally besotted with her lovable Alaskan malamute and would love him in any shape, form, or size. But just how big was Tydus going to grow? It would only be a matter of time to find out.

10. Giant Great Warrior

As it turns out, Tydus was fast living up to the meaning of his name: Great Giant Warrior. He continued to grow exponentially as he began to grow from a tiny little thing into a full grown dog. Even though he was still a puppy, he had already reached the weight of a whopping 54 kilograms (120 lbs), which is already huge for an Alaskan malamute. Anyone who had seen Tydus from the start would hardly recognize him now!

The once-tiny pooch was growing into what looked more like a majestic-looking bear or lion. Yumna had no idea Tydus would grow to such a humongous size when she adopted him, but she adored him nevertheless and still thought he was the cutest thing around. Don’t think his big size stopped him from acting like a puppy either. He loved to run, jump and play more than ever, hardly aware of his size. How was she going to tend to such a big dog? For all she knew, he could get even bigger!

11. The Alaskan Malamute

A male Alaskan malamute usually reaches about 35 kilograms (85 lbs), and can stand at 65 centimeters (25 inches) high at the shoulder. In rare cases, the so-called “giant” versions can reach about 64 kilograms (140 lbs), but their bodies are not designed to carry that weight.

Clearly Tydus was way bigger and taller than the average malamute, but no one anticipated he could grow to be the size of a giant malamute when he was still just a puppy. So what exactly did this mean for Yumna?

12. Towering Over

When it comes to hugs, Tydus has never been shy. He loves jumping up to hug Yumna; the only problem is he towers over her with his giant size and all that fluff going on. At two years old, Tydus didn’t look like he was slowing down.

“To be honest, his size comes from all that magical fluff,” Yumna told Get Leashed magazine. “I don’t think he will get any bigger now, and that’s okay. I might get crushed if he does!” The funniest part of it all is that Tydus didn’t seem aware of his own size.

13. Cuddle Buddies

Yumna decided to make some use of all that fluff and fur by cuddling with Tydus every day. Only a giant Alaskan malamute like him could make the best cuddle buddy out there. He loves it so much that he smiles every time!

Even though Tydus outgrew his manageable puppy size very rapidly, Yumna continued to take pictures of her beloved bear all the time, enjoying the gift of having him. Continue reading to find out what happened after she shared her pictures with the world.

14. Overgrown Puppy

Despite his enormous size, Tydus continued to act like a puppy, blissfully unaware of his proportions. He climbed in Yumna’s lap even though he couldn’t fit. In fact, it’s his resemblance to a big bear that made him into more of a sweetheart.

While Yumna and her family got used to Tydus’s size, strangers in the streets started to notice this overgrown pooch and his abundant amount of fur. She feared people might get scared by the sheer size of her dog without knowing his personality, but people proved her wrong.

15. People’s Reactions

Every time Yumna took Tydus out for a walk in the streets to keep him active, he’d grab the attention of everyone who caught a glimpse of him. “His fluffiness is the first thing that catches attention, then his size,” Yumna told The Dodo.

She went on to say, “Wherever we go, even just for a walk around the block, we get stopped and asked about his size, age and most often, ‘What breed is he?’ I guess it’s not often that you see a lion-dog walking the street.” With all this positive attention, Yumna wanted to share her beautiful Alaskan malamute’s beauty with the world, and you won’t believe how!

16. A Social Media Star

Yumna was super excited to share her beautiful Alaskan malamute with the world, so she decided to create his very own Instagram page where she could upload different photos of him every day. She wanted to show off his dazzling personality.

Tydus the dog became a star with over 140,000 followers. “If his looks didn’t get your attention, his personality definitely will,” Yumna said about opening the account. “He has an amazing soul that earns everyone’s affection. He’s a little charmer … or giant charmer.” However, there was one other charmer joining in on the all the attention.

17. Trez, The Congo African Grey Parrot

The Instagram account was created for Tydus and all his shenanigans, but he shares it with his brother Trez, the Congo African Grey Parrot. In fact, the account is called Trez & Tydus, on which Trez the adorable bird often makes random appearances.

Yumna calls Trez “The Ruler of Everything” because of how he enjoys mimicking everyone around the house and sits there looking all regal. Tydus is more of the big friendly giant in the house, but they do play together at times.

18. Picture Perfect

Yumna absolutely adores her animals, especially when they play together and “behave” just long enough to pose for the camera. It seems like Tydus here wants all the attention, and he believes the best way to get it is by “gnawing” off his mother’s arm.

It’s pictures like these that Yumna chooses to share almost every day to capture all the cuteness and love of Tydus the dog. He behaves like an overgrown puppy, goofing around all day. If you think you’ve seen it all, continue reading to see what else this big ball of fur gets up to all the time.

19. Goofing Around

Most of the time Tydus is a serious goofball. He loves to have a romp around with his stuffed toys when he isn’t cuddling Yumna. Here, he is seen having a great time completely ripping poor little Mickey Mouse to pieces.

Well, for such a huge and high-energy Alaskan malamute, Yumna has to make sure he’s always entertained with some kind of activity. Besides for Mickey over here (or what’s left of him), Tydus also has a stuffed monkey he likes to chew to keep himself busy during the day.

20. Hey You, Freeze!

There are a few more favorite toys Tydus likes to play with. He especially loves his stuffed dinosaur and toy gun. We aren’t quite sure what the overgrown pooch is imagining in this situation, but he sure looks content – probably because he beat the dinosaur at a game of cops and robbers.

You might not know it at first glance, but Tydus has a very busy schedule planned out for him all day. When he’s not decimating Mickey Mouse or play-shooting his purple stuffed dinosaur, the malamute has some pretty serious business to take care of.

21. Helping Mama

When Tydus isn’t goofing about, he likes to help his mama Yumna get some work done. Just look at him appearing all sage and wise. He has those airs about him – as if he can advise Yumna about the ways of the world when he isn’t acting like an oversize puppy.

Well the bigger the dog, the bigger the heart, right? No doubt! In Tydus’s case it’s true, and he’s the best companion for all Yumna’s escapades and adventures both inside and outside the house. He also happens to make the best driving partner!

22. Just Cruising Through

When Yumna has places to go and people to see, she takes her big friendly giant Alaskan malamute with her for the ride. Tydus the Dog is just so big that people in traffic won’t want to mess with her.

Another benefit of taking Tydus for the ride is that other drivers might get distracted by his size and beauty and allow her to skip ahead when no one is watching. The love between these two just knows no bounds.

23. Fooling Around

One of Tydus’s favorite things to do is to chase and play wrestle Yumna to the ground. He tends to forget how big he is, and when Tydus starts playing, the fluffy bear of a dog is always in it to win it.

He looks massive next to Yumna, but it’s probably safe to say we wouldn’t mind having a wrestle with Tydus either. We have seriously fallen in love with his one-of-a-kind personality and how adorably unaware he is of his size.

24. Yippeeeeeee!!!

Every time Yumna comes back home, Tydus gets so excited he leaps into the air. He seriously looks like a flying bear. Just look at the smile on his face! Have you ever seen a happier Alaskan malamute in your lives? We certainly haven’t!

This picture pretty much sums up the love between Tydus the dog and his human mama, Yumna. It didn’t take her too long to get used to his huge size. He probably has to eat a whole lot of food, but it’s all worth it for her.

25. True Love

Yumna is so grateful she picked Tydus as her fur baby. She definitely didn’t think she’d be taking care of a giant Alaskan malamute, but his golden personality and his endlessly funny antics have only added to their special relationship.

A lot of the time, Tydus the Dog’s social media fame is associated with another famous dog. Tydus is occasionally having his thunder stolen by a husky-malamute dog named Loki the Wolfdog. He’s been breaking hearts since 2013 and has over 1.7 million Instagram followers.



26. Double Trouble

Tydus is not the only adorable Giant Alaskan Malamute around. This next guy posted a photo of himself with his two giant fur babies on Reddit and people went wild! He captioned the photo saying “My tiny puppies. I gotta get a bigger couch.”

Several people responded to the online poster, known only as Turdman 13. One commenter noted the challenges of having malamutes, writing that having them is a “Trade off: more money for food, lower hearing bill. Just cuddle.” We couldn’t agree more!



27. Onward!

Good luck trying to control these humongous dogs, buddy. It looks like they’re the ones who are trying to take him for a walk! With Giant Alaskan Malamutes like these, a simple afternoon walk requires amassing serious upper body strength first.

The dogs are raring to get walking and the poor owner is summoning all his strength to keep these giant fur babies in line. It might be hard work to take care of such huge dogs but they’re so cute, so it’s all worth it.



28. One Giant Pal

This Giant Alaskan Malamute is huge and it doesn’t seem that his human owner minds one bit. The pair look quite comfy on the couch, though it seems this dog has managed to outgrow what would otherwise be a spacious sofa.

This photo has even sparked its very own meme with the caption “I don’t know what type of dog this is, but I would definitely ride it into battle.” Yes, this looks like a dog you don’t want to mess with. Just cuddle!



29. All Paws

This next Giant Alaskan Malamute towers over his owners but still seems to think he’s still a tiny pup. In this video, the owners keep trying to teach him the “paw” command but he still has a bit of learning to do.

On each attempt, this giant fluffer ends up collapsing into a snuggle and cuddle puddle after giving one paw. We can forgive him while he learns because it’s all so adorable! There are still more majestic dogs on this list so keep reading!



30. The Real-Life Teddy Bear

Remember those giant teddy bears you used to win as a prize at carnivals? Well, this Giant Alaskan Malamute is what those teddy bears would look like if they came to life! This giant pooch is just as fluffy as he is tall!

This dog must wow everyone it meets because its practically as big as its owner (maybe even bigger, to be honest). The owner doesn’t seem to mind though, because together they are all smiles, having the times of their lives.



31. Evo And His Baby Buddy

Who is this super cute duo who know how to play ever so gently? It’s none other than Evo and Adam! Evo the Alaskan Malamute just adores his new baby buddy, Adam, who was only four months old when this precious photo was taken.

Alaskan Malamutes are known for being incredibly active but it seems that Evo has learned to calm down a bit when around his dear human companion. According to one article about them, Evo likes to show his affection for Adam by licking his socks. Aww!



32. Giddyup!

Giddyup, doggy! These baby’s face says it all. Maybe it was the baby’s first time meeting an Alaskan Malamute? Maybe the baby had simply never seen such a big creature in his life? Getting to understand that fabulous mass of fur definitely comes with a shock.

Hopefully, this pair grew up to be the best of friends just like Evo and Adam and will continue to have many play dates in the years to come — even if that baby gets way too big to ride even that kind of beast! These kind of dogs are true forever friends.



33. All Hugs

There’s nothing like the bond between a boy and his dog. As babies grow into kids, the love for their furry companions only keeps growing and the dogs themselves feel it right back. That’s certainly the case with this gorgeous pair.

This Giant Alaskan Malamute is certainly feeling the love right back, lucky enough to be embraced in a big bear hug of his own. The adorable little boy seems so calm despite the fact that his dog is practically twice his size.



34. Alaskan Malamute Utopia

British TV host Anna Svenska had the extra-fun work assignment of visiting and interviewing someone who’s quite likely the world’s biggest Giant Alaskan Malamute fan. She’s a woman named Lorna Bartlett who runs a small kennel called Arctic Rainbow Malamutes in Essex, England.

The 12 dogs who live with the Bartletts were practically as big Anna herself, as this photo easily demonstrates, and at the end of the day, she even got to ride a sort of dogsled with wheels! Definitely an experience to remember!



35. Danny Direwolf

Meet Danny, a 12 year old Giant Alaskan Malamute who has become a social media star along with his awesome owner, known only by her username Danny Direwolf. The giant fluff of a dog has actually had a long journey because he was rescued from Singapore.

The duo now live in Canada, where they go on adventures and take adorable photos together. Danny’s owner also shares plenty of tips for taking care of Alaskan Malamutes and shares it through regular YouTube vidoes. Time to get an education, folks!



36. Husky Star

Kelly Lund from Denver, Colorado came from a super passionate dog-loving family, so when he was ready to look for his own furry companion he felt like he was up for anything. He thought a husky mixed with malamute would do the trick.

Their journey started on a snowy day in 2012 when Lund brought Loki home. He knew it wouldn’t be easy seeing that both huskies and malamutes are extremely intelligent, mischievous, dominant, and highly energetic pets. Loki even had a bit of arctic wolf in him, so Lund knew he was in for one real challenge.



37. Snapping Away

From the moment Lund took Loki home he started taking pictures of his new companion and posting them on his Instagram. Most people take pictures of their dogs, but Lund couldn’t help taking photograph after beautiful photograph of his pal Loki, non-stop!

After all these dog pictures quickly began to swamp Lund’s account, he decided to make Loki his own Instagram profile called Loki the Wolfdog. In that way, his own profile wouldn’t look like it was hijacked by a pack of wolves, literally!



38. An Instagram Star

The Instagram page was an instant hit! Loki became a star overnight. Lund started the profile in 2013, and within a year the husky and malamute mix had a following of 50,000 fans. Local dog food companies even offered to give Loki food in exchange for some pictures and posts.

Lund didn’t start the page to make Loki famous. He didn’t even use hashtags and certainly didn’t pay any advertisers for followers. But things weren’t slowing down for Loki. By the end of 2015, he had nearly 1 million Instagram followers.



39. A Special Connection

Lund believes that all the success lies in the connection he and Loki share. “Loki’s an animal that can tell what you’re thinking and knows how you’re feeling,” he told Outside magazine. Lund had no formal photography training, but the shots he took were breathtaking.

His natural flair for photography coupled with Loki’s good looks and athleticism spelt success for the pair. Eventually Lund chose to leave his day job and manage Loki’s social media account full time because of deals and projects with the likes of Mercedes, GoPro, and Google.



40. A Full Time Pet Daddy

By 2017, Loki’s Instagram had 1.7 million followers and Lund still enjoys spending all his time with his best friend, honing in on his photography skills and running all kinds of business ventures. He also set up an online shop to sell prints of his wolf dog, as well as calendars, mugs, t-shirts, and other paraphernalia.

When asked about his success, Lund had this to say: “A while back, I saw a dog meme that said, ‘Do what you love and success will follow.’ The punch line was, ‘So I sat on my couch, ate pizza, and took selfies with my dog…I’m still waiting for the money to roll in.’ Turned out that actually worked for me.”

Thieves can pickup the frequency and get into your car. ,https://www.iflscience.com/technology/heres-why-you-should-probably-wrap-your-car-keys-in-tin-foil/,"As technology evolves, so does thievery. And while that wireless key fob might make getting into your car pretty easy, it turns out it's quite easy to hack.

With an unprotected fob, thieves can intercept the signal from the fob to a car with a special receiver, known as a “relay attack”. They can then use this to enter the car and even turn on the ignition. But there's a simple solution, as it appears just wrapping your fob in foil prevents the signals from being transmitted.

“Although it's not ideal, it is the most inexpensive way,” Holly Hubert, a cybersecurity expert, told the Detroit Free Press. “The cyber threat is so dynamic and ever changing, it’s hard for consumers to keep up.”

According to Wired, the attack tricks the car and your key into thinking they're in close proximity of each other. “One hacker holds a device a few feet from the victim's key, while a thief holds the other near the target car,” they said. “The device near the car spoofs a signal from the key.”

While it appears that ordinary foil will do the trick, Hubert suggests purchasing a Faraday bag, a small bag lined with metallic material to prevent signals from going in or out. You can use them for other devices too, like phones or tablets.

A relay attack can remotely access your car. Brocreative/Shutterstock

Speaking to ABC News, the National Insurance Crime Bureau said there had been no confirmed cases of a relay attack in the US. However, it does appear to be a known risk that car companies are trying to tackle, and there have been unverified reports of such attacks.

In the UK, Bristol resident Kieran Bingham claimed someone had broken into his car with a fake wireless fob. He said that when he went in the car, he found the glove box had been opened and items had been scattered, reports the Bristol Post.

“My thinking is someone is going round hacking wireless keys,” Bingham said. “That’s why I’ve wrapped it in foil, to stop the device finding your keys.”

It’s not just foil that can stop thieves though. A fridge or freezer, microwave oven, or even a metal biscuit tin can also apparently stop the signal from being intercepted. Just don’t get your fob all biscuity, or accidentally turn the microwave on with it inside.",Here's Why You Should Probably Wrap Your Car Keys In Tin Foil
No. ,"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drinking-baking-soda-for-weight-loss#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20scientific%20evidence%20that%20baking%20soda%20is%20effective,a%20healthcare%20provider%20recommends%20it.","Baking soda is a common household item that people may use in baking and for treating indigestion. Some people try to use baking soda for weight loss. People considering using baking soda for this purpose should bear in mind the serious health risks. Below, we explore whether baking soda actually works for weight loss, as well as the safety concerns and potential side effects of using it. We also explain how to lose weight in a healthful way.

The theory Share on Pinterest Image credit: Michelle Arnold / EyeEm / Getty Images. Some people consume baking soda as a way to lose weight. They may drink it with water or another liquid. However, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that baking soda helps a person lose weight.

Does it work? Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is slightly alkaline. Some people believe that ingesting alkaline substances promotes weight loss. However, scientific research has not found evidence to support this theory. The body naturally regulates its pH levels to ensure that it is not too acidic or alkaline. What a person eats has very little effect on this process. Therefore, consuming baking soda to make the body more alkaline and promote weight loss is very unlikely to work. Drinking baking soda with water is one method that people may use to try to lose weight. In some cases, this may help a person lose weight, but probably not because of the baking soda. Research suggests that consuming more water can help a person lose weight. Therefore, any weight loss that a person experiences from drinking baking soda with water may be due to the water rather than the baking soda. By drinking more water, people may not feel the need to eat as much. In addition, having higher amounts of water in the body may promote the breakdown of fats.

Safety concerns Consuming baking soda can cause a variety of side effects. If people ingest baking soda, they will need to urinate more , which doctors call bicarbonate diuresis. By urinating more than usual, the body loses chloride, sodium, potassium, and water, all of which are necessary for normal bodily functions. Too much baking soda can impair the way the kidneys work, potentially preventing the kidneys from filtering out the baking soda properly. In extreme cases, dehydration from needing to urinate and being unable to replenish the water in the body may cause serious complications. In one case study , an individual experienced hemorrhagic encephalopathy, which involves bleeding and inflammation in the brain, after ingesting a large amount of baking soda. The authors suggested that this may have happened because consuming large amounts of baking soda can cause higher-than-normal levels of sodium in the blood, known as hypernatremia. In severe cases, hypernatremia may cause the neurons and cells in the brain to shrink. This shrinkage may cause brain hemorrhages because it increases the tension on veins in the cranium, which eventually ruptures the blood vessels. People often experience vomiting and diarrhea after ingesting too much baking soda. The reason for this is that the high amount of sodium pulls water into the digestive tract to help absorb it. After the body absorbs this sodium, it can cause seizures, dehydration, and kidney failure. People may also find it difficult to breathe after ingesting too much baking soda. If the body becomes too alkaline, it works to restore its acidity by keeping carbon dioxide inside the lungs rather than breathing it out. Another very serious potential side effect of ingesting too much baking soda is stomach rupture, which can happen due to the rapid formation of gas in the stomach. People are more likely to experience a stomach rupture after drinking alcohol or eating a large meal, as these activities increase the amount of gas already in the stomach.

Recommendation Poison Control recommend that people do not ingest baking soda by itself for any reason unless a healthcare provider directs them to do so. In that case, they should only take baking soda as their healthcare provider recommends. Certain people are more at risk of side effects than others. People who should avoid using baking soda include older adults and those who have alcohol use disorder, a lower volume of blood in the body, or kidney or lung disease. People should always contact their healthcare provider if they are using baking soda for anything other than baking or cooking. The potential side effects of consuming baking soda in large amounts on its own or with water are potentially very serious. A person who has done so may need emergency medical attention.

Healthful weight loss People are more likely to reach and maintain their goal weight by losing weight gradually and steadily. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that people lose no more than 2 pounds (lb) , or 0.9 kilograms, per week. Physical activity An important step for weight loss is setting realistic goals. These goals should be a mix of long- and short-term, each with a reward at the end. For example, if a person wants to lose 10 lb, that could be a long-term goal. A short-term goal could be the number of steps a person aims to take each day to lose that weight. Other short-term goals could be walking to and from work or going for a 20-minute bicycle ride over the weekend. Short-term goals should be specific and realistic. For one reason or another, such as a longer day at work or family commitments, people may not reach their short-term goals. This is completely normal , and people should just try to set new, achievable goals as soon as they can. Healthful eating Healthful eating habits are vital for losing weight in a sustainable way. Most people form their eating habits during childhood, and it can be difficult, but not impossible, to change them. It is important not to make sudden, drastic changes to the diet, such as only eating a salad at every meal. Although this approach may lead to short-term weight loss, it is very difficult to stick to and may not give people all of the nutrients that they need. Instead, the CDC suggest a three-step approach for developing more healthful eating habits: Reflect on eating habits, both good and bad, and identify any triggers for those that are unhealthful. Replace less healthful eating habits with more healthful ones. Reinforce the new eating habits. For example, if a person realizes that they eat too quickly, they can consciously focus on eating more slowly. They can do this by purposely putting down their eating utensils between bites, among other tactics. Another strategy is to make a healthful meal plan, then meal prep for the following week. A person can make all of their meals for the week during the weekend. Doing this can help reduce the temptation of buying takeout or fast food. As with physical activity goals, it is important that people do not think that 1 day of eating with their old habits means that all of their efforts are pointless. Setbacks do happen, but it is important that people start afresh the next day and continue reinforcing their new, healthful habits.",Drinking baking soda for weight loss: Does it work?

The world was shocked when Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow named their daughter Apple in 2004.

But since then food-related baby names have become big news.

A recent BabyCentre post revealed baby names such as Saffron, Honey, Kale, Coco and Apricot are becoming more popular in 2018.

However one couple, who took it too far, had their baby name banned by a French judge.

The parents wanted to call their newborn daughter Nutella – because they hoped she could emulate the sweetness and popularity of the chocolate spread.

However, a judge ruled the name could only lead to “mockery and disobliging remarks.”

It was ruled that the child’s name be shortened to the more conventional “Ella.”

Another couple from New Zealand made up a very inappropriate name for their baby.

"Dishwashers are faster, more hygienic, and better for the environment. ",https://www.sciencealert.com/is-it-better-to-wash-dishes-by-hand-or-dishwasher-environment-science,"It's a very human trait to assume that, no matter how far we advance technology, machines will never be able to replace our skills.

Take doing the dishes for example: the first dishwasher was built back in 1850, but more than 150 years later, and many of us still do our dishes ourselves, or at least take the time to pre-wash them before loading them into a dishwasher.

But according to the stats, modern dishwashers are now officially faster, more hygienic and way better for the environment that we'll ever be. So maybe it's finally time to give in and let the machines take over.

Or as Consumer Reports puts it, it's time to just ""let the dishwasher do its job"".

There's still the prevailing myth that washing by hand is cleaner and better for the environment - particularly if you manage to use just one sink-full of water for a whole family's worth of dishes.

But research shows that this isn't the case anymore, with dishwashers becoming not only far cheaper to run, but also much more water- and energy-efficient.

""While it may be possible to use less water/energy by washing dishes by hand, it is extremely unlikely,"" Jonah Schein, the technical coordinator for homes and buildings from the Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense program, referring to Energy Star-certified dishwashers, said in a statement.

""In order to wash the same amount of dishes that can fit in a single load of a full size dishwasher and use less water, you would need to be able to wash eight full place settings and still limit the total amount of time that the faucet was running to less than two minutes,"" he adds.

OK we get it - it's hard to use less water than a machine. But surely we still need to give dishwashers a helping hand by giving dishes a quick rinse before loading them in?

Unfortunately not, according to Steven Nadel, the executive director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. In fact, if you've got a modern dishwasher, it's totally unnecessary to do anything but scrape the food scraps off plates.

""Old dishwashers, to generalise, didn't get dishes very clean unless you pre-washed,"" Nadel told Chris Mooney over at The Washington Post back in 2015.

""The new dishwashers, that is not an issue. Almost all of them have what's called soil sensors. Depending on how dirty the dishes are, they will wash more or less. They will get the dishes clean.""

Dishwashers can also spray highly controlled jets of water upwards of 60 degrees Celsius (140 Fahrenheit) at the dishes, something our human hands can't handle - although experts recommend you only need to set it as high as around 48 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit).

""The worst approach for the environment - and energy and water bills - is pre-washing dishes in constantly running hot water and then running them in an ancient dishwasher that was not built to modern standards,"" wrote Mooney.

In fact, by pre-washing our dishes, Consumer Reports suggests that households could be wasting more than 22,000 litres (6,000 gallons) of water per year.

Still not convinced that a machine can do household chores better than you? Well, we hate to tell you this, but you're literally wasting your life.

The Energy Star program has worked out that handing over all dishwashing responsibilities to a machine saves you 230 hours, or nearly 10 days, each year. Which makes for a pretty compelling argument.

So what are you going to do with all your newly found spare time? Why not make yourself useful and work on some environment-helping citizen science projects, or help edit some of the breathtaking raw footage of Jupiter taken by NASA's Juno probe. Who said technology didn't need us?

Dental brace wire. ,https://www.shared.com/she-swallowed-a-piece-of-metal-decades-ago-but-doctors-were-dumbfounded-when-they-pulled-it-out/,"When a 30-year-old woman walked into a hospital complaining of stomach pains, doctors examined her for all of the typical causes one might expect: ulcer, irritable bowl syndrome, hernia, or gallstones.

But their tests found none of the normal causes.

One of her doctors reported that her heart rate was faster than normal and the lining of her abdominal wall was inflamed.

But after further investigation, her vital signs, laboratory tests, ultrasound and the scans of her liver, gallbladder and bile ducts were all normal

When they asked her if she had recently undergone a surgery, the unnamed woman replied ""no."" This eliminated the possibility that a surgeon accidentally left behind a foreign object, but, after looking at a CT scan, doctors realized that something metallic was definitely in there.

When they removed the object, they couldn't believe what it was. Find out for yourself on the next page!

Even though she had not had surgery and doesn't recall swallowing a piece of metal, doctors confirmed that their patient definitely had a foreign object lodged in her intestines - but what could it be?

The 2 1/2 inch-long piece of metal was a piece of dental brace wire that she had accidentally swallowed at least a decade ago!

Doctors were baffled by how she had managed to swallow it without noticing.

""The case is so unique is because normally if you swallow something like that, it presents earlier,"" doctor Talia Shepherd told Popular Science.

Apparently the woman had worn braces 10 years earlier, and has since had them removed. The piece she swallowed didn't cause her any pain until recently, when it caused her intestine to twist around on itself.

""We were all a bit dumbfounded,"" Shepherd told the magazine. ""It wasn't what I was expecting to find at all.""

Thankfully, surgeons were able to repair remove the object and repair the damage. Good thing they caught it in time!

She doesn't care. ,https://popcrush.com/selena-gomez-responds-to-justin-biebers-engagement/,"When it comes to Justin Bieber's new engagement to Hailey Baldwin, Bieber's ex Selena Gomez seems to have this to say:

TMZ broke the flash engagement news Sunday morning (July 8), and noted that Bieber proposed to his model girlfriend during the couple's recent getaway to the Bahamas. And while fans have been excited by the prospect of the marriage-to-be, Us Weekly reports that Gomez couldn't be more unmoved by the news.

“Selena doesn’t care. She’s over Justin and the last time they broke up allowed her to get over him fully,” a source told the site.

The source also noted that Bieber may have made the proposal so public to get a rise out of Gomez.

“Anytime he has done this in the past, Selena doesn’t even see stories about him in the media,” the source added. “Her team makes sure she is protected from it, so it’s a waste of time on Justin’s end if that’s his goal. No one in her circle speaks about him when they are on the outs and she keeps her circle and team very small.”

Bieber and Baldwin, who dated from 2015 to 2016, only reconciled a month ago. Bieber and Gomez rekindled their romance in late 2017, five years after a very public breakup. They split again months later, though, mostly due to pressure from Gomez's mother, who had misgivings about the relationship.",Selena Gomez Has Something to Say About Justin Bieber’s Engagement

On the way home from work you have every intention of greeting your partner with a friendly ""Hi, how are you? How was your day?"" and listening attentively while he or she tells you all about it.

But the minute you open the door and drop your keys on the counter, you find yourself knee-deep in an argument about how he or she bought the wrong type of pepper.

Don't worry: It's perfectly normal to get into arguments like these with your significant other every once in a while, says John Gottman, a psychologist at the University of Washington and founder of the Gottman Institute.

It's what happens next that you need to watch out for, he says.

When you express your frustration over the pepper mix-up, do you listen while he explains that perhaps you didn't ever tell him what type of pepper you wanted? Do you think this over, and, when you realize that maybe he's right, do you apologize? Or do you adopt an attitude and think to yourself, What kind of an idiot doesn't know that bell peppers are for stir-fry and habaneros are for salsa?

If you find yourself in the second situation, you're likely displaying contempt for your partner, and it could be putting your relationship in jeopardy.

Contempt, a virulent mix of anger and disgust, is far more toxic than simple frustration or negativity. It involves seeing your partner as beneath you, rather than as an equal.

Gottman and University of California-Berkeley psychologist Robert Levenson found this single behavior is so powerful that they can use it — along with the negative behaviors of criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling — to predict divorce with 93% accuracy

""Contempt,"" says Gottman, ""is the kiss of death.""

The striking 93% figure comes from a 14-year study of 79 couples living across the US Midwest (21 of whom divorced during the study period) published in 2002. Since then, decades of research into marriage and divorce have lent further support to the idea linking divorce with specific negative behaviors.

One recent study of 373 newlywed couples, for example, found that couples who yelled at each other, showed contempt for each other, or simply began to disengage from conflict within the first year of marriage were more likely to divorce, even as far as 16 years down the road.

So why are couples who exhibit this one behavior more likely to split up?

It comes down to a superiority complex.

Feeling smarter than, better than, or more sensitive than your significant other means you're not only less likely see his or her opinions as valid, but, more important, you're far less willing to try to put yourself in his or her shoes to try to see a situation from his or her perspective.

Picture a resonance chamber, suggests Gottman, with each person in the relationship a source of his or her own musical (or emotional) vibrations. If each partner is closed off to the other person's vibes (or emotions) and more interested in unleashing their own feelings of disgust and superiority, these negative vibrations will resound against one another, escalating a bad situation ""until something breaks,"" Gottman says.

If you've noticed yourself or your partner exhibiting this type of behavior, don't despair — it doesn't mean your relationship is doomed.

Being aware that you're doing something that could negatively affect your partner is the first step to actively combating it. If you can figure out how to avoid the behavior or replace it with a more positive one, you'll likely greatly improve the relationship — and increase your chances of staying together for longer.",Scientists say one behavior is the 'kiss of death' for a relationship

This generation, unlike the ones that came before it, is as likely as not to earn less than their parents. Among people who did not plan to have children, 23 percent said it was because they were worried about the economy. A third said they couldn’t afford child care, 24 percent said they couldn’t afford a house and 13 percent cited student debt.

Financial concerns also led people to have fewer children than what they considered to be ideal: 64 percent said it was because child care was too expensive, 43 percent said they waited too long because of financial instability and about 40 percent said it was because of a lack of paid family leave.

Women face another economic obstacle: Their careers can stall when they become mothers.

This spring, Brittany Butler, 22, became the first person in her family to graduate from college, and she will start graduate school in social work in the fall. She said it would probably be at least 10 years before she considered having children, until she could raise them in very different circumstances than in her poor hometown neighborhood in Baton Rouge, La.

She admits being “a little nervous” that it may become harder to get pregnant, but she wants to pay off her student loans and, most of all, be able to live in a safe neighborhood.

“A lot of people, especially communities of color, can’t really afford that now,” she said. “I’m just apprehensive about going back to poverty. I know how it goes, I know the effects of it, and I’m thinking, ‘Can I ever break this curse?’ I would just like to change the narrative around.”

Starting a family used to be what people did to embark on adulthood; now many say they want to wait. Last year, the only age group in which the fertility rate increased was women ages 40 to 44. Delaying marriage and birth is a big reason people say they had fewer children than their ideal number: Female fertility begins significantly decreasing at age 32.",Americans Are Having Fewer Babies.

Puerto Rico. ,https://time.com/5331664/hurricane-beryl-path-track/,"Hurricane Beryl was downgraded to a tropical storm Saturday morning, after being named the first hurricane of this year’s Atlantic hurricane season on Friday.

The path of the relatively tiny Tropical Storm Beryl is currently tracking westwards through the Atlantic in the general direction of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is expected to reach the Lesser Antilles by Sunday night or Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHS).

Tropical storms are less severe than hurricanes, with wind gusts between 39 and 73 miles per hour; a hurricane, by contrast, includes maximum sustained wind gusts between 74 and 95 miles per hour, according to AccuWeather. Though Beryl is not forecast to be at hurricane strength when it reaches the Lesser Antilles, the NHS said some islands can expect “direct impacts from wind and rainfall.”

The NHC is also warning that changes to Beryl’s intensity will be “difficult to predict” due to its very small size.

“Confidence in the official intensity forecast is also lower than normal,” the Center warned. “Rapid changes in intensity, both up and down, that are difficult to predict are possible during the next couple days.”

The first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, subtropical storm Alberto, failed to reach hurricane status. But it still led to several fatalities and approximately $50 million in damage.

Many Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico, were devastated by intense storms during last year’s hurricane season, which officially lasts from June 1 until November 30.

Some experts have raised concerns that climate change might be generating stronger hurricanes, while climate scientists have warned the 2018 hurricane season could be worse than usual.

Men who worked long hours did not see a similar risk

(CNN) Here's a good reason for women to work less, ask for a raise or get their partners to pick up around the house more: If women work fewer hours, it'll lower their risk of diabetes, according to a study published Monday in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care.

Researchers looked at data from 7,065 Canadians who were tracked over 12 years. What they found was that women who consistently worked 45 hours or more a week had a 63% greater risk of diabetes compared with those who worked between 35 and 40 hours a week.

The effect was only slightly reduced when smoking, exercise, alcohol intake and body-mass index were taken into account.

Men who worked longer hours, on the other hand, did not face an increased risk of diabetes.

It's unclear why there is a gender difference in this risk, but it may involve what women do with their time off.","Hard-working women, go home earlier to avoid this disease"
Nothing. ,https://www.popsugar.com/family/I-Let-My-Baby-Cry-41812513,"Three months into this parenting gig, I'd had enough. Our bedtime routine with our infant son had turned into a two-hour affair that left me and my husband eating dinner at 10 p.m., me up with indigestion for another few hours, and only a few hours of shut-eye before I had to wake up for the day. I was preparing to go back to work, and no amount of concealer, corrector, or eye masks could hide the dark purple circles that had become permanent fixtures under my eyes, never mind function like a thinking adult in an office job.

I needed a solution, and I needed one quick. My own parents swore by ""Ferberizing"" me, and I was willing to give it a try. Ferberizing, or ""crying it out,"" is a sleep training method popularized by Dr. Richard Ferber to teach a baby to soothe him or herself to sleep. The practice involves putting your baby to bed while still awake and leaving her there even if she cries. After a predetermined amount of time, parents can go in and soothe their child (patting her back, talking to her, etc.), without picking her up. Dr. Ferber says that after a few days, the baby learns to soothe herself and fall asleep on her own.

But when I asked for some tips and tricks from the moms in my moms group at the local park, I was greeted with blank stares and astonishment. One suggested it was a form of torture and that my baby would never trust me again. Another clenched her chest, saying she ""could never!"" And the one sitting next to me pointedly scooted a few inches away from me.

After that reaction, could I really do it? You don't get much closer than me and my parents, so it doesn't seem to have affected our relationship. And I really needed to get into a routine before returning to work.

So on a Wednesday night when my son was 3 months old, I bathed him, lotioned him up, fed him, read him three books, and put him in his crib in a dreamy but still technically awake state. As soon as I closed his door, he was crying. My husband said we should wait another day and try it tomorrow, but I knew that if we put it off today, we'd put it off tomorrow, and we couldn't just do this the night before I went back to work.

The first stretch of crying was painful. I couldn't believe I was letting my baby cry so much. Five minutes later, after soothing him, it appeared that all was well, until two minutes after closing his door, the same thing happened. The next stretch was 10 minutes, and we barely made it through before the timer went off and I raced into his room to begin the routine again. I didn't think we'd make it through the next stretch (15 minutes), until my phone rang. My husband's cousin was calling to check on me and see how I was doing in general. I told her we were Ferberizing and just starting our 15-minute stretch. Before I knew it, my alarm rang that it was 15 minutes. She had talked my ear off for the entire time — mindless things that she probably didn't even care about but was throwing my way to keep me occupied. And I looked at our baby monitor, he was asleep — with a big smile on his face.

I'd never say that it was easy and that we never turned back — no one told me about the torture that is sleep regression or how cutting a tooth can mess up everything! — but we certainly crossed a hurdle that day. And our sleep routine became bearable.

Ten years later, I can tell you that my son has shown no adverse affects from his Ferberization. He still likes me to sit with him when he goes to sleep but can easily do so without me. He still hugs me and treats me as his confidante, but he is also independent and strong-willed. Like recent studies show, the Ferber method is safe, when done correctly.

When Spotify came along even the biggest optimists connected to the platform could not have anticipated the monumental success it would become.

Another Reddit user pointed out that it may not have been a mistake after all:

Reptiles. ,https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/why-you-should-never-put-goldfish-park-pond-or-down-toilet/,"Goldfish might look nice, but they can also spread a variety of decidedly not-nice viruses. kaori/pixabay.com

Have you ever walked past a fountain in the park and seen beautifully coloured fish swimming about, and wondered how they got there? Often with the best of intentions, people leave unwanted pet fish in public fountains, ponds and natural waterways for a variety of reasons, including boredom with their pet, moving house, or frequent illness in their fish.

But these places are not a natural home for ornamental fish, and they can harm Australia’s unique ecosystems.

Fish are very popular pets, for good reason. They take up very little space or time and can add a calming presence to any living room. But fish come with the same responsibilities as any other pet. Much as (I hope) you wouldn’t turn a dog or cat loose to fend for itself in the local area, there is no place for pet fish in our waterways.

Alien Fish Species Harm Our Ecosystems

Rehoming pet fish in natural waterways causes two big issues. The first is that most fish kept as pets are not naturally found in Australia, so releasing them means introducing an alien species into the wild.

These alien fish are pests and can outcompete native fish for shelter, food and other resources. Australia has 34 alien freshwater fish species living in the wild, two-thirds of which are ornamental fish such as goldfish, cichlids, guppies and gourami. Once an alien fish species becomes established, it is impossible to get rid of it.

The second problem is the inadvertent release of exotic diseases. Australia imports 19 million ornamental fish every year – almost one per person! Your pet might appear healthy, but it can carry exotic bacteria and viruses.

When introduced to a new waterway, these pathogens can potentially wipe out entire populations of native fish. What’s more, many unique Australian fish such as Murray cod and Macquarie perch are particularly sensitive to exotic pathogens.

Unsurprisingly, Australia has strict import conditions for ornamental fish (and other pets too). However, there have been two key cases of exotic viruses hitchhiking with imported pet fish.

Goldfish Get Herpes Too!

The first involves a disease called herpesviral haematopoietic necrosis, which affects only goldfish. It is caused by the virus Cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV2), first isolated in 1992 in Japan after a spate of goldfish deaths. Since then, CyHV2 has caused large goldfish kills in Taiwan, the United States and Britain, and it is now present in Australia. It is not known how long a goldfish can spread the virus once it becomes infected.

You never know what’s under the surface. aussiegall/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY

Before 2010, CyHV2 was considered exotic to Australia and all imported goldfish were required to be certified as free of the virus. Despite this, in 2008 sick goldfish from several pet shops in Sydney tested positive for it. Pet shops stock a mix of imported and domestic fish, so the source of infection was unknown.

To try to trace the source of the virus, my colleagues and I have tested goldfish from farms across Australia and in wild populations. We found CyHV2 at two farms, one in Victoria and one in New South Wales. More importantly, the virus was found in wild goldfish collected from Cotter Reservoir, ACT, and the Ovens and Murray River in Victoria.

Our results confirmed that CyHV2 was present in both domestically farmed and wild goldfish populations. The virus is now considered an established pathogen in Australia, and in 2011 the Department of Agriculture dropped the requirement for goldfish to be certified free of CyHV2 before entering the country.

Goldfish were first introduced to Australia in 1876 and have long been established in all states except the Northern Territory. Although we can’t be sure when the introduction of CyHV2 occurred, it is assumed to have been within the past two decades.

Once established, pathogens like this are almost impossible to eradicate. The good news is that CyHV2 infects only goldfish, which is an alien species and is not vital to our ecosystems.

Lessons Learned

The second case involves a pathogen called infectious spleen and necrosis virus (ISKNV). This belongs to a group of viruses called the megalocytiviruses, notorious for killing large numbers of fish farmed for human consumption as well as ornamental fish. ISKNV kills Murray cod, and our soon-to-be-published research suggests it can also cause disease in Macquarie perch and Golden perch.

Research has identified imported ornamental fish infected with ISKNV both before and after quarantine. Infected fish have also been found at pet shops and at a fish farm in Queensland. However, all the ornamental fish collected from the wild tested negative for the virus. From March 2016 onwards, regulations for imported fish have been tightened to clamp down on this virus.

ISKNV is still considered exotic to Australia. To protect Australia’s biodiversity and aquaculture industries, changes to importing ornamental fish were introduced from March 2016. This shows how, with the right monitoring, exotic pathogens can be spotted and dealt with before they become established in the wild.

Caring For Your Fish – And The Environment

Like any pet, the decision to bring a pet fish home should be made with the care and thoughtful consideration that is owed to these beautiful creatures. If you can no longer care for your pet fish, the best choice is to find another living room for it to enjoy. Alternatively, you can take it to your veterinarian who can kill it humanely. If your fish has died, throw it in the rubbish bin, not down the toilet!

Ornamental fish are devastating to our natural waterways. Greater awareness of responsible pet fish ownership could have avoided alien species establishing themselves in the wild and prevented death and disease among Australia’s native fish.

Once a week to maximize happiness. ,https://time.com/4692326/how-much-sex-is-healthy-in-a-relationship/,"Sex and health go hand in hand. Research has linked it to a slimmer waistline, a stronger heart and a lower risk for prostate and breast cancers. It’s also a boon for mental health, since sex is associated with lower rates of depression and better mood.

But Americans today are having less of it than Americans a decade ago, according to a just-released study appearing in Archives of Sexual Behavior.

From 2010 to 2014, the average American adult had sex nine fewer times per year than Americans did from 2000 to 2004, the researchers found. That drop in frequency was even steeper for married couples who live together; they had sex 16 fewer times a year.

What’s going on? “We can only speculate,” says the study’s first author, Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University and author of Generation Me. But the increase in time spent working and parenting may be possible explanations for the drop in sex among married people. she says. Plus, with the rise in quality and accessibility of streaming entertainment, competition for free time is stiffer. “There are now so many other ways to spend leisure time at home,” she says. The allure of Netflix and other device-based diversions may be elbowing sex aside.

But despite these declines in hanky panky, our lives are far from sexless. The average adult enjoys sex 54 times a year, or a little more than once a week, Twenge’s data show. While married couples under the same roof don’t fool around quite as much, they still have sex about 51 times each year.

That’s a good thing, because having sex once a week may be “optimal” if you’re hoping to maximize happiness, according to research from Amy Muise, an assistant professor of psychology at York University in Canada.

Muise and her study team found that couples who have a lot of sex tend to experience better wellbeing. “Sex is associated with feeling more satisfied in a relationship,” Muise says. But beyond once a week, the wellbeing benefits of sex seem to level off. That’s not to say that having sex a few times a week (or more) is a bad thing. It just doesn’t seem to make couples any happier, she says.

Of course, it’s hard to show cause and effect when it comes to sex and your health. Leading a happy, healthy lifestyle likely leads to more sex; the act itself doesn’t necessarily improve your physical and mental wellness. Still, whether sex is a symptom or a cause of wellbeing, a healthy sex life is worth the work.

If you’re falling short of that once-a-week quota, making an effort to have more sex could be a good idea, as long as it doesn’t feel too forced. A 2015 study from Carnegie Mellon University concluded that couples who tried to have more sex did not feel happier—but that study’s author, economics and psychology professor George Loewenstein, takes his own findings with a grain of salt. “In retrospect, I believe that this study was misguided,” he says. “Instructing couples to double their frequency might have turned sex into a chore for them.” Muise also points out that the couples in Loewenstein’s study were already having sex once a week. “It’s possible that they were already maximizing the association [between sex and] wellbeing,” she says.

“I still think that couples could benefit from a bit of outside encouragement to have more sex,” Loewenstein says. That’s especially true if you and your significant other have been together for a long time. “When a couple has been together for some time, the mere presence of the other person, even unclothed, ceases to be exciting or arousing.” But that doesn’t mean doing it won’t be just as fun and invigorating as it used to be, he says. It may just take a little more work to get your fires started.

But this study from Japan has a stunning solution for curbing suicide attempts: blue-colored lights.

According to CityLab, Japanese railways have been attempting to stop train station suicides throughout their metropolitan areas for some years now, but the implementation is tricky. Tokyo is currently working towards their goal of installing preventative barricades in all 243 of their stations by 2023 – but the barriers are expensive to construct, and many train stations lack the infrastructure to support the barricades.

So until a more efficient solution is used, stations are relying on the calming effects of blue light as a means of dissuading potential suicide victims.

The research, which was published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, studied the effects of installing blue light-emitting-diode (LED) lamps on railway platforms and at railway crossings as a way of deterring suicides in 71 different stations.

Over the course of 10 years, the suicide rate at the stations plummeted by 84%.

“As blue lights are easier and less expensive to install than platform screen doors, they can be a cost-effective method for suicide prevention,” says the study’s authors.

Since the study was published, several UK train stations have implemented similar fixtures in their own facilities. In addition to suicide rates falling, the station works have also provided anecdotal evidence that there have been less incidents of vandalism and crime as well.

India. ,https://www.iflscience.com/environment/the-cheapest-way-to-a-zeroemission-world-needs-nuclear-power-claims-new-study/,"An analysis of the costs to reach net-zero in many countries sees nuclear fusion power as the cheapest option. Image Credit: TTstudio/Shutterstock.com

New generation nuclear power stations might be crucial to achieving the target of zero emissions by mid-century and staving off the worst of the climate crisis, a new study published in the journal Nature Energy suggests.

Solar power and wind are key to hitting this goal, but they might not be enough without major investments, or in places without much sun or wind.

To minimize the catastrophic consequences of global warming, humanity needs to keep the global mean temperature below the threshold of 1.5 C above the pre-industrial average. Crucial to achieving that is energy production reaching zero emissions globally by 2050. Previous studies have shown that by ramping up solar and wind power stations, our species can easily reduce emissions by 80 percent.

To achieve the goal of 100 percent reduction, there ought to be major expansions in energy storage capabilities and electricity transmission capabilities. This is because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine. If these expansions aren’t or cannot be implemented, there’s a need for more zero-carbon energy sources – and that’s where new designs of advanced nuclear power plants come in.

“Under strict greenhouse gas emission controls, reliable power generation provided by nuclear power has a lot of potential value in the electricity grid for most nations,” lead author Lei Duan of the Carnegie’s Department of Global Ecology said in a statement.

“Places with poor wind resources can benefit from nuclear earlier in the path to zero emissions, whereas places with very good wind resources would only need it to get rid of the last traces of carbon emissions.”

The model looked at 42 country-level regions and used current prices for technology to estimate the cheapest way to achieve zero emissions. The researchers found that nuclear power is the scenario that would cost less.

“Our analysis looked at the cheapest way to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions assuming today’s prices. We found that at today’s price, nuclear is the cheapest way to eliminate all electricity-system carbon emissions nearly everywhere. However, if energy storage technologies became very cheap, then wind and solar could potentially be the least-cost path to a zero-emission electricity system,” added Ken Caldeira, also of the Carnegie’s Department of Global Ecology.

There are many people that do not like nuclear power (we are talking fission here, rather than the still experimental fusion). One main issue is the disposal of waste in a safe manner, since many countries continue to lack the proper investment into this. Finland, for example, is burying it in a special facility where it will be sealed for the next 100,000 years (although it won’t be very dangerous in just a few hundred years).

Another risk often raised is the possibility of a nuclear accident – however, while it is a risk, it is important to put it in context. Air pollution, which coal and oil powerplants contribute to, is responsible for millions of deaths every year. The World Health Organization estimates that the Chernobyl disaster, the worst nuclear accident in history, led to the premature deaths of 4,000 people.

Nuclear power might not be needed if energy storage solutions can be found, but if they are not, we might not have many other options.","The Cheapest Way To A Zero-Emission World Needs Nuclear Power, Claims New Study"

Now of course, when getting married, most people try to stick to their vows to stay loyal to each other, but the 7-year itch can prove to be quite a difficult task to overcome for many people in serious commitments. A term used by psychologists, it suggests the notion that around the 7-year mark of marriage individuals become a little distant with each other as their happiness and satisfaction with the relationship begins to decline, and the urge to stray gets stronger.

A research team from Israel looked into reasons why people who have been tempted to cheat have managed to resist. What they discovered, published in The Journal of Sex Research, was they were able to identify the most likely time men and women are most at risk of cheating in a marriage.

Superdrug Online Doctor

The researchers asked 423 participants to answer a questionnaire rating the importance of 29 different reasons to avoid and resist cheating, as well as state the likelihood of them cheating if the opportunity presented itself.

The research saw that there were numerous reasons why those who took part in the questionnaire resisted being unfaithful, mostly to do with their moral compass and the fear of being single. Their findings also revealed that, for women, the window of time when they were more likely to cheat on their partners was between the 6-10 years mark.

However, the study also showed that when it came to men cheating in heterosexual marriages, they were most likely to cheat after 11 years, showing they're no angels either.

Earlier this year Superdrug's Online Doctor ran a survey of over 2,000 Americans and Europeans to work out why men and women cheated. Interestingly, the number one reason for both heterosexual men and women both sides of the Atlantic were the same. For both American and European women, the top reason was down to feeling like they weren’t being given enough attention from their partner. For American and European men, their top reason was that the other person was ""really hot"".","This Is When You're Most Likely To Be Cheated On, According To A New Study"
They don't sell frozen patties so they can't ship them across the country. ,https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/why-in-n-out-wont-open-on-the-east-coast/,"In-N-Out restaurants are exclusive to the West Coast–but they have just as many fans on the East Coast too. Here's the real reason why the chain won't be opening locations on the East Coast.

Ask any East Coast or West Coast burger-lover, and they will likely have an opinion on a timeless debate. Which burger is better—In-N-Out or Shake Shack? For In-N-Out lovers, the hope for some East Coast locations is strong. But there’s one main reason why the chain hasn’t expanded far from the Pacific—frozen patties.

The company refuses to sell frozen patties to ensure that customers are only eating the highest-quality meat, according to the official website. That’s why all In-N-Out restaurant locations are within 300 miles of In-N-Out’s patty-making facilities. These facility locations are only in California and Texas, hence the lack of any East Coast locations. This commitment to fresh food applies to other key ingredients, too—the fries are hand-cut, the lettuce is hand-leafed, and the buns are freshly baked. Not to mention, the chain locations don’t have any freezers or microwaves. Don’t have an In-N-Out nearby? Make our best copycat recipes (no frozen patties included!).

Other restaurant chains that also use unfrozen beef haven’t had a problem with creating more locations all over America (and the world) including Five Guys, Shake Shack, and Smashburger.

There are a few other reasons, however, as to why In-N-Out hasn’t expanded. Lynsi Snyder—the company president and only grandchild of the In-N-Out founders Harry and Esther Snyder—said that they would never franchise, Business Insider reports. Plus, limiting locations of the fast-food restaurant also minimizes competition while giving the chain an exclusive appeal.

He puts salt on it. ,https://nextshark.com/lil-baby-rapper-japan-eating-watermelon/,"An American rapper is making waves in Japan, not for his music, but for the “unusual” way he eats watermelon that he showed in a recent video.

Atlanta-based hip-hop artist Dominique Jones, aka “Lil Baby,” was shown sprinkling a can of salt on a pack of diced watermelon in a footage from Source Magazine’s documentary on his life.

The clip, shown in the video above along the 3:13 mark, became popular among Japanese netizens who found the practice quite relatable as putting salt on watermelon is also a common practice in Japan, according to SoraNews24.

Elsewhere, the idea of putting salt on a sweet fruit might sound absurd, and even unthinkable, as revealed in the reaction of Lil Baby’s crew when he started doing it.

“You’ve never seen that?” he asked the person holding the camera. “Probably some down south sh*t. Probably is….”

YouTube users were also split on the whole “salt on watermelon” idea:

“Real southern boy salt on the watermelon boi ya late on this,” one commenter wrote.

“Bru Mexicans stay puttin’ salt on fruit lol. I was puttin’ salt on oranges and watermelon in 3rd grade,” another chimed in.

“Y’all trippin’ if you don’t put salt on yo watermelon,” wrote another.

“Bro that salt on the watermelon had me confused AF. It’s cuz I’m from LA,” commented one user.

“Ain’t neva seen no salt on watermelon, thought it was sugar at first haha,” another said.

“I thought he poured salt on strawberries I was like wtf but when I seen it was watermelon I was like ok that’s normal,” added a surprised netizen.

As for Japanese netizens, however, they finally discovered that they weren’t the only ones doing it.

“I always thought salt on watermelon was only a Japanese thing?!” wrote a Japanese user.

“Salt is good, but putting lemon on watermelon is the real deal,” another suggested.

“When I was a kid I didn’t like the taste of watermelon, so I used a lot of salt to cover it up,” said one commenter.

“Salting the watermelon helps bring out the sweetness,” explained another.

It is worth noting that while many Japanese are familiar with putting salt on watermelon, not everyone is a fan of the curious eating style.

Because they're in love. ,https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a39283246/ariana-grande-pete-davidson-scooter-braun-doomed-romance/,"Insider's story on Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's manager Scooter Braun featured more than just insight into Braun's reported impact on Bieber and his ex Selena Gomez's past on-off romance. A source also detailed how management being deeply involved in Grande's relationship—and eventual called-off engagement—to Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson affected the trajectory of Davidson and Grande's whirlwind romance, which ended in October 2018.

Both Davidson and Grande have moved on now. Grande is married to Dalton Gomez, and Davidson is dating Kim Kardashian, much to the chagrin of Kardashian's ex (and Braun's former client) Kanye West.



Insider reported that Braun actually introduced Grande and Davidson. A month after their breakup, Grande released “Thank U, Next,” a massive commercial success for her with its record-breaking YouTube video. (It was the most watched music video debut in the platform's history.)

A person close to the situation told Insider that Davidson felt “blindsided” by the release. “I think their relationship didn't get a fair shake because management was so involved.”

Davidson admitted to be blindsided by the song coming out during a late December 2018 comedy show in Boston. A source told E! then that Davidson joked about it during the show, saying, “Here's the thing about the breakup song. Usually breakup songs you know who it's about but you don't really know. That G named all of us. Bam. She named all of us. And then, tells us, yeah, he has a big dick.”

Davidson, noting the video came out right before he had to go on SNL, said, “That shit came out before I had to put on a f*cking duck hat and be like, ‘derrrp here's the pizza!’ So all my friends were there. It was a sad day. We didn't know it was going to happen.”

Upon playing it, Davidson and his friends, “We're all like, ‘Ehhh… it's ok.’ We're like ‘Okay, it's not that bad for you.’” In the song, Grande sings of Davidson, “Even almost got married / And for Pete, I'm so thankful.”

Grande told Billboard in a story released weeks before Davidson's comedy show that she did send Davidson “Thank U, Next” before releasing it. “I wasn’t going to blindside anybody,” she said.

Grande later reflected on their romance to Vogue in her cover story published in July 2019. After her breakup with Mac Miller, “My friends were like, ‘Come [to New York City]! We’re gonna have a fun summer.’” she recalled. “And then I met Pete, and it was an amazing distraction. It was frivolous and fun and insane and highly unrealistic, and I loved him, and I didn’t know him. I’m like an infant when it comes to real life and this old soul, been-around-the-block-a-million-times artist. I still don’t trust myself with the life stuff.”

“I think that this is the first album [Thank U, Next] and also the first year of my life where I’m realizing that I can no longer put off spending time with myself, just as me,” she added. “I’ve been boo’d up my entire adult life. I’ve always had someone to say goodnight to. So Thank U, Next was this moment of self-realization. It was this scary moment of ‘Wow, you have to face all this stuff now. No more distractions. You have to heal all this shit.’”

Service Dogs have a particular bond with their owners/charges, mainly because they are often employed to keep their handler safe.

But what happens if you are approached by a service dog who has no owner present? The immediate thought is it has been abandoned or lost.

Advert 10

However, there’s a good reason why they’re coming to you and it could be the difference between life and death.

Thanks to a viral Tumblr post, which was shared by Melissa Hope on Twitter who wanted to spread this important message, you’ll now know what to do.

In Melissa Hope’s Twitter post she wrote:

Advert 10

If a service dog without a person approaches you, it means the person is down and in need of help.

The story comes after the original poster suffered a bad fall. Even though they were okay, their dog was under the impression they were in serious pain and went to go find another adult, as they have been trained to do.

The post went on to say:

Advert 10

I went after him after I had dusted off my jeans and my ego, and I found him trying to get the attention of a very annoyed woman. She was swatting him away and telling him to go away. Don’t get scared, don’t get annoyed, follow the dog! If it had been an emergency situation, I could have vomited and choked, I could have hit my head, I could have had so many things happen to me.

Since being posted the message has been shared over 154K times, in the hope people would get the message. People on Twitter also messaged her, thanking her for bringing it to the world’s attention.

One person wrote:

Advert 10

This is important. When I see a service dog, I try to stay as far out of their way as possible. They’re doing a job, after all. I’d shoo one away because I’d be fearful they weren’t doing their job.

Someone else thanked her:

Thanks for sharing this, I had no idea.

Another person said:

I had no idea….thanks for the heads up.

A spokesperson from Guide Dogs (UK) did clarify this is not an action they train their UK-based service dogs to perform.

While service dogs are more than happy to help those in need, as it’s what they’re trained to do, once in a while they need a break too. In April, volunteers from Canine Companions for Independence took a group of well-behaved service dogs on a field trip to Disneyland and the photos quickly went viral.

The non-profit organisation trains assistance dogs for children and adults with disabilities.

Once the pups have completed training, they’ll become fully-fledged service dogs, going out to people in need, all for free.

The majority of the dogs came from Sacramento and were raised by volunteers, including Laura Allen, who’s raised eleven puppies so far.

Speaking to ABC10, Allen revealed the dogs’ favourite part of the trip was meeting and greeting all the Disney characters.

She also stated how the outing is vital when it comes to training:

It’s great socialisation for the dogs. There are different sounds, people, kids.

Allen explained she regularly takes dogs to Disneyland but this is the first time they’ve got so much attention online.",What To Do If A Service Dog Approaches You Without An Owner
This is an ad disguised as an article for a radar detector. ,https://news.speedsociety.com/the-truth-behind-laser-and-radar-detectors/,"If there’s one market that can definitely be a little bit confusing at times, ...

If there’s one market that can definitely be a little bit confusing at times, it’s that of the radar detector. When you’re dropping your hard earned cash on something like this, you want to make sure that it’s an investment, after all, saving you the big bucks in the long run instead of just taking your money and letting it flow out of the window as you toss it into the breeze.

With many detectors, you might not even know what you’re getting and because of that, we had John, the President of Radenso Radar come out to give us the rundown of what they stand behind as the best radar on the market. In the long run, between tickets and insurance hikes because of violations this one could be smart to pick up for yourself.

Why is this thing so great? Well, with a plethora of features that are built right in, you’re basically safe from most real-world situations that are going to arise in your path, even protection from some of the most advanced technology that we’re sure some police departments don’t even have yet. In other words, where some might fall short, it really seems like this Radenso RC M has you covered.

It all starts out with what John describes to us as “the best sensitivity on the market,” meaning that if someone is trying to track down your speed, you’re getting the best possible chance to be alerted to that, this technology can detect radar and jam laser.

Now, we know that we can trust John’s word but in an age of lots of empty promises, both John and our crew here at Speed Society decided that it would probably be best to show this thing off and highlight its features in the real world. To be honest, with a Ford Raptor and the Speed Society giveaway SRT Viper, testing it out was a ton of fun.

If you dive in with the video below, you’ll be able to check out exactly what the police see on their screen when you’re running a product like this in your car and also what they might see with some of the other radar detectors on the market.

"He has a business degree and 94,000 followers on Instagram. ",https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/film-and-tv-whatever-happened-to-nerdy-greg-wuliger-from-everybody-hates-chris-20180615,"Everybody Hates Chris is one of the most underrated American sitcoms of recent years. The show was cancelled back in 2009, but it's remembered fondly by fans of titular comedian Chris Rock and general sitcom enthusiasts alike.

For many, the breakout star of the show was Vincent Martella, who starred as the young Chris' best friend (and the only person at high school who doesn't bully him) - the endearingly nerdy Greg Wuliger.

Despite the success of other actors who made their names in the show, however, Vincent has barely been seen on television since.



Advert 10

He provided the voice for Phineas Flynn in the long-running animated show Phineas and Ferb - as well as for the related video games, and a few Final Fantasy games as well - but his face has been almost completely absent from our screens.

However, images shared from his social media pages recently have proved that he's alive and well - and still getting work, thankfully. Vincent is still acting, largely in voice roles, and has even made brief appearances as secondary characters on shows such as The Walking Dead.

He's an avid Instagrammer, with just over 94,000 followers, and has completed a degree in business via the University of Florida.

And, of course, he's changed plenty since he portrayed the teenage Greg alongside Chris Rock. Still only 25 years old, he has gone from the gawkiest of gawky teens to, well, quite the cool kid. Nice work, mate.

While shows like Arrested Development, 30 Rock and Parks and Recreation have garnered justified critical acclaim, there hasn't been quite as much love for Chris Rock's comedy-memoir - probably because, unlike the others above, it isn't really edgy at all.

Loading…

Instead, it's a superbly observed, well-meaning and occasionally political show about the life of one black teenager in New York in the 1980s as he tries to deal with a wider white society, seen through his high school.

Influenza. ,https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/whats-the-deadliest-virus-in-the-world/,"Viruses aren’t automatically your enemy. These ambiguous, definition-bucking little beasties, found in every single environment on Earth, play a variety of roles – and the ancient precursor to one seems to play a role in how we form memories. Saying that, plenty of viruses can cause lethal infections in humans, with some being deadlier than others.

Without a doubt, influenza is the single biggest killer of them all. Back in 1918, between 50 and 100 million people died after being infected by the virus, which was around 5 percent of the planet’s population at the time. Overall, half a billion people were infected. Far from taking the lives of those that were otherwise vulnerable – the already sick, the elderly, or the very young – it spared no one.

There are several myths surrounding the pandemic, but it’s safe to say that it was the deadliest mass infection in human history. In fact, it’s something that plenty, including Bill Gates, have warned could happen again if we take our eye off the ball, or if we defund key agencies tasked with keeping the wolf from the door.

By total number of deaths, there’s no competition: The H1N1 strain of influenza virus is by far and away the most lethal in this respect. What if, though, we look at the mortality rate of viral infections instead – the number of infected people that ultimately die?

At a rough estimate, based on the high-end deaths value, H1N1’s case fatality rate (CFR) back then was roughly 20 percent. As it turns out, there are viruses that have frighteningly higher CFRs out there in the world today.

Take rabies, for example. This is a disease that, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), occurs in more than 150 countries around the world. It’s present on every single continent, except Antarctica, and 99 percent of human transmissions occur through dog bites. Children aged between 5 and 14 years are the most frequent victims.

Different variants have different incubation periods and epidemiologies. Those with “furious rabies” can become hyperactive and develop a fear of water and sometimes fresh air. A few days later, cardiorespiratory arrest occurs.

Those with paralytic rabies take longer to die. It begins to immobilize your muscles at the bite point, and eventually you fall into a coma and die as your brain and spinal cord continually inflame.",What's The Deadliest Virus In The World?

Romeo-Luis Ramirez shared on his Twitter account how he tried to refrigerate his drink since there were no means to do that in his office.

“Kung walang ref sa opis, lalamig ba ang inumin kapag nilambitin sa tapat ng aircon? Kung oo, gaano ka tagal?”

(Rough translation: If there’s no refrigerator in the office, will the drink get cold if it’s hung in front of the aircon? If yes, how long?”)

Ramirez is a pharmacist by profession and works as a research assistant at the Institute of Pharmaceutical science at the UP National Institutes of Health.

“I always rush in the morning to beat Manila traffic. Oftentimes, I fail to eat breakfast at home. Before going straight to the office, I pass by a bakeshop first to buy 2 egg pies, then walk across the street to buy 1 bottle of soya milk at a convenience store. It was already 2 pm that day when I realized that I forgot to drink my *supposedly chilled* soya.”

Ramirez realized that since there was no refrigerator in the office, he thought of using the aircon to chill his drink.

I grabbed a foot of scotch tape on the overhead shelf, wrapped it around the bottleneck of my soya, and left the whole thing hanging from the curtain blinds as seen in the picture. My null hypothesis was my drink couldn’t be cool again when directly placed in front of the aircon for some time. On the other hand, my alternative hypothesis was, my drink could be cool again like what it was when I bought it in the morning. Voila! After an hour of waiting that afternoon, I tried drinking from the bottle and observed a change in temperature, however not that significant. Only in my second hour of waiting, I can convincingly say to myself, “my drink is already cool enough to quench my thirst!” I bet this strategy isn’t new to some. For sure, others will only have to spend few minutes of waiting as long as the thermostat is set to maximum, and the master control is on “high cool”. In my case, I opted not to set the aircon’s settings to its fullest since I didn’t want my workmates and I freezing inside the office.

Needless to say, Ramirez’s experiment was successful.

$2.44 per day with an average commute. ,https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/06/how-much-it-costs-to-charge-a-tesla-model-x-each-day-in-australia/,"How Much It Costs To Charge A Tesla Model X Each Day

One of the key advantages of electric vehicles is not having to pay for petrol. This was particularly great for Tesla owners when charging stations were still free.

But for those who primarily charge at home on a daily basis, does it really work out cheaper?

Tesla recently crunched the numbers against the Model X 75D.

The auto manufacturer calculated that 7 kWh per day is enough to replenish the average daily commute. This number was drawn from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which calculated the average annual commute at roughly 15,000km.

This stat was then combined with average Australian energy prices obtained from Canstar Blue electricity and concluded that is costs approximately $2.44 per day to charge a Model X 75D. That $890.60 over the course of 12 months — which is a whole lot less than what I have ever paid for petrol.

There are also ways to bring this number further down — even if you don’t have solar panels and a Powerwall, which is another story entirely. AGL have a 12-month program that offers $1 per day for electric vehicle charging, which makes the total $365 for the first year. Tesla also offer 400 KWh Supercharger credits (roughly 1,600km) annually to Model S and X owners.

Of course, these numbers are based off general statistics and one particular Tesla model, so the numbers aren’t going to be entirely accurate. There are always outliers (It will cost a lot more if you’ve come back for a longer trip, for example) and Tesla owners are going differ when it comes to usage and charging behaviour — not to mention differences in electricity providers alone. Still, it’s good to have a petrol comparison, as well as a rough idea of how much an EV will add to your electricity bill over time.",How Much It Costs To Charge A Tesla Model X Each Day
"Spain. 

Stop Clickbait - Sports",https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-runs-100-000-russia-world-cup-simulations-to-pick-winner,"With the biggest event in the soccer calendar now underway, fans are speculating on which team might emerge victorious from the 2018 World Cup in Russia – and an artificial intelligence model based on 100,000 simulations has made its prediction too.

Using a database of statistics from previous tournaments, and three different AI methods to crunch the numbers, the international team of researchers behind the work thinks Spain is going to emerge victorious... but it's going to be close.

At the moment the bookmakers are backing Germany to be World Cup winners, but the AI analysed both the strength of the teams and their route to the final. While Germany would beat Spain in a one-off game, the models showed, the German team is likely to face more difficult opponents through the course of the competition.

""By analysing the winning probabilities conditional on reaching the single stages of the tournament, it turns out that the fact that overall Spain is slightly favoured over Germany is mainly due to the fact that Germany has a comparatively high chance to drop out in the round of 16,"" write the researchers.

The research team was made up of academics from Technische Universitat Dortmund, the Technical University of Munich in Germany, and Ghent University in Belgium.

They used three techniques to process the statistics: Poisson regression (interpreting and weighing many different variables), ranking method (evaluating the current strength of each team), and the random forest approach.

For the World Cup, the random forest method is particularly suitable. It can be structured like a football tournament, but its secret sauce is in the way it uses machine learning to map out random branches for a decision tree - different scenarios and their consequences - many times over.

By getting the AI to place emphasis on different factors when producing the decision trees, repeating the simulations and then comparing across factors, the forest method can give statisticians a better look at which factors are most important in the ultimate outcome - such as the opponents Germany and Spain are likely to face.

Compared with other mathematical models, it also gives more accurate information later on in the decision tree, where training data might be scarce.

The researchers plugged in a whole host of source data to inform their models. By looking back at previous tournaments, they found some factors were important (like the number of Champions League players on a team) and some were less so (like the nationality of a team's coach).

With the statistics showing a combination of ranking methods and random forest trees were the most accurate predictors, the 100,000 simulations of the 2018 World Cup were run based on these models.

Spain emerged at the top, with a 17.8 percent chance of winning. Germany is second on 17.1 percent, Brazil third on 12.3 percent, France fourth on 11.2 percent, and Belgium fifth on 10.4 percent.

Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has a zero percent chance of reaching the final. (Apologies to anyone rooting for them.)

Keep your eyes on your tournament wall charts though – should Germany make it through to the quarter finals, the last eight teams, the team has an equal chance with Spain.

The probabilities of teams progressing and winning. (arXiv.org)

Not everyone agrees with that assessment though. Financial firm Goldman Sachs has trained its own machine learning engines on the World Cup in Russia and reckons Brazil is going to emerge victorious. The Goldman Sachs calculations also involved elements of random forest modelling.

Of course soccer, and sport in general, has a long history of upsetting both bookmakers and AI models. It's very difficult to take into account everything that might affect a team's performance – and what machine learning algorithm can predict a spectacular goal being created out of nothing?

Still, it's interesting to look at the statistical methods involved in predicting what's going to happen in Russia. By the evening of the 15th of July, we'll know if those hundred thousand AI simulations got it right.

The study has yet to be peer-reviewed, but is available on the arXiv.org pre-print server.","An AI Has Simulated 100,000 World Cups And Discovered Who's Going to Win This Year"

You've probably heard of Wordle. But what the hell is a Wordle? Seen all those posts featuring yellow, green and gray boxes on social media? That's Wordle.

Here's everything you need to know...

What is Wordle?

Wordle is a daily word game you can find online here. It's fun, simple and, like a crossword, can only be played once a day. Every 24 hours there's a new word of the day, and it's up to you to figure out what it is. The site itself does a fantastic job of explaining the rules:

Wordle

Wordle gives players six chances to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. As shown above, if you have the right letter in the right spot, it shows up green. A correct letter in the wrong spot shows up yellow. A letter that isn't in the word in any spot shows up gray.

You can enter a total of six words, meaning you can enter five burner words from which you can learn hints about the letters and their placements. Then you get one chance to put those hints to use. Or you can try for performance and guess the word of the day in three, two or even one go.

Simple stuff, but also incredibly compelling.

So it's a word game? Big deal...

Yeah, it's just a word game. But it's super popular: Over 300,000 people play it daily, according to The New York Times. That popularity may sound perplexing, but there are a few tiny details that have resulted in everyone going absolutely bonkers for it.

There's only one puzzle per day: This creates a certain level of stakes. You only get one shot at the Wordle. If you mess up, you have to wait until tomorrow to get a brand new puzzle.

Everyone is playing the exact same puzzle: This is crucial, as it makes it easier to ping your buddy and chat about the day's puzzle. ""Today's was tough!"" ""How did you get on?"" ""Did you get it?"" Which takes us to the next point...

It's easy to share your results: Once you've successfully or unsuccessfully done the puzzle for the day, you're invited to share your Wordle journey for the day. If you tweet the image, it looks like this...

Choosing your first word: The first word is arguably the most important. To maximize the value of your opening gambit, choose a word with three vowels and five different letters. Some examples: orate, media, radio. I always use ""adieu"" for some reason. It's a habit and I'm refusing to break it.

I just finished reading a fascinating piece by Tyler Glaiel, a programmer and game designer who tried to figure out the best possible starting word. Apparently we should all be kicking off Wordle with the word ""roate."" Honestly, read this whole article, it's great.

Avoid reusing grays: There's a keyboard at the bottom of the Wordle board that shows what letters are green, yellow and gray. Avoid reusing letters that have come up gray. Yes, this sounds obvious. But it can take time and effort to think of five-letter words that don't use letters you've already tried. That effort will pay off.

Letters can appear twice: This complicates matters, especially when you're running out of letters to try on word four or five. But letters often recur, as with words like chill, sissy and ferry having been the correct answers in the past.

Who made Wordle?

Wordle is the work of software engineer Josh Wardle, who originally created the game for his partner, a fan of word games, and tells the BBC it will never become laden with ads. Extremely online people may remember Wardle as the creator of Place, an utterly wild collaborative art project/social experiment that sent the internet into a tizzy in April 2017.

Place was a shared online space that allowed literally anyone to fight over what was drawn there. It resulted in huge, sprawling communities battling over space on this gigantic online canvas.

It ultimately ended up looking like this:

Wordle got a mention in The New York Times in November, but really got traction when the share element got added.

In a Reddit post, Wardle said he wanted Wordle to feel like a croissant, a ""delightful snack"" that's enjoyed occasionally. This is explicitly why there's only one puzzle per day. ""Enjoyed too often,"" he explained, ""and they lose their charm,"" Wardle says.

Agreed.

New York Times acquisition

At the end of January, creator Josh Wardle sold Wordle to the New York Times for a figure ""in the low seven figures.""

Wardle noted that his ""game has gotten bigger than I ever imagined"" and added he's ""just one person.""



The game will ultimately become part of New York Times subscription puzzle service, but Wardle made sure that Wordle would remain free-to-play and that current streaks would be preserved in the move.

""It is important to me that, as Wordle grows, it continues to provide a great experience to everyone,"" Wardle said. ""Given this, I am incredibly pleased to announce that I've reached an agreement with The New York Times for them to take over running Wordle going forward.""

Wordle hasn't gotten harder since joining the New York Times

It just hasn't! Come on folks!



According to The New York Times: ""Nothing has changed about the game play,"" the Times' communications director, Jordan Cohen, said to CNET in an email.

If you check out the game's script you can see that the New York Times hasn't made any significant changes to the game.

Costco is great for bulk shopping including everything from food and drinks to electronics and prescriptions. But the big thing Costco stores lack isn’t a product or brand-named item—it’s express checkout.

recently asked Costco CEO W. Craig Jelinek some popular questions about the chain store, like if non-members will ever be allowed to shop and if the store will ever sell plus-size clothing. One key question on everyone’s minds? Why Costco doesn’t have express checkout lanes for people buying only one or two items. Jelinek says that an express lane isn’t the most cost-effective idea since so many shoppers are there to buy numerous items in large quantities, like these foods nutritionists always buy from Costco.

“Costco’s ability to sell merchandise at incredibly low prices is based on adhering to various operating disciplines at every turn,” Jelinek says. “Instead of having an express line—that often would be open but without a member in line—we have invested millions of dollars to speed up the entire front-end process.”

Jelinek continues to say that Costco policy indicates no more than one person in line and two behind. According to Jelinek, the average checkout time is just over one minute.

Walmart. ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grocery-store-worst-reputation-america-035713228.html,"Not all grocery stores are created equal. And according to a recent survey from Consumer Reports, more than 50,000 food shoppers have some serious complaints about specific stores.

Surveyors complained mostly about grocery stores with too few checkout lanes and long lines, congested aisles, too few food choices, and a poor selection of local products. Some of the worst offenders include Target, Aldi, and Stop and Shop. But the worst of the worst, according to survey results, is Walmart.

The discount chain store undoubtedly has competitive pricing. In fact, that's the one category where Walmart was highly ranked. The low overall ranking, however, stems from low rankings in seven out of 12 possible categories. This includes cleanliness, staff courtesy, checkout speed, produce and meat quality, and local produce selection. That's a far cry from the grocery store with the best reputation.

The superstore also came in last in the supermarket category in the most recent report by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Again, customers were dissatisfied with the slow checkout speed and unfriendliness of the staff. The stores taking the top spots on ACSI's report were Trader Joe's and Wegmans—these stores also show up consistently as being highly rated grocery stores in the United States for overall value, too.

Walmart has also faced criticism in the past for its poor relationship with workers. Business Insider reports that the company even spent more than $18 million on ads in 2017 to highlight recent investments and changes in company policy.

On the bright side, some popular stores did rank well. Fareway Stores, Wegmans, and Publix are amongst the top. Only about 23 to 30 percent of surveyors had a complaint about them—making them the least complained about in the ratings. Can't find one of these stores near you?

A toy gun (he has a current fascination with the police.) ,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Cambridge,"Son of the Duke of Cambridge, 3rd in line to the British throne

Prince George of Cambridge (George Alexander Louis; born 22 July 2013) is a member of the British royal family. He is the eldest child of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and is third in the line of succession to the British throne, behind his grandfather Prince Charles and his father. Due to his rank in the line of succession, and the subsequent expectation that he will one day become the British monarch, his birth was widely celebrated across the Commonwealth realms. George occasionally accompanies his parents on royal tours and engagements.

Birth and christening [ edit ]

George in the arms of his mother, July 2013

Prince George was born in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, London, at 16:24 BST (15:24 UTC) on 22 July 2013.[2] The birth was announced by press release, and was followed by the display of a traditional easel in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace.[2][3] The newborn was widely hailed as a future king in the majority of British newspapers.[4][5] 21-gun salutes signalled the birth in the capitals of Bermuda[6] and New Zealand;[7] the bells of Westminster Abbey and many other churches were rung;[8][9] and landmarks in the Commonwealth realms were illuminated in various colours, mostly blue to signify the birth of a boy.[10] On 24 July, his name was announced as George Alexander Louis.[11] Prince George's official title and style is ""His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge"",[12][13] which he has carried since birth, in accordance with Letters Patent dated 1898,[14] 1917,[15] and most recently 31 December 2012.[16]

George's father, the Duke of Cambridge, is the elder son of the Prince of Wales, who is the heir apparent to Queen Elizabeth II,[17] placing George third in the line of succession to the British throne.[18] Speculation ensued during the pregnancy of the Duchess of Cambridge that George's birth would boost the British national economy and provide a focus for national pride.[18] Commemorative coins were issued by the Royal Mint and the Royal Canadian Mint,[19][20] the first time a royal birth had been marked that way.[19] Prince George's birth marked the second time that three generations in direct line of succession to the throne have been alive at the same time, a situation that last occurred between 1894 and 1901, in the last seven years of the reign of Queen Victoria.[21]

George was christened by Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace on 23 October 2013, with Oliver Baker, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, Earl Grosvenor, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, Julia Samuel, William van Cutsem and Zara Tindall serving as godparents.[22][23] The font used at the ceremony was made for Queen Victoria's first child and the water was taken from the River Jordan.[24][25] Prince George spent his first months at his parents' cottage on the grounds of Bodorgan Hall in Anglesey, Wales, before his family relocated to Kensington Palace in 2014.[26][27] His younger siblings, Charlotte and Louis, were born in 2015 and 2018, respectively.[28]

Education [ edit ]

George's formal education began in January 2016, when, at the age of two, he began attending the Westacre Montessori School Nursery, near his family home at Anmer Hall in Norfolk.[29] He attended his first day of primary school on 7 September 2017 at the Thomas's School in Battersea.[30][31] He attends the school under the name of George Cambridge.[32]

Official appearances [ edit ]

George embarked on his first royal tour with his parents in April 2014, during which the Cambridges spent three weeks in New Zealand and Australia. Although he only appeared twice, the BBC described the ""nine-month-old future king"" as ""the star of the show"".[33] Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott predicted in Parliament House, Canberra, that George would one day be welcomed there as King of Australia.[33] In June 2015, he made his first public appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Trooping the Colour parade marking the Queen's Official Birthday.[34]

On 22 April 2016, George met U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama. He was photographed with a rocking horse that the Obamas had given him when he was born. The encounter later prompted Barack Obama to joke that ""Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe... a clear breach of protocol.""[35] George and his younger sister, Charlotte, accompanied their parents on a tour of Canada in September 2016,[36][37] and on a diplomatic visit to Poland and Germany in July 2017.[38]

In March 2020, Prince George joined his siblings, Charlotte and Louis, in an online video to applaud key workers during the coronavirus pandemic.[39] In September 2020, the children met David Attenborough; Kensington Palace subsequently released a video of them asking Attenborough questions regarding environmental conservation.[40][41] In December 2020, they made their first red carpet appearance accompanying their parents to the London Palladium for a performance of a pantomime held to thank key workers for their efforts during the pandemic.[42]

In 2021, he and his parents attended the England–Italy final of UEFA Euro 2020 at Wembley Stadium in London. He was referred to as a ""good-luck charm"" after England won an earlier game he attended.[43]

Public image [ edit ]

The ""Prince George effect"", sometimes known as the ""royal baby effect"", is a term used to describe an uptick in sales of clothing and other products used by George.[44] In 2016, the dressing gown that he wore while meeting President Obama sold out after he was seen wearing it.[45] In September 2017 the news that the Prince's school had served a Le Puy green lentil dish resulted in a spike in the sales of the legume.[46] He was ranked number 49 on GQ's ""50 Best Dressed Men in Britain"" list in 2015.[47] In 2018, George became the youngest person to appear on Tatler's best-dressed list.[48]

George's parents have been adamant about maintaining their son's privacy as he grows up.[49] In August 2015, Kensington Palace stated that they wanted all global media to stop taking unauthorised photographs of George, saying that ""a line [had] been crossed"" in paparazzi methods of locating and photographing him, including surveilling the family and sending children to bring George into view.[50]

In July 2018, an ISIS supporter and propagandist who had encouraged an attack on George's school in October 2017 was jailed for life with a minimum of 25 years.[51]

In the British satirical sketch programme Newzoids then toddler Prince George is depicted as a rebellious, foul mouthed character with a lewd sense of humour.[52] The 2016 children's book Winnie-the-Pooh Meets the Queen, written in honour of the 90th birthdays of both Queen Elizabeth II and the fictional character of Winnie-the-Pooh, features a cameo appearance from Prince George, whom Piglet presents a red balloon.[53] The 2021 animated sitcom The Prince stars a fictionalised eight-year-old Prince George (voiced by showrunner Gary Janetti) who makes life difficult both for his family and for the British monarchy.[54]

Taxes. ,https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-salary-breakdown-2018-6,"According to one estimate, LeBron James took home about half of his $33 million contract after taxes and other costs, giving a sense of how athletes are taxed compared with most people.

James was docked almost $13 million in taxes, plus another $4 million in other costs, according to the estimate.

James is estimated to make about $55 million off the court in endorsements and has the chance to become the highest-paid player in NBA history this offseason.

By now we know that most athletes' contracts aren't what they seem.

Though the numbers in the contracts are enormous, after federal, state, and local taxes, plus fees for agents and other costs, athletes usually ending up taking home close to half of their base salary.

ESPN's Darren Rovell broke down what LeBron James, the second-highest-paid player in the NBA this season, made from his $33 million contract. While it's still quite a big number, based on Rovell's estimate, it's less than half of that figure.

According to Rovell, James was docked $11.9 million in federal taxes, $2.1 million in state and city taxes, $950,000 in agent fees (agents usually collect 2-3% of player contracts), and another $18,000 in his 401(k) based on 2017 estimates.

James also lost an estimated $3.3 million to the NBA escrow, a 10% fee players pay to balance the basketball-related income split between themselves and the owners. James received some money back from the year before because revenues exceeded the forecast. (Read more on the escrow here).

James did, however, make some money back from last year's NBA escrow and a bit more in a shortfall.

In total, Rovell estimated that James made about $16.7 million this year.

Luckily for James, he's an even bigger earner off the court — it's been estimated he makes $55 million in endorsements.

James' situation is not unlike that of Stephen Curry, who also took home about half of his NBA-record $35 million salary.

Other professional athletes have said their salary numbers should be cut in half right from the get-go because of taxes. Los Angeles Rams defensive end Ndamukong Suh told Business Insider he didn't think the average person understood what athletes make and how many expenses they have.

It will take 4 billion years to get here. ,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole,"This article is about the astronomical object. For the song by the band Muse, see Supermassive Black Hole (song)

Largest type of black hole; usually found at the center of galaxies

[1][2] It shows 350 350 AU [3] The image was released in 2019 by the This is the first direct image of a supermassive black hole, located at the galactic core of Messier 87 It shows radio-wave emission from a heated accretion ring orbiting the object at a mean separation of, or ten times larger than the orbit of Neptune around the Sun. The dark center is the event horizon and its shadow.The image was released in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration.

A supermassive black hole (SMBH or sometimes SBH)[4] is the largest type of black hole, with its mass being on the order of millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun ( M ☉ ). Black holes are a class of astronomical objects that have undergone gravitational collapse, leaving behind spheroidal regions of space from which nothing can escape, not even light. Observational evidence indicates that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center.[5][6] For example, the Milky Way has a supermassive black hole in its Galactic Center, corresponding to Sagittarius A*.[7][8] Accretion of interstellar gas onto supermassive black holes is the process responsible for powering active galactic nuclei and quasars.[9]

Description [ edit ]

Supermassive black holes are classically defined as black holes with a mass above 0.1 million to 1 million M ☉ .[10] Some astronomers have begun labeling black holes of at least 10 billion M ☉ as ultramassive black holes.[11][12] Most of these (such as TON 618) are associated with exceptionally energetic quasars. Even larger ones have been dubbed stupendously large black holes (SLAB) with masses greater than 100 billion M ☉ .[13] Although they noted there is currently no evidence that stupendously large black holes are real, they noted that supermassive black holes almost that size do exist.[14] Some studies have suggested that the maximum mass that a black hole can reach, while being luminous accretors, is of the order of ~50 billion M ☉ .[15][16]

Supermassive black holes have physical properties that clearly distinguish them from lower-mass classifications. First, the tidal forces in the vicinity of the event horizon are significantly weaker for supermassive black holes. The tidal force on a body at a black hole's event horizon is inversely proportional to the square of the black hole's mass:[17] a person at the event horizon of a 10 million M ☉ black hole experiences about the same tidal force between their head and feet as a person on the surface of the earth. Unlike with stellar mass black holes, one would not experience significant tidal force until very deep into the black hole.[18] In addition, it is somewhat counterintuitive to note that the average density of a SMBH within its event horizon (defined as the mass of the black hole divided by the volume of space within its Schwarzschild radius) can be less than the density of water.[19] This is because the Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to its mass. Since the volume of a spherical object (such as the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole) is directly proportional to the cube of the radius, the density of a black hole is inversely proportional to the square of the mass, and thus higher mass black holes have lower average density.[20]

The Schwarzschild radius of the event horizon of a (nonrotating) supermassive black hole of ~1 billion M ☉ is comparable to the semi-major axis of the orbit of planet Uranus, which is 19 AU.[21][22]

History of research [ edit ]

The story of how supermassive black holes were found began with the investigation by Maarten Schmidt of the radio source 3C 273 in 1963. Initially this was thought to be a star, but the spectrum proved puzzling. It was determined to be hydrogen emission lines that had been red shifted, indicating the object was moving away from the Earth.[23] Hubble's law showed that the object was located several billion light-years away, and thus must be emitting the energy equivalent of hundreds of galaxies. The rate of light variations of the source dubbed a quasi-stellar object, or quasar, suggested the emitting region had a diameter of one parsec or less. Four such sources had been identified by 1964.[24]

In 1963, Fred Hoyle and W. A. Fowler proposed the existence of hydrogen burning supermassive stars (SMS) as an explanation for the compact dimensions and high energy output of quasars. These would have a mass of about 105 – 109 M ☉ . However, Richard Feynman noted stars above a certain critical mass are dynamically unstable and would collapse into a black hole, at least if they were non-rotating.[25] Fowler then proposed that these supermassive stars would undergo a series of collapse and explosion oscillations, thereby explaining the energy output pattern. Appenzeller and Fricke (1972) built models of this behavior, but found that the resulting star would still undergo collapse, concluding that a non-rotating 0.75×106 M ☉ SMS ""cannot escape collapse to a black hole by burning its hydrogen through the CNO cycle"".[26]

Edwin E. Salpeter and Yakov Zeldovich made the proposal in 1964 that matter falling onto a massive compact object would explain the properties of quasars. It would require a mass of around 108 M ☉ to match the output of these objects. Donald Lynden-Bell noted in 1969 that the infalling gas would form a flat disk that spirals into the central ""Schwarzschild throat"". He noted that the relatively low output of nearby galactic cores implied these were old, inactive quasars.[27] Meanwhile, in 1967, Martin Ryle and Malcolm Longair suggested that nearly all sources of extra-galactic radio emission could be explained by a model in which particles are ejected from galaxies at relativistic velocities; meaning they are moving near the speed of light.[28] Martin Ryle, Malcolm Longair, and Peter Scheuer then proposed in 1973 that the compact central nucleus could be the original energy source for these relativistic jets.[27]

Arthur M. Wolfe and Geoffrey Burbidge noted in 1970 that the large velocity dispersion of the stars in the nuclear region of elliptical galaxies could only be explained by a large mass concentration at the nucleus; larger than could be explained by ordinary stars. They showed that the behavior could be explained by a massive black hole with up to 1010 M ☉ , or a large number of smaller black holes with masses below 103 M ☉ .[29] Dynamical evidence for a massive dark object was found at the core of the active elliptical galaxy Messier 87 in 1978, initially estimated at 5×109 M ☉ .[30] Discovery of similar behavior in other galaxies soon followed, including the Andromeda Galaxy in 1984 and the Sombrero Galaxy in 1988.[5]

Donald Lynden-Bell and Martin Rees hypothesized in 1971 that the center of the Milky Way galaxy would contain a massive black hole.[31] Sagittarius A* was discovered and named on February 13 and 15, 1974, by astronomers Bruce Balick and Robert Brown using the Green Bank Interferometer of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.[32] They discovered a radio source that emits synchrotron radiation; it was found to be dense and immobile because of its gravitation. This was, therefore, the first indication that a supermassive black hole exists in the center of the Milky Way.

The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, provided the resolution needed to perform more refined observations of galactic nuclei. In 1994 the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble was used to observe Messier 87, finding that ionized gas was orbiting the central part of the nucleus at a velocity of ±500 km/s. The data indicated a concentrated mass of (2.4±0.7)×109 M ☉ lay within a 0.25″ span, providing strong evidence of a supermassive black hole.[33] Using the Very Long Baseline Array to observe Messier 106, Miyoshi et al. (1995) were able to demonstrate that the emission from an H 2 O maser in this galaxy came from a gaseous disk in the nucleus that orbited a concentrated mass of 3.6×107 M ☉ , which was constrained to a radius of 0.13 parsecs. Their ground-breaking research noted that a swarm of solar mass black holes within a radius this small would not survive for long without undergoing collisions, making a supermassive black hole the sole viable candidate.[34] Accompanying this observation which provided the first confirmation of supermassive black holes was the discovery[35] of the highly broadened, ionised iron Kα emission line (6.4 keV) from the galaxy MCG-6-30-15. The broadening was due to the gravitational redshift of the light as it escaped from just 3 to 10 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole.

On April 10, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration released the first horizon-scale image of a black hole, in the center of the galaxy Messier 87.[2]

In February 2020, astronomers reported that a cavity in the Ophiuchus Supercluster, originating from a supermassive black hole, is a result of the largest known explosion in the Universe since the Big Bang.[36][37][38]

In March 2020, astronomers suggested that additional subrings should form the photon ring, proposing a way of better detecting these signatures in the first black hole image.[39][40][41]

Formation [ edit ]

The origin of supermassive black holes remains an open field of research. Astrophysicists agree that black holes can grow by accretion of matter and by merging with other black holes.[42][43] There are several hypotheses for the formation mechanisms and initial masses of the progenitors, or ""seeds"", of supermassive black holes. Independently of the specific formation channel for the black hole seed, given sufficient mass nearby, it could accrete to become an intermediate-mass black hole and possibly a SMBH if the accretion rate persists.[44]

The early progenitor seeds may be black holes of tens or perhaps hundreds of solar masses that are left behind by the explosions of massive stars and grow by accretion of matter. Another model involves a dense stellar cluster undergoing core collapse as the negative heat capacity of the system drives the velocity dispersion in the core to relativistic speeds.[45][46]

Before the first stars, large gas clouds could collapse into a ""quasi-star"", which would in turn collapse into a black hole of around 20 M ☉ .[44] These stars may have also been formed by dark matter halos drawing in enormous amounts of gas by gravity, which would then produce supermassive stars with tens of thousands of solar masses.[47][48] The ""quasi-star"" becomes unstable to radial perturbations because of electron-positron pair production in its core and could collapse directly into a black hole without a supernova explosion (which would eject most of its mass, preventing the black hole from growing as fast).

A more recent theory proposes that SMBH seeds were formed in the very early universe each from the collapse of a Supermassive star with mass of around 100,000 solar masses.[49]

Large, high-redshift clouds of metal-free gas,[50] when irradiated by a sufficiently intense flux of Lyman–Werner photons,[51] can avoid cooling and fragmenting, thus collapsing as a single object due to self-gravitation.[52][53] The core of the collapsing object reaches extremely large values of the matter density, of the order of about 107 g/cm3, and triggers a general relativistic instability.[54] Thus, the object collapses directly into a black hole, without passing from the intermediate phase of a star, or of a quasi-star. These objects have a typical mass of about 100,000 M ☉ and are named direct collapse black holes.[55]

Finally, primordial black holes could have been produced directly from external pressure in the first moments after the Big Bang. These primordial black holes would then have more time than any of the above models to accrete, allowing them sufficient time to reach supermassive sizes. Formation of black holes from the deaths of the first stars has been extensively studied and corroborated by observations. The other models for black hole formation listed above are theoretical.

The formation of a supermassive black hole requires a relatively small volume of highly dense matter having small angular momentum. Normally, the process of accretion involves transporting a large initial endowment of angular momentum outwards, and this appears to be the limiting factor in black hole growth. This is a major component of the theory of accretion disks. Gas accretion is the most efficient and also the most conspicuous way in which black holes grow. The majority of the mass growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur through episodes of rapid gas accretion, which are observable as active galactic nuclei or quasars. Observations reveal that quasars were much more frequent when the Universe was younger, indicating that supermassive black holes formed and grew early. A major constraining factor for theories of supermassive black hole formation is the observation of distant luminous quasars, which indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed when the Universe was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.

[58] Artist's impression of stars born in winds from supermassive black holes.

There is an upper limit to how large supermassive black holes can grow. So-called ultramassive black holes (UMBHs), which are at least ten times the size of most supermassive black holes, at 10 billion solar masses or more, appear to have a theoretical upper limit of around 50 billion solar masses, as anything above this slows growth down to a crawl (the slowdown tends to start around 10 billion solar masses) and causes the unstable accretion disk surrounding the black hole to coalesce into stars that orbit it.[59][60][61][62]

Distant supermassive black holes, such as J0313–1806,[63] and ULAS J1342+0928,[64] are hard to explain so soon after the Big Bang. Some postulate they might come from direct collapse of dark matter with self-interaction.[65][66][67] A small minority of sources argue that they may be evidence that the Universe is the result of a Big Bounce, instead of a Big Bang, with these supermassive black holes being formed before the Big Bounce.[68][69]

Activity and galactic evolution [ edit ]

Gravitation from supermassive black holes in the center of many galaxies is thought to power active objects such as Seyfert galaxies and quasars, and the relationship between the mass of the central black hole and the mass of the host galaxy depends upon the galaxy type.[70][71]

An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is now considered to be a galactic core hosting a massive black hole that is accreting matter and displays a sufficiently strong luminosity. The nuclear region of the Milky Way, for example, lacks sufficient luminosity to satisfy this condition. The unified model of AGN is the concept that the large range of observed properties of the AGN taxonomy can be explained using just a small number of physical parameters. For the initial model, these values consisted of the angle of the accretion disk's torus to the line of sight and the luminosity of the source. AGN can be divided into two main groups: a radiative mode AGN in which most of the output is in the form of electromagnetic radiation through an optically thick accretion disk, and a jet mode in which relativistic jets emerge perpendicular to the disk.[72]

An empirical correlation between the size of supermassive black holes and the stellar velocity dispersion σ {\displaystyle \sigma } of a galaxy bulge[73] is called the M–sigma relation.

Evidence [ edit ]

Doppler measurements [ edit ]

[74] for Simulation of a side view of a black hole with transparent toroidal ring of ionized matter according to a proposed modelfor Sgr A* . This image shows the result of bending of light from behind the black hole, and it also shows the asymmetry arising by the Doppler effect from the extremely high orbital speed of the matter in the ring.

Some of the best evidence for the presence of black holes is provided by the Doppler effect whereby light from nearby orbiting matter is red-shifted when receding and blue-shifted when advancing. For matter very close to a black hole the orbital speed must be comparable with the speed of light, so receding matter will appear very faint compared with advancing matter, which means that systems with intrinsically symmetric discs and rings will acquire a highly asymmetric visual appearance. This effect has been allowed for in modern computer-generated images such as the example presented here, based on a plausible model[74] for the supermassive black hole in Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way. However, the resolution provided by presently available telescope technology is still insufficient to confirm such predictions directly.

What already has been observed directly in many systems are the lower non-relativistic velocities of matter orbiting further out from what are presumed to be black holes. Direct Doppler measures of water masers surrounding the nuclei of nearby galaxies have revealed a very fast Keplerian motion, only possible with a high concentration of matter in the center. Currently, the only known objects that can pack enough matter in such a small space are black holes, or things that will evolve into black holes within astrophysically short timescales. For active galaxies farther away, the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon. The technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies.

In the Milky Way [ edit ]

[75] Inferred orbits of 6 stars around supermassive black hole candidate Sagittarius A* at the Milky Way galactic center

Astronomers are confident that the Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, 26,000 light-years from the Solar System, in a region called Sagittarius A*[76] because:

The star S2 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter (closest distance) of 17 light-hours ( 1.8 × 10 13 m or 120 AU) from the center of the central object. [77]

or 120 AU) from the center of the central object. From the motion of star S2, the object's mass can be estimated as 4.1 million M ☉ , [78] [79] or about 8.2 × 10 36 kg .

, or about . The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S2 would collide with it. Observations of the star S14 [80] indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit.

indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. No known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain 4.1 million M ☉ in this volume of space.

Infrared observations of bright flare activity near Sagittarius A* show orbital motion of plasma with a period of 45±15 min at a separation of six to ten times the gravitational radius of the candidate SMBH. This emission is consistent with a circularized orbit of a polarized ""hot spot"" on an accretion disk in a strong magnetic field. The radiating matter is orbiting at 30% of the speed of light just outside the innermost stable circular orbit.[81]

On January 5, 2015, NASA reported observing an X-ray flare 400 times brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sagittarius A*. The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A*, according to astronomers.[82]

Outside the Milky Way [ edit ]

Unambiguous dynamical evidence for supermassive black holes exists only in a handful of galaxies;[84] these include the Milky Way, the Local Group galaxies M31 and M32, and a few galaxies beyond the Local Group, e.g. NGC 4395. In these galaxies, the mean square (or rms) velocities of the stars or gas rises proportionally to 1/ r near the center, indicating a central point mass. In all other galaxies observed to date, the rms velocities are flat, or even falling, toward the center, making it impossible to state with certainty that a supermassive black hole is present.[84] Nevertheless, it is commonly accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole.[85] The reason for this assumption is the M–sigma relation, a tight (low scatter) relation between the mass of the hole in the 10 or so galaxies with secure detections, and the velocity dispersion of the stars in the bulges of those galaxies.[86] This correlation, although based on just a handful of galaxies, suggests to many astronomers a strong connection between the formation of the black hole and the galaxy itself.[85]

The nearby Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away, contains a (1.1–2.3)×108 (110–230 million) M ☉ central black hole, significantly larger than the Milky Way's.[87] The largest supermassive black hole in the Milky Way's vicinity appears to be that of Messier 87 (i.e. M87*), at a mass of (6.4±0.5)×109 (c. 6.4 billion) M ☉ at a distance of 53.5 million light-years.[88][89] The supergiant elliptical galaxy NGC 4889, at a distance of 336 million light-years away in the Coma Berenices constellation, contains a black hole measured to be 2.1×1010 (21 billion) M ☉ .[90]

Masses of black holes in quasars can be estimated via indirect methods that are subject to substantial uncertainty. The quasar TON 618 is an example of an object with an extremely large black hole, estimated at 6.6×1010 (66 billion) M ☉ .[91] Its redshift is 2.219. Other examples of quasars with large estimated black hole masses are the hyperluminous quasar APM 08279+5255, with an estimated mass of 2.3×1010 (23 billion) M ☉ , and the quasar S5 0014+81, with a mass of 4.0×1010 (40 billion) M ☉ , or 10,000 times the mass of the black hole at the Milky Way Galactic Center.

Some galaxies, such as the galaxy 4C +37.11, appear to have two supermassive black holes at their centers, forming a binary system. If they collided, the event would create strong gravitational waves.[92] Binary supermassive black holes are believed to be a common consequence of galactic mergers.[93] The binary pair in OJ 287, 3.5 billion light-years away, contains the most massive black hole in a pair, with a mass estimated at 18 billion M ☉ .[94] In 2011, a super-massive black hole was discovered in the dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, which has no bulge. The precise implications for this discovery on black hole formation are unknown, but may indicate that black holes formed before bulges.[95]

On March 28, 2011, a supermassive black hole was seen tearing a mid-size star apart.[96] That is the only likely explanation of the observations that day of sudden X-ray radiation and the follow-up broad-band observations.[97][98] The source was previously an inactive galactic nucleus, and from study of the outburst the galactic nucleus is estimated to be a SMBH with mass of the order of a million solar masses. This rare event is assumed to be a relativistic outflow (material being emitted in a jet at a significant fraction of the speed of light) from a star tidally disrupted by the SMBH. A significant fraction of a solar mass of material is expected to have accreted onto the SMBH. Subsequent long-term observation will allow this assumption to be confirmed if the emission from the jet decays at the expected rate for mass accretion onto a SMBH.

A gas cloud with several times the mass of the Earth is accelerating towards a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.

In 2012, astronomers reported an unusually large mass of approximately 17 billion M ☉ for the black hole in the compact, lenticular galaxy NGC 1277, which lies 220 million light-years away in the constellation Perseus. The putative black hole has approximately 59 percent of the mass of the bulge of this lenticular galaxy (14 percent of the total stellar mass of the galaxy).[99] Another study reached a very different conclusion: this black hole is not particularly overmassive, estimated at between 2 and 5 billion M ☉ with 5 billion M ☉ being the most likely value.[100] On February 28, 2013 astronomers reported on the use of the NuSTAR satellite to accurately measure the spin of a supermassive black hole for the first time, in NGC 1365, reporting that the event horizon was spinning at almost the speed of light.[101][102]



In September 2014, data from different X-ray telescopes have shown that the extremely small, dense, ultracompact dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1 hosts a 20 million solar mass black hole at its center, accounting for more than 10% of the total mass of the galaxy. The discovery is quite surprising, since the black hole is five times more massive than the Milky Way's black hole despite the galaxy being less than five-thousandths the mass of the Milky Way.

Some galaxies lack any supermassive black holes in their centers. Although most galaxies with no supermassive black holes are very small, dwarf galaxies, one discovery remains mysterious: The supergiant elliptical cD galaxy A2261-BCG has not been found to contain an active supermassive black hole, despite the galaxy being one of the largest galaxies known; ten times the size and one thousand times the mass of the Milky Way. Since a supermassive black hole will only be visible while it is accreting, a supermassive black hole can be nearly invisible, except in its effects on stellar orbits.

In December 2017, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant quasar currently known, ULAS J1342+0928, containing the most distant supermassive black hole, at a reported redshift of z = 7.54, surpassing the redshift of 7 for the previously known most distant quasar ULAS J1120+0641.[103][104][105]

In February 2020, astronomers reported the discovery of the Ophiuchus Supercluster eruption, the most energetic event in the Universe ever detected since the Big Bang. It occurred in the Ophiuchus Cluster in the galaxy NeVe 1, caused by the accretion of nearly 270 million solar masses of material by its central supermassive black hole. The eruption lasted for about 100 million years and released 5.7 million times more energy than the most powerful gamma-ray burst known. The eruption released shock waves and jets of high-energy particles that punched the intracluster medium, creating a cavity about 1.5 million light-years wide - ten times the Milky Way's diameter.[106][36][107][108]

In February 2021, astronomers released, for the first time, a very high-resolution image of 25,000 active supermassive black holes, covering four percent of the Northern celestial hemisphere, based on ultra-low radio wavelengths, as detected by the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) in Europe.[109]

Hawking radiation [ edit ]

Hawking radiation is black-body radiation that is predicted to be released by black holes, due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation reduces the mass and energy of black holes, causing them to shrink and ultimately vanish. If black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation, a supermassive black hole with a mass of 1011 (100 billion) M ☉ will evaporate in around 2×10100 years.[110] Some monster black holes in the universe are predicted to continue to grow up to perhaps 1014 M ☉ during the collapse of superclusters of galaxies. Even these would evaporate over a timescale of up to 10106 years.[111]

If your sole exposure to anchovies has been seeing their floppy bodies desecrating an “otherwise perfectly good” pizza, hold tight a sec: You haven’t been eating them at their best. (You wouldn’t eat raw garlic, right?) As the Queen of Italian Cookery goes on to explain, anchovies are most delightful when they are smashed and allowed to complement something else.

Anchovies are major players in Spanish, Italian, French and Greek cuisine. Hazan’s cookbook is one of many exhorting the flexibility of the silvery little fish. Anchovies and white wine can sauce a fillet of halibut. Or dissolve into a sauce of butter and capers for veal scaloppine. Or garnish beef patties. It’s clear Hazan thinks the sky’s the limit.

She’s not alone. We’ve witnessed an anchovy comeback over the last few years. Chef Seamus Mullen’s cookbook Hero Food devoted a whole chapter to their charms, lauding their health benefits—they’re high in protein, vitamins D and E, calcium, and omega-3s—as he laces them on toasts and flatbreads. Chef Jody Williams, at her French restaurant Buvette, layers anchovies with salted butter on warm toasts. And chef Alex Raij, of Spanish restaurants La Vara and Txikito, loves them with cheese, on garlic bread with tomato, and even in pasta.

A good primer on buying anchovies is here, but in a nutshell: Anchovies vary wildly in quality, from the big fat fillets and whole fish to the little oily tins you can get at the supermarket. I’d suggest you buy both. Get to know them. And don’t forget to store them in the refrigerator, as they’re perishable. Although those $2 tins from brands such as Cento and Roland are cheap, they’re delicious—especially when you break them down, mingle them with a fat like butter or olive oil, and introduce them to meat or vegetables.

After going gaga for the bite of butter, anchovies and bread at Buvette, I was determined to eat more anchovies. I tried the excellent garlic-butter-anchovy-chicken recipe in Alison Roman’s book Dining In. Incredible. But perhaps my favorite application is Melissa Clark’s chicken recipe from The New York Times. Bright capers, sautéed garlic, and lemon juice combine with plenty of anchovies, olive oil, and tender chicken thighs. The anchovies break down over high heat, eliminating their finicky texture. It was so good—bright, salty, and satisfying—I actually began cursing, aloud and alone, at my lunch plate. Later, I found myself sneaking into the fridge to break off cold pieces of chicken for myself.

As Clark emailed Health when asked how the inspiration for the recipe hit her, “It's one of my favorites. It's actually a riff on the classic Italian lamb chops sautéed with anchovies and capers.” She used chicken instead of lamb to make it “more economical and accessible.”

Of the enduring charms of the little fish, she writes, “Put anchovies in EVERYTHING!” She even has them folded into baked Brie in her next cookbook. Now that’s anchovy commitment.

Her forehead got stretched. Picture in comments. ,https://awkward.com/passport-office-screws-up-womans-id-photo-in-the-most-hilarious-way/,"Unless you’re a supermodel, you’ve probably taken a bad ID photo or two in your lifetime. Maybe you had an acne outbreak the morning you got your driver’s license, or you sneezed the exact moment the photo was taken, or, like me, the moment you set foot inside a DMV you completely forget how to smile. And then, every time you have to show your ID, is a brand new opportunity to embarrass yourself in front of a total stranger.

So when a young woman named Chelsey managed to take a flattering photo for her passport, she thought she’d beaten the system.

She was wrong.

Chelsey and her boyfriend Reece were getting ready for a trip to Germany later this year, so they went to Costco to get passport photos taken. Here’s the photo Chelsey submitted to the passport office:

That’s a good passport photo! Not embarrassing at all.

But when the passports arrived a few weeks later, Chelsey discovered that her photo had been “distorted.” To put it mildly:

Somewhere a hat maker is looking at this and thinking “Challenge accepted.”

That’s just brutal, man. Here’s the side-by-side for the full effect:

The term “fivehead” doesn’t go nearly far enough. This is a minimum “sixhead.”

According to Reece, his girlfriend was none too pleased. “Chelsey was furious,” he told The Huffington Post. “And rightly so. She paid good money for an official ID from the State Department and it came out wrong, completely wrong, wouldn’t-pass-through-customs wrong.”

For his part, Reece was able to see the humor in the situation.

“As soon as I saw it I just started laughing,” he said. “It’s one of the funniest ‘bloopers’ I’ve ever seen … and it wasn’t mine!”

(By the way, if you’re in a relationship, you know that Reece’s reaction is the correct one.)

Reece then posted the passport screwup to Reddit, prompting some pretty solid jokes:

“When she sleeps she doesn’t have dreams, she has movies.”

“She looks like she could tell you the 5 billionth digit of pi without even breaking a sweat.”

And, “You’re dating a Conehead? Are her parental units cool with it?”

Strangely, this isn’t even the first time the State Department has done this. One man shared his own “Conehead-ed” photo:

How does this even happen?!

Lucky for Chelsey, the State Department has been working to rectify the situation. She contacted them about the mixup and they agreed to issue a new passport with the correct photo.

The only real loser is the German customs official who won’t get to see this.

However, one woman is maintaining her strong belief, rapper Eminiem is her real father. She even has ‘proof’.

Appearing on the Dr Phil show, 20-year-old Haley stuck firm to her conviction he is her father.

The young woman also half believed Dr Phil could be her uncle (which would make him related to Slim…).

Advert 10

Trying to get his head round the idea in a logical, common sense kind of way, Dr Phil said:

I’ve been on television for 20 years – five years on Oprah then 15 years on my own show. Do you think that, some time through the last 20 years, somebody might’ve mentioned ‘by the way, your dad’s brother is Dr Phil’?

Haley replied:

There’s a lot of things that I think that people say that I’m just crazy for, but that’s what I think.

Cutting to the point, Dr Phil asks ‘would that make me Eninem’s brother?’

To which Haley replies:

Would it? […] No that’d probably make you his dad.

Advert 10

If Dr Phil was Eminem’s dad, we’d probably have heard about it right?

Haley said:

Well, people that are famous usually tend to not say ‘hey, this is my dad, he’s famous too’. Sometimes they have kids that they don’t even know about.

As Dr Phil tries to get to the heart of the matter, Haley’s ‘proof’ appears in the form of a photograph of Eminem next to a photograph of her dad who ‘they call Mikey’.

Check it out here:

Mikey, fortunately, has provided a statement on the matter.

He wrote:

My name is Michael Kristi [Haley’s mother] is my half-sister… I am Haley and Adrianna’s uncle. I am not Eminem but I did look like him and was mistaken for him in my 20s.

Haley, however, still can’t quite get her head around it.

After hearing the statement, she says:

He looks just like him, there’s no way.

I don’t know what to tell you Haley.

Perhaps this sign language translator can spell it out for you, as she seems to know a thing or two about Eminem.

A video of her converting Eminem’s lyrics into visuals – in real time live at a concert nonetheless – went viral recently.

Check it out:

The interpreter, named Holly Maniatty, has been praised for her awesome sign language skills and ability to translate Slim’s lyrics for the hearing-impaired.

Eminem, 45, also known as Marshall Mathers, has sold an eye-watering 172 million albums worldwide, and while he does have a daughter, also called Hailie, it’s definitely not the one who was just on Dr Phil (the different spelling of their names might be just one giveaway.)

In fact, Eminem and daughter Hailie Jade Scott have been spending some quality time together at music festivals across America this year.

The 22-year-old has been ‘crashing’ dates on her dad’s tour, crystallising the special moments with pictures, not of her weird uncle, but with the real Slim Shady.",Girl Claims She Has Proof Eminem Is Her Real Dad
42 times. ,https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/marvel-fan-avengers-infinity-war-watch-record/,"When people love movies, they might go see them in theaters a few more times than just one. One Marvel fan, though, has gone back to the theaters to see Avengers: Infinity War 42 times and counting.' Going by Nem: The Infinity Watcher on Twitter, the Charlotte native video game streamer and independent music creator has gone to see the Marvel Studios ensemble flick more than anyone else and has the receipts to prove it. On Wednesday, Nem went to his local theater to see it for the 42nd time, posing in front of the Avengers: Infinity War poster with a Black Panther t-shirt on. Check it out...

Surely, this isn't real, right? Wrong. Nem has all of the supporting evidence.

Don't cover the stroller. Saved you a click and potentially a baby's life. ,https://www.todaysparent.com/baby/baby-health/the-dangerous-stroller-mistake-parents-make-in-the-summer/,"You want to keep your baby cool on hot spring or summer days, but make sure you don't do this when you go out for a walk.

Throwing a cover over the stroller when out and about with your baby might seem like an obvious way to keep her cool and protected from the sun on a hot summer day. (Since babies under six months can’t wear sunscreen, many moms and dads make sure the stroller is fully shaded.) But some parents are actually making matters worse, says Svante Norgren, a paediatrician at the Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital in Stockholm. Norgren told a local newspaper that even a thin muslin blanket can make conditions inside a stroller uncomfortably hot, and put your baby at risk. “It gets extremely hot down in the pram, something like a thermos,” Norgren told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.

The newspaper tested Norgren’s theory and found that after 90 minutes, an uncovered buggy heated up to 22 degrees, while a stroller with a thin covering reached 34 degrees in just 30 minutes. After an hour in the sun, it was a scary 37 degrees.

These findings don’t surprise Anne Rowan-Legg, a paediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and assistant professor in the paediatrics department at the University of Ottawa. She says it’s a lack of airflow that causes the temperatures inside covered strollers to soar. “Temperatures can rise quite quickly in a confined covered space, just like in a car,” she says. And that can pose a serious risk to little ones.

“Babies and young children are more vulnerable to the heat than older children and adults,” says Rowan-Legg. That’s because they sweat less, their ability to regulate body temperature is less efficient and they can’t tell you when they’re feeling too hot. This puts them at increased risk of heat-related illness, dehydration, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

Infants and young children who are suffering from exposure to extreme heat may show signs of faintness, extreme tiredness and intense thirst. Other signs of heat-related illness include vomiting, quick breathing and restlessness, and heat can make existing illnesses or medical conditions worse.

That doesn’t mean you have to be cooped up during a heat wave, though. Keep little ones safe while you stroll by following these guidelines:

-Instead of a blanket, use a large canopy, or a mesh or perforated sun shield designed for strollers. These will keep baby shaded while ensuring adequate airflow.

-Dress baby in lightweight, loose-fitting clothing.

-Give your baby more fluids than usual, to keep him hydrated.

-Avoid peak hours and stick to the shade as much as possible.

-Check on little ones often, feeling their skin to ensure they’re cool.

If you don’t have air conditioning at home to help your family cool off after an outing, be strategic and plan breaks at a coffee shop or café with AC. “Seek comfort at a public library, the mall or a community shelter provided especially for relief from the heat,” says Rowan-Legg.",The dangerous stroller mistake parents make in the hot weather

Laurel. ,https://www.iflscience.com/brain/the-guy-behind-the-laurel-or-yanny-clip-reveals-what-he-actually-said/,"It’s the audio illusion that divided the Internet. Was it Laurel or was it Yanny?

First shooting to the fore last week, the short clip of a person saying one of those two names caused chaos. Some heard one word, others heard the other, and some could switch between the two, drawing obvious similarities to The Dress.

The exact cause of this difference isn’t entirely clear. Some have suggested that it may be the result of the bass on your speakers. Raising or lowering the volume can apparently trigger the switch from one name to the other.

Others have said this is a “perceptually ambiguous stimulus”, meaning that the brain can’t decide which one is right. Your age may play a factor in deciding which one you hear, as could the word you’re actually expecting to hear.

One researcher is even conducting a survey to try and get to the bottom of it. Pascal Wallisch from New York University told IFLScience he would be conducting a study to try and settle Yannygate once and for all.

This does beg the question though, what was the voice that originally said the word actually saying? That, my friend, has been answered.

-

The recording was made by 64-year-old actor-singer Jay Aubrey Jones for the website Vocabulary.com. They were looking for people to say words into a microphone to help teach people new words. And on this occasion in 2007, they asked Jones to say quite a few, including this one: Laurel.

“I recorded my batch of words,” he told Time, “and I thought that was that.”

Yes, that’s right. The original word spoken was “Laurel”, which makes the Yannygate thing all the weirder. It wasn’t recorded with an illusion in mind, but merely one of thousands of words in a day’s work.

Jones, for his part, mostly hears Laurel, although he said he can also hear “a slight trace of ‘Yanny’”. And he said it made him laugh that people were so interested in the recording, considering “all the things that are going on in the world right now.”

So there you have it, straight from the speaker’s mouth himself. Now we can put these audio illusion things to bed. Ah, wait.","The Guy Behind The ""Laurel or Yanny"" Clip Reveals What He Actually said"

A vegetarian diet. ,https://www.sciencealert.com/third-of-early-deaths-could-be-prevented-with-diet-change-vegetarian,"Up to a third of early deaths could be prevented if we all switched to a vegetarian diet, according to new calculations by Harvard Medical School scientists.

While we already know about many of the benefits of not eating meat, this latest figure is much higher than previous estimates.

The researchers presented the figures at the Unite to Cure Fourth International Vatican Conference in Vatican City last week.

The work is yet to be published in a peer reviewed journal, so we need to be skeptical about these numbers for now. But such bold claims are worth further investigation.

Estimates vary between countries but roughly 30 million deaths every year across the globe are classed as ""preventable"" – those caused by things we can arguably do something about, such as obesity, smoking, poor diet, and so on.

Cutting those numbers down by a third would be a massive achievement.

And according to researchers from Harvard Medical School, switching to a plant-based diet could play a bigger part in that than previously realised.

""We have just been doing some calculations looking at the question of how much could we reduce mortality shifting towards a healthy, more plant based diet, not necessarily totally vegan, and our estimates are about one third of deaths could be prevented,"" said one of the team, Walter Willett, as reported by The Telegraph.

""That's not even talking about physical activity or not smoking, and that's all deaths, not just cancer deaths. That's probably an underestimate as well as that doesn't take into account the fact that obesity is important and we control for obesity.""

As we mentioned earlier, we haven't seen a paper on this yet, and other scientists have yet to analyse the figures produced by Willett and his colleagues.

Even so, other attendees at the conference agreed that a vegetarian diet could do more for stopping preventable deaths than previous studies suggested.

In short, a healthier diet has a knock-on effect on almost every other aspect of the body's health.

David Jenkins, from the University of Toronto in Canada, was also at the Unite to Cure event and presented research looking at lowland gorilla diets – rich in stems, leaves, vines and fruit.

When the same diet was recreated for humans, it led to a 35 percent fall in their cholesterol in just two weeks.

So what is it that makes these diets so good for us?

The nutrients in a properly managed vegetarian diet are known to lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of a heart attack, and lower body mass index (BMI).

At the same time, studies have shown that eating certain red meats increases your risk of cancer.

Add to that the environmental benefit of not having livestock to look after and manage, and the benefits of a meat-free diet quickly begin to stack up.

At the same time, vegetarians also need to be careful about what they eat – particularly in making sure they get the protein, calcium, iron, and vitamin B12 typically provided by meats. So it's definitely not a case of one diet being perfect for all humans.

What this latest research suggests is that cutting back on meat could be better for us than we ever realised – at least in terms of avoiding an early death. And that could help inform all of our diets, whether we completely give up meat or not.

""I think people imagine that a healthy diet has only a modest effect and a vegetarian diet might help you lose a little bit of weight,"" Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, told the conference, as The Telegraph reports.

""But when these diets are properly constructed I think they are enormously powerful.""","A Third of Early Deaths Could Be Prevented by This Diet Change, Say Harvard Scientists"
"“I would have done one more fitting!"" ",http://www.mtv.co.uk/meghan-markle/news/the-one-thing-katy-perry-didnt-like-about-meghan-markles-wedding-dress,"Katy Perry has taken a dig at Meghan Markle’s wedding dress after claiming that the Givenchy gown she wore to marry Prince Harry could have done with at least “one more fitting.”

While most people were loving the simplistic pen bateau neckline and vaguely cinched in waist, the 33-year-old singer felt that the ensemble could’ve looked a hell of a lot better if it had been slightly more fitted.

Let's get checking out a bunch of regular guys trying eyebrow makeup for the first time...

In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Katy responded: “I would have done one more fitting!” when questioned about the dress, before going on to give a cheeky wink down the camera.

Designer Clare Waight Keller, who became the first female artistic director of Givenchy last year, said of the creation: “There was a conversation early on about the story that we were going to tell through this wedding.

“Part of what I wanted to do was talk to her about what type of stories they could be,"" she told People. ""The fact that her and Prince Harry will be working a lot in the Commonwealth was something that I thought was really intriguing and could be something built on to be part of the day.”

Meghan also paid tribute to Britain by wearing a six-foot veil made up of flowers from each of the fifty-two Commonwealth countries, before finishing off the look with a gorgeous Queen Mary Diamond Bandeau tiara made in 1932.

Reduce stress. Saved you 5 clicks. ,https://www.iflscience.com/brain/want-lose-weight-train-brain-not-body/,"Despite massive government, medical and individual efforts to win the war on obesity, 71 percent of Americans are overweight. The average adult is 24 pounds heavier today than in 1960. Our growing girth adds some US$200 billion per year to our health care expenditure, amounting to a severe health crisis.

Drug research has not yielded a pill that helps people lose weight and keep it off. Traditional approaches such as diet and exercise can work short-term, but people almost inevitably regain the weight. Randomized controlled trials of weight loss surgery have shown some improvements in diabetes but not in mortality, cancer and cardiovascular disease.

If there is ever to be a “pill” – a solution to weight – it will be changing the brain, particularly the primitive areas of the brain, the “emotional brain” or mammalian and reptilian brain. These areas house circuits that control stress and our stress-fueled emotions, thoughts and behaviors. These circuits can be rewired in humans so by changing them, we have a chance to address the root cause of stress-related problems, including obesity. While some overweight and obesity are caused by genetic make-up, more and more research is indicating that stress plays a big role in weight gain. Many people under stress turn to food for comfort.

My colleagues and I set out to develop a neuroscience-based approach to weight management and dealing with the common excesses we all face, through emotional brain training. The idea was to use neuroscience-based tools to change the brain so that the whole range of common excesses would fade.

Not in Switzerland though.

If you happen to move to Switzerland, it’s important to remember that those living there for more than a year, will need to exchange their driving licence for a Swiss one. And as in all countries, you will have to pass a practical driving test. But what happens when you fail the exam? (the article continues after the ad)

According to a Swiss law, if you fail the practical driver’s license test three times, you are required to consult an official psychologist to assess the reasons for your previous failures before you are allowed to retake the exam! Once the psychologist reports that you are once again ready to take the exam, you can retry.

Now that’s a weird law, isn’t it?

Here's Why Flight Attendants Ask You to Raise the Window Shade

When flying, passengers are often subjected to various rules and regulations with purposes that are not immediately clear. Why do fliers need to have their seat backs straight for take off and landing? Does an active cellphone really interfere with the plane’s signal? Why do window shades have to be raised for landing?

For the window shade question, at least, we now finally have an answer. According to CN Traveler, “the reason fliers have to open and close their window shades is not for the amusement of the flight attendant, better views of the world below, for sunburn protection, or to prepare you for that jolt of landing: it’s primarily for safety.”

In case of an emergency, flight attendants are tasked with the daunting feat to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less—according to U.S. regulations. Passengers are asked to keep their window shades open during take off and landing as these are when most aviation accidents occur, and the windows allow flight crew to assess an emergency situation and determine which exit is best used.

Natural light is also a factor in a smooth emergency exit. “By allowing natural light to flood into the cabin, a sudden exit into the sunny outdoors is less disorienting for passengers and crew alike, and evacuees, the thinking goes, will be better able to move away from the plane,” reports Kristen Leigh Painter of CN Traveler.",Here's Why Flight Attendants Ask You to Raise the Window Shade
It's the neighborhood cat. Pictures in comments. ,https://www.boredpanda.com/cat-willow-bring-pink-flowers-gift-neighbors/,"Who doesn’t like getting flowers? Regularly? From a secret admirer? That’s a classic recipe for getting through the day, no doubt. When Rosie from the UK noticed pink flowers regularly appearing on her terrace, she had no clue who had been behind them. One day, however, the cat was let out of the bag.

It was Willow, her neighbors’ kitty! “For a while, it was just a legend that it was her until yesterday when I was cooking and spotted her jumping down with a pink flower in her mouth,” Rosie told Love Meow. “I was so excited that I went to film it because she’s so cute and I’d never seen a cat ever bring back anything but dead animals before.”

Willow loves everyone, and everyone loves Willow. She frequently visits people from all over the area and in return they give the kitty treats and pets. Sometimes, even a spot on their couch!

This is what the owner of this lawn, Rosie, sees almost every day

A romantic gesture of a neighbor cat, Willow, who always shows up with pink flowers in her mouth

“We live on a street of terraced houses that backs onto another street of terraced houses with a kind of garden corridor between”

“Willow rules over about six of the gardens, and I’m pretty sure she gets fed by everyone because she’s very difficult to say no to”

“For a while, It was just a legend that it was her until yesterday when I was cooking and spotted her jumping down with a pink flower in her mouth”

“I’d never seen a cat ever bring back anything but dead animals before”

“She clearly likes us because she steals flowers from (her owners) and leaves them on our deck”

The lovely kitty has been visiting Rosie since she moved into the house

And since early spring, the flowers have been coming

“It was at least ten flowers before we realized it was her”

These romantic gestures have earned a special place in Rosie’s heart

And Willow has become a frequent visitor in her house

Who could say no to such a cutie?

Maybe Willow is thinking about becoming a full-time gardener?

Family of Two Sarah and Andy Justice were happy and loved their life together. They always knew they wanted to grow their family and become parents. After years of trying to conceive, Sarah and Andy decided to give adoption a try. After an excruciating process, the couple was finally given babies. This tearjerking real-life story of what happened right after the adoption will be sure to surprise you.

Pregnancy Trouble After three years of marriage, the Justices felt something was missing. They decided it was time to grow their family. Unfortunately, having babies was not easy for the Justices. For three long years, the sweet couple tried to have babies naturally with no success. Struggling to get pregnant began to put a strain on their marriage. Times were tough but they finally decided it was time to try something else. Sarah and Andy tried to find a fertility doctor.

Fertility Expert Sarah and Andy Justice lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Once they decided to go to a fertility specialist, the couple had trouble finding a good fertility specialist in their hometown. Eventually, they found a doctor that could help them get pregnant, but there was one inconvenience. The fertility specialist they wanted was all the way in St. Louis, MO. Even though the distance posed a problem, Sarah and Andy were determined to have kids and they would not let anything get in their way.

More Bad News Getting to Missouri from Oklahoma for fertility treatment was quite a mission for Sarah and Andy. The year was 2014 and the couple left their home in Tulsa, Oklahoma and trekked to a doctor’s office in Missouri. The Justices were so determined to get pregnant that they drove for six long hours to reach the fertility expert in Missouri. Sadly, once they arrived in Missouri, Sarah and Andy received disappointing news. The visit was not successful and it seemed that there was no change Sarah could get pregnant.

In Vitro The fertility specialist had some unfortunate news for the Justices. The specialist told Sarah and Andy that even though they were good candidates for in-vitro fertilization, their chance of getting pregnant was still only 10%. Also, the process of in-vitro fertilization was much more invasive than the couple realized. Besides being really invasive, in-vitro fertilization is also incredibly expensive. Still, the Justices were not out of luck. Even though plan A and plan B did not work out, they were ready to turn to plan C!

Too Expensive The process of in vitro fertilization is not cheap at all and can range from about $12,000- $15,000 for a basic IVF cycle. The fertility treatment is rarely covered by insurance. If the Justices went through with IVF, they found out they would have to pay between $30,000 and $60,000 just to try to get pregnant. The high cost and the low likelihood that IVF would work had the Justices thinking outside of the box. Adoption became the logical next step.

Adoption Andy and Sarah would stop at nothing to become parents. Because the Justices wanted to be parents more than anything they decided to begin the adoption process. As many people know, the adoption process can be grueling and at times even as frustrating as trying to conceive naturally. Way before the point of bringing a child home, the Justices first needed to apply to an adoption agency. Then, once the agency reviews and accepts the application, Sarah and Andy had to complete a home study.

Anything for a Baby Every step of the way, the Justices were met with hurdles to jump over. All they wanted was to provide a wonderful home for a child, but adoption is no easy process. While the adoption route presented many more obstacles to get through, Sarah and Andy would stop at nothing to figure out a way to have children. They knew that getting through the adoption system could take years. Nevertheless, Sarah and Andy wanted a newborn baby and were determined to do anything.

Interviews After applying to an adoption agency and going through a home study, the next step is to interview. Just thinking about interviews gives most people some anxiety, but they are a huge part of the adoption process. Sarah and Andy had to go through a series of interview with prospective birth mothers. These high-pressure interviews would determine whether or not the Justices would be able to adopt a baby. By the end, the Justices were drained and exhausted. Unfortunately, Sarah and Andy’s struggle was not even close to over.

Seeking Approval After an extensive interview process, the Justices finally got some good news. One birth mom decided to give the Justices her baby! Sarah and Andy could not believe the good news. All they wanted was to hold their new child! The Justices made sure to support the birth mother through her pregnancy, they couldn’t wait to meet their new family member. Sadly, just as their dream of having a baby began to come to fruition, things took a turn for the worst.

Last Minute Change Just when Sarah and Andy thought they were done waiting for a baby, the birth mom changed her mind at the last minute. The birth mother decided to keep the baby, and the devastating news completely broke the Justices. Even though Sarah and Andy were heartbroken, they decided to move on and try again. The resilient couple was nowhere near ready to give up and move on. Sarah and Andy knew they were meant to be parents.

Moving On Still, in the midst of heartache and disappointment, Sarah and Andy decided to push on with the adoption process. They recontacted the adoption agency and let them know they still wanted to adopt. The Justices went on another interview and found another birth mother that wanted to give her baby to the Justices. Again, just as things were moving forward, the second birth mother backed out of the plan and decided to keep her baby at the last minute.

Overcoming Obstacles Understandably, Sarah and Andy were disappointed and almost completely discouraged. Still, they continued to pray for the family they wanted. Somehow, the couple persevered and found the strength within themselves to keep trying. No matter what happened, the Justices would never be ready to call it quits. Little did they know that good news was right around the corner. Very shortly after the second birth mom backed out of the adoption, Andy and Sarah received one more call.

One Last Chance Just at the moment when the Justices were at their lowest, Sarah received a call that would change the course of her and Andy’s life. For the first time in a while, the phone rang with good news. Again the agency called to let the Justices know that there was a pregnant woman who chose Sarah and Andy to be the parents of her unborn child. There was something different about this birth mother that seemed promising.

Babies The Justices met with the birth mom and she even included them in an ultrasound appointment with her. While Sarah and Andy and the birth mother were at the doctor’s appointment, something peculiar showed up on the scan. At first, the Justices were nervous, but this time the surprise was a good one! Everything looked normal and the baby was healthy…or should we say, babies! The doctor saw three separate and strong heartbeats show up on the ultrasound monitor.

Family of Five Seeing three separate hearts beating on the ultrasound monitor completely shocked the birth mother and Sarah and Andy. The Justices struggled to get one baby, so three babies seemed like a fantasy. There was no chance Andy and Sarah were going to back out now. They knew those three babies were meant to be their children, so they decided to move forward with the adoption process. Sarah and Andy were ready to become the parents they had always dreamed of being.

Not Prepared

Despite the fact that the Justices had been trying for years to have kids, they were not prepared to have so many at one time. Getting pregnant with triplets naturally is pretty rare. Just as Sarah and Andy always do, they saw the best of a challenging situation. They had wanted to have more than one child eventually, so instead of having to go through the adoption process multiple times to have kids, they were able to get the family they wanted in one go. Despite the fact that the Justices had been trying for years to have kids, they were not prepared to have so many at one time. Getting pregnant with triplets naturally is pretty rare. Just as Sarah and Andy always do, they saw the best of a challenging situation. They had wanted to have more than one child eventually, so instead of having to go through the adoption process multiple times to have kids, they were able to get the family they wanted in one go.

Baby Proofing Sarah and Andy got to work immediately. They could not wait to meet their new babies and they wanted their home to be ready for when they arrived! The Justices started buying cribs and strollers. They purchased all of the major baby necessities and baby proofing their whole house. Their dream of becoming parents had been a long time coming. Now, Sarah and Andy could finally be the parents they dreamed of and they could not have been more excited!

Party of Five It was May 2013 and the time finally arrived for Andy and Sarah to meet their new babies! The birth mother’s water broke and she went into labor eight weeks early. Andy and Sarah met the birth mom at the hospital and waited patiently for hours anticipating the arrival of their new babies. Finally, after a long and hard labor, the birth mother delivered three tiny three-pound babies. The newborn triplets, Hannah, Joel, and Elizabeth were ready to meet their new parents.

Premature Newborns The fact that Hannah, Joel, and Elizabeth were born eight weeks early was a little bit alarming for new parents, Sarah and Andy. Because they were born prematurely, the triplets had to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for some time before they were allowed to be taken home. While in the hospital, the newborn babies developed more and more. Each day the triplets grew stronger until they could finally leave the hospital and go home with their new parents.

One Week Later Just one week after the triplets were born, Sarah began to feel sick. The adoption process and birth of the triplets had been very stressful on the Justices, so Sarah decided to visit her doctor to check on her health. The new mom wanted to make sure she was healthy enough for the triplets to come home. The doctor thoroughly examined Sarah and tested her for various illnesses. After some time, the doctor returned after he found out why Sarah wasn’t feeling well!

Sarah’s Pregnant When the doctor returned to the waiting room, he let Sarah know that she was not sick at all. After the doctor ran a series of tests, he discovered that Sarah was actually pregnant! The good news was almost too shocking to believe. Understandably, Sarah was completely surprised by the miracle of her pregnancy. After many years of trying to conceive, she was finally pregnant one week after she adopted triplets! Still, there was one more huge surprise though…

Twins The doctor told Sarah that she was pregnant with another set of multiples! The new mom of triplets was now pregnant naturally with twins after years of thinking she was barren! If anyone else was in the same situation as Andy and Sarah, they probably would feel that this new pregnancy came at the worst time. As we know by now, Sarah and Andy aren’t like anyone else. They take each challenge they are faced with and find the positive in it.

Blessings The Justices saw the humor in the situation they were in could not have been happier! Still, they couldn’t believe they were having five babies all under the age of one! Even though the new parents were overwhelmed by the news of multiple multiples, they were still so excited to grow their family even more. Sarah and Andy took a tough situation and moved forward with it. The Justices saw the new pregnancy as a blessing. They could not wait to meet their biological twins.

Family of Seven A few more months passed, and just as the Justices were getting used to life with the triplets, Sarah went into labor. The twins were on their way into the world and ready to join this new and growing family. Finally, after a long labor, Sarah delivered her new twins, Andrew and Abigail. Everything went well and Sarah and Andy were ecstatic and ready to adjust to life with five babies. Life with five new babies was a huge change!

How To Feed A Large Family Fortunately, with the help of the community, family, and friends, Sarah and Andy got all the support they needed. As the Justices adjusted to life without much sleep, members of Tulsa’s Eastland Baptist Church came to Sarah and Andy’s rescue in the nick of time. The church members were ready to chip in and help by donating food to the new family of seven. Community members cooked meals for the Justices and even sent them baby formula.

Community Help Some friends even offered to help babysit while the couple was at work. Friends and church members were not the only people to offer their times and money. Donations poured in from all over the state. Total strangers pitched in by sending diapers, bottles, blankets, and clothes. Sarah and Andy were so grateful because they really needed the help and the extra diapers. The new family of seven was going through more than 300 diapers and 84 bottles a week!

Huge Changes The new family of seven grew so much that they needed to rearrange many things. Their schedules completely shifted, and they had to buy a bigger van. They also had to learn how to tell all of their babies apart. Sarah and Andy decided to paint their babies’ toenails with different nail polish colors to remember which baby was which. The nail polish system made it much easier for Sarah and Andy to distinguish each child and figure out feeding and changing schedules.

They Went Viral It did not take long for the Justice’s remarkable story to hit the internet and go viral. Once the family’s phenomenal story spread, the Justices became internet sensations. Everyone wanted to know about the family of seven. At first, the Justice’s story garnered attention from Facebook and they gained tons of followers. Soon after, people all over the world were interested in seeing the family’s photos and updates. Then, shortly after the story went viral, the family discovered one more huge surprise!

Family of Eight Though it may be hard to believe, Sarah found out she was pregnant again! The Justice’s welcomed their sixth baby in 2016! Even though the Justices already had their hands full with six children, they both agreed that they wouldn’t have it any other way. Sarah and Andy Justice love being parents more than anything and they couldn’t wait to add another baby to their family. Sarah told the Today show, “It was something we’ve wanted so badly that we love it. We just really love having these children.”

What’s One More If you already have five children in one year, adding one more in two years is a piece of cake. The Justices are used to having their hands full at all times, so adding another baby into an already full household was not too overwhelming. In some ways, having their sixth baby was easier because it was Sarah and Andy’s first non-multiple child! On the other hand, six young kids at the same time definitely pose some unique challenges.

Baby #6 It is no surprise that having eight people under one roof can get pretty hectic. Just remembering each child’s name can get a little confusing. The oldest triplets are Joel, Hannah, and Elizabeth. The twins, Abigail and Andrew arrived a couple months after the trio. Most recently, baby number six joined the squad. Despite the family’s challenges, they are a pretty happy bunch. Just take a peek at how adorable all of the kids look celebrating the fourth of July!

Potty Training So, who is the newest member of the Justice family? A precious baby boy named Caleb joined the Justice clan in 2016. Around the time he was born, the triplets turned four years old and the twins turned three and a half years old. For the family of eight, home has become a place that is loud and busy, to say the least. Luckily for Sarah and Andy, most of their children are out of diapers and in the process of potty trained.

Dream Come True In an interview with Babyology, Sarah Justice opened up and got candid about life with six kids under the age of five. She shared, “Having a number of children is a dream come true. When you wait for something you appreciate it that much more when you get it.” After years of trying to have kids, the mother of six was so grateful for her opportunity to be a mom that she doesn’t even mind being so busy.

Toddler Beds Since the Justices have expanded their family, many aspects of their lives have changed. Right now, the family has been shifting the way they sleep. The mother of the multiples also shared that all five toddlers are in the process of transitioning into toddler beds. She admitted, “Having five in toddler beds is an adventure. But we are getting there.” Moving five kids that are three to four-year-olds from cribs to beds is a huge feat. Clearly, Sarah and Andy have an immense amount of patience.

Crazy Schedules So, we are sure you were wondering how the Justices keep up with so many young children at one time. They do it all by having an extremely organized schedule. Organized plans are crucial when you have a big family. The family of eight starts their day off with a morning walk. After the stroll, typically the toddlers have playdate plans with friends and relatives. Then the playdates are often followed by family household chores that are done all together.

Bathroom Time Anyone with just one growing toddler knows that potty training can take over a parent’s life. Now multiply that by five! A huge part of the family’s day is devoted to bathroom breaks. Sarah got candid with Babyology about the struggle with bathroom time. She shared, “Potty breaks are a big part of our day when you have five children at the same life stage.” Luckily, the Justices will get through that milestone soon and move on to other cleaner activities.

Never Alone It is pretty incredible that the Justice children will never be left out without anyone to be with. At school, these kids will not ever have to worry about not having someone to sit with at lunch or not having a friend to play with. The mom of six shared, “We never lack playmates and work to promote love and care between the siblings. Our children will always have a friend and will never need to feel lonely.”

Come a Long Way Over the years, the Justice family has grown and changed a lot. Sarah and Andy have come a long way from having to use 84 bottles and 300 diapers a week. Now, when Sarah and Andy feed baby Caleb, they only need one bottle at a time. According to the parents of six, all of the other kids “absolutely adore their baby Caleb.” The toddlers love playing with their new baby brothers and showering him with hugs and kisses.","A Couple Adopted Triplets, One Week Later Doctor Reveals Unexpected News"

The Tasmanian giant crab, Pseudocarcinus gigas (sometimes known as the giant deepwater crab, giant southern crab or queen crab) is a very large species of crab that resides on rocky and muddy bottoms in the oceans off Southern Australia.[2][3] It is the only species in the genus Pseudocarcinus.[4]

Habitat [ edit ]

The Tasmanian giant crab lives on rocky and muddy bottoms in the oceans off Southern Australia on the edge of the continental shelf at depths of 20–820 metres (66–2,690 ft).[2][3] It is most abundant at 110–180 metres (360–590 ft) in the summer and 190–400 metres (620–1,310 ft) in the winter.[3] The seasonal movements generally follow temperature as it prefers 12–14 °C (54–57 °F).[3] The full temperature range where the species can be seen appears to be 10–18 °C (50–64 °F).[5]

Description [ edit ]

The Tasmanian giant crab is one of the largest crabs in the world, reaching a mass of 17.6 kg (39 lb) and a carapace width of up to 46 cm (18 in).[6] Among crabs only the Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi) can weigh more.[5] Male Tasmanian giant crabs reach more than twice the size of females,[7] which do not exceed 7 kg (15 lb).[6] Males have one normal-sized and one oversized claw (which can be longer than the carapace width[5]), while both claws are normal-sized in the females.[6] This crab is mainly whitish-yellow below and red above; the tips of the claws are black.[8] Small individuals are yellowish-and-red spotted above.[5]

Behaviour [ edit ]

The Tasmanian giant crab feeds on carrion and slow-moving species, including gastropods, crustaceans (anomura and brachyura) and starfish.[3][7] Cannibalism also occurs.[3] They breed in June and July, and the female carries the 0.5–2 million eggs for about four months.[7] After hatching, the planktonic larvae float with the current for about two months before settling on the bottom.[5] The species is long-lived and slow-growing; juveniles moult their carapace every three-four years and adult females about once every nine years.[5][6] This greatly limits the breeding frequency, as mating is only possible in the period immediately after the old carapace has been shed, and the new is still soft.[6]

Fishery [ edit ]

The Tasmanian giant crab has been commercially fished in Tasmanian waters since 1992 and a minimum size was established in Australia in 1993.[7] Fishing is typically by pots in water deeper than 140 m (460 ft).[6] Following concerns surrounding the sustainability of catch numbers, the total allowable catch was adjusted in 2004 to 62.1 tonnes (137,000 lb).[9] Twenty-five operators competed for the catch in 2005, delivering a total catch valued at about A$2 million.[9] The Tasmanian giant crab is very long-lived and slow-growing, making it vulnerable to overfishing.[7] Before export, they are sometimes kept alive in tanks with water that is 10–14 °C (50–57 °F).[3]

"She was saying a real goodbye to Steve Carell for leaving the show, with real tears. ",https://mashable.com/article/jenna-fischer-the-office-steve-carell-goodbye,"It's been nearly five years since The Office ended, but Jenna Fischer is still answering questions about her role as Pam Beesly.

In an Instagram live video on Tuesday, Fischer answered one of the lingering questions fans still have to this day: What did Pam say to Michael in Season 7's touching episode, ""Goodbye, Michael?""

In Steve Carell's farewell episode, Michael says goodbye to everyone in the office except Pam, who was busy running an errand.

Pam was MIA because she thought Michael wasn't leaving until the next day, but once Jim found out Michael was catching a flight to Colorado to live with his fiancé later that night he brought Pam to the airport to make sure the two got to part ways properly.

Pam and Michael meet up and exchange words, but no one could hear what was said because neither of them were wearing their mics (it was supposed to be a documentary, remember?).

""That was me talking to Steve. I told him all the ways I was going to miss him when he left our show. Those were real tears and a real goodbye,"" Fischer told her Instagram followers. ""That was a really emotional scene.""

Fischer was also asked to reveal her favorite episode, a question to which she had a very thorough answer.

""I just watched 'Branch Wars' from Season 4 and I was kind of loving it,"" she said. ""But my ultimate favorite is 'Dinner Party.'""

How great is it to know that the entire cast is just as obsessed with that episode as fans are?

Fisher went on to give the ""Health Care"" episode in Season 1 a shoutout, along with the episodes after Pam gave birth. The actress revealed she loves when Pam nurses the wrong baby in ""The Delivery,"" sharing that her IRL husband was in the episode.

After four long days of waiting, royal fans finally learned that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge named their newborn prince Louis Arthur Charles. Even though the name Louis goes back generations in the royal family — Prince Phillip's uncle was Lord Louis Mountbatten and it's also one of Prince William and Prince George's middle names —there's still a lot of debate over how to pronounce the royal baby's name.

So what is it? While the name Louis can be pronounced either loo-ee or loo-is, there is a right way to pronounce the royal baby's new name.

The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge. pic.twitter.com/4DUwsLv5JQ — The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (@KensingtonRoyal) April 27, 2018

Since the name Louis is originally a French name that means ""renowned warrior,"" the royal family — as well as pretty much everyone else in the UK — pronounce the name the French way.

So, the right way to say the royal baby's name is loo-ee.

Not only do Prince William and Prince George both pronounce their middles names this way, but also it's the way that all 18 of the French kings named Louis pronounced their names, too. Other famous Louis that pronounce their name the same way include the musician Louis Armstrong, fashion designer Louis Vuitton and One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson.

Scammers will pose as your phone company and get your personal information. ,https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/news-alerts/missed-delivery-call-or-voicemail-flubot-scams,"Since August 2021, many Australians have been getting scam text messages about missed calls, voicemails or deliveries. We’ve received over 16,000 reports of these scams. These scams have also already been a problem overseas in 2021.

The text messages ask you to tap on a link to download or access something. There are a large number of variants of the Flubot text messages, but often they ask you to download an app to track or organise a time for a delivery, hear a voicemail message, or view photos that have been uploaded. However, the message is fake, there is no delivery, voicemail, or photos uploaded and the app is actually malicious software called Flubot.

Android phones and iPhones can both receive texts from the Flubot.

If you receive one of these messages, do not click or tap on the link. Delete the message immediately.

What the scam messages look like

Scammers are frequently updating the Flubot text message format. We’ll update this page regularly, but we recommend that you check the @Scamwatch_gov Twitter account for the most up to date warnings about these messages.

Flubot text messages change regularly

Flubot scammers are regularly updating the text messages they send out to try and infect your device with Flubot. Recently, we’ve received reports of messages relating to Zoom invites, Google verifications and ‘thank you’ messages from clinics, as well as the major categories set out below.

Flubot text messages include a link which almost always contains a series of 5-9 random letters and numbers at the end of the link

As a general rule, if you receive a text message that contains a link, do not click on the link.

Photo uploads

Starting in October 2021, some Flubot messages now say that your photos have been uploaded. They provide a link to where the ‘album’ has been uploaded.

The typical wording of these messages is:

Someone uploaded your | pictures. A whole album is uploaded - | here: https://consult.priyalco.com/h/?cftlkv"">https://consult.priyalco.com/h/?cftlkv y6j

Example: An SMS that says someone has uploaded your photos

We strongly recommend that you never click on the links in these messages. However, if you do accidentally click on this link, we note that this will take you to a page which claims your device is already infected with Flubot and tells you that you need to install a security update to remove Flubot.

This is a clever trick by scammers; your phone is not infected, but installing the security update will infect your phone as it downloads the Flubot malware.

Delivery notifications

Starting in September 2021, many Flubot messages now talk about a delivery. They usually refer to DHL and always ask you to take some form of action in relation to the 'delivery'. We have also started to see reports referring to Amazon deliveries.

Messages can include:

scheduling a delivery time

tracking a delivery

managing a delivery that is 'in transit' or will be 'delivered soon'

telling you it's your last chance to arrange pick up/delivery of a parcel

asking you to enter your details to receive a package

getting 'more information' about your delivery.

Unlike earlier Flubot messages (which are also still circulating), the new text messages may not contain spelling mistakes, so they can be harder to spot. However, they do contain a website link followed by 5-9 random letters and numbers. Here are some examples:

The delivery time for your parcel is 03/09. Check out your options: http://example.com/g.php?l2r54ya alfal

Voicemail and missed call notifications (August 2021)

Missed call and voicemail messages started circulating in Australia in August 2021. They often begin with 5-9 random lowercase letters or numbers, then say you had a missed call or voicemail message.

The text message often includes several misspellings. Here are some examples.

ab12c3 Nfw voice yessage received

gh6tr7 Voicemail message receiied

x78y9z New oozce-message received

After saying you have a missed call, voicemail or message, the messages include a link. The message may also say the voicemail message will be automatically deleted if you don’t access it.



Example: Android's spam/blocked folder with several scam messages

Example: A scam message saying that a voicemail message was received.

Example: A fake voice message notification on an iPhone

Example: A text message saying that the recipient missed a call.

Example: An iPhone notification showing a scam message about a missed call.

What happens if you click or tap the link

Clicking/tapping the link could lead to downloading malware (malicious software) to your phone.

Here's what each type of scam looks like.

For photo upload texts

You'll see a screen with:

a warning that your device has been infected with Flubot

a button or link that asks you to 'install security update'

The page sometimes says that a window may appear preventing the installation and that you should enable the instillation via your devices settings.

For delivery texts

You'll see a screen with:

stolen DHL / courier branding

a button or link asking you to download an app to track your delivery's progress

The page sometimes says your phone may flag the app as suspicious and that you should ignore this warning.

For voicemail/missed call texts

You'll see a screen with:

your phone number

a note saying how long the fake message is (such as 2 minutes and 34 seconds)

a link to 'Download voicemail app' and instructions to enable the download of the application if this was blocked initially by your phone.

If you have an Android device

If you have an Android device, it will download an application called Voicemail71.apk, Update42.apk’ or DHL34.apk. This application is malware.

You would then be asked to install the application.

The landing page that fraudulently states your device is infected with Flubot can look like this:

The landing page that asks you to download the fake DHL application can look like this:

The application may be able to:

read your text messages

send text messages from your phone

make phone calls from your number

access your contacts

Installing the software is likely to give scammers access to your passwords and accounts. They may be able to use this information to steal your money or personal information.

It will also ask other infected Australian phones to send Flubot messages to the numbers it steals from your phone, continuing and expanding the scam.

If you have an iPhone

If you have an iPhone, you may see a link to download software. This software isn’t the same as Flubot, but it can still damage your device.

What to do if you’ve downloaded the Flubot

Act immediately. If you have already clicked the link to download the application, your passwords and online accounts are now at risk from hackers.

Don't enter any passwords or log into any accounts until you have followed the below steps. If you need to check your online banking, use a different device to do so.

Clean your device

Cleaning your device using the steps below will remove the malicious software from your device.

To clean your device, you can:

contact an IT professional

download official Android anti-virus software through the Google Play Store

perform a factory reset of the device, as soon as possible.

The best way to make sure that your phone is clean is to use the 'Erase all Content and Settings' or 'Factory reset' features. The exact name of the feature will depend on the device you have. Performing this reset of your device will delete all of your data including photos, messages, and authentication applications.

When performing a factory reset it's important that you don't restore from any backups created after you downloaded the app, as they will be infected.

Change your passwords and secure your information

If you have logged in to any accounts or apps using a password since downloading the app, you need to change your passwords.

If you have used the same passwords for any other accounts, you also need to change those passwords.

Contact your bank and ensure your accounts are secure.

How to protect yourself

Do not click on links in text messages that contain a link with a series of random numbers and letters.

Do not call back the individual who sent the text. It’s unlikely that they are a scammer or criminal. Scammers can disguise their caller ID as legitimate numbers to carry out these scams. This is also known as spoofing.

Delete the message immediately.

They're strawberry flavored. ,https://www.elitedaily.com/news/outrageous-truth-green-gummy-bears-will-destroy-world/1203031,"Sorry, everyone: Your entire life has been a lie.

Hear me out.

Imagine you've been hit with a sudden craving for candy. You go to the store, fork over a dollar (or, if you live in New York, your life savings) for a bag of gummy bears. Because you're a classy one, you go for the classic Haribo Gold-Bears gummies: the good kind.

As you're eating, you relish in the sugary, fruity flavors of the miniature bears, switching colors as you go: Yellow for lemon, red for raspberry, green for… wait, what is that flavor?

You've been conditioned to associate that toxic waste-like shade of green with green apple or lime. Watermelon, even, if we're getting fancy.

But Haribo's green gummy bears are none of these flavors. Haribo's green gummy is, perplexingly, strawberry flavored. A writer for Metro's UK site made this baffling discovery today, and dutifully shared her findings with the rest of the English-speaking world via a short post on the site; she, too, felt betrayed by the secret life of the Green Gummy.

If you're feeling confused, outraged, lost — just know that you're not alone.

I suggest that you go to the grocery store and stock up on as much green apple, lime (and maybe even watermelon) candy you can get your hands on, and stuff your face until it hurts.

Candy-replacement therapy may not heal your wounds — that's time's job — but it will certainly help.

Yes. ,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/animals-dogs-therapy-health-pets,"If you're a dog lover, just being with your pet feels good.

So it's no surprise that therapy dogs are healing companions for people with health conditions such as cancer, post-traumatic stress syndrome, and dementia.

There are over 50,000 therapy dogs in the United States, and they're becoming more popular in countries from Norway to Brazil. Trained and certified by a variety of organizations, these dogs and their handlers go into hospitals and other facilities and interact with patients.

Research confirms that the benefits of pet therapy are real—but what do dogs think about helping humans? Science has considered this question too, and the results are reassuring. (Read why pets are so good for us.)

A recent study in Applied Animal Behaviour Science reports that therapy dogs in pediatric cancer wards are not stressed by their ""work,"" and in fact seem to enjoy it in most cases.

""What made this study unique was that it was multisite—it took place in five different hospitals across the country—and the fact that we visited over a hundred patients and 26 dogs participated, making it the largest of its kind in this field,"" says study leader Amy McCullough, national director of research and therapy at American Humane, a Washington, D.C.-based animal welfare organization.

Working Like a Dog

The researchers measured levels of cortisol, a hormone elevated in response to stress, in the canines' saliva. The swabs were taken both at home and during therapy sessions at the hospital.

However, cortisol level rise with both good and bad stress. ""Let's say we have a dog that loves to play ball—when the ball comes out and the dog starts chasing the ball, that would elevate the dog's cortisol levels as well,"" McCullough says.

So the team also videotaped and analyzed 26 canine behaviors in three categories: friendly actions such as approaching a person or play-bowing; moderate stress indicators such as lip-licking and shaking; and high-stress behaviors like whimpering. (Read more about why dogs are so friendly.)

1:03

The scientists found no difference between the study dogs' cortisol levels at home and at the hospital, evidence that the therapy dogs were not particularly stressed.

Making Work Fun

The finding is consistent with previous research, according to Lisa Maria Glenk, author of a 2017 review of the literature on therapy dog welfare.

The ""well-designed"" study is particularly valuable for its level of detail: ""Previous studies provided only limited or no information on session activities, which makes it hard to identify the practices that raise stress levels in dogs,"" says Glenk, of Vienna's University of Veterinary Medicine.

The next question is whether therapy dogs actually enjoy their work, she says—and the new pediatric cancer study provides a few hints. (Your dog knows how you feel—here's how.)

For example, dogs seemed happier during some activities than others; a child talking to the dog or playing with its toy, for example, seemed to elicit more friendly responses than a child brushing the animal or drawing it.

Looking at the results, ""it's fair to say that some activities are more fun for the dog,"" McCullough notes.

""This is good information for handlers—they can lean toward the activities that they think their dog would enjoy.""

Finding a Natural Fit

That requires observing therapy dogs closely, even if they can seem inconsistent at times. For instance, the study found that the dogs who showed the most stress behaviors also showed the most friendly behaviors, suggesting that some canines may just be more obvious about their feelings. (See some of our favorite dog pictures.)

Like with any job, it's important to choose the right candidates, McCullough adds. Many people want to share their pets' affection with their local communities, ""but that doesn't mean their dog is cut out for this kind of work.""

So therapy dog trainers and certifiers, as well as owners, need to look for enthusiasm, not mere tolerance.

""Does the dog solicit attention, or does the dog need to be bribed with treats to interact?"" she says.

""It needs to be a mutually beneficial interaction when they are visiting with the client, so it's important that the dog really loves their job.""",Therapy Dogs Work Miracles. But Do They Like Their Jobs?

The bully smiled at him. ,https://www.unilad.co.uk/viral/dad-branded-bully-after-forcing-son-to-hold-i-am-a-bully-sign-as-punishment,"@usert0c8co0flo/TikTok

A father in Florida has been branded a ‘bully’ himself after he apparently forced his son to stand at the side of the road holding a sign reading ‘I am a bully’.

It goes without saying that bullying should never be tolerated and that parents should do what they can to nip it in the bud if they learn their child is mistreating others, but the way this particular set of parents chose to handle the situation has prompted mixed reviews from other members of the public.

Advert 10

The scene was shared online by TikToker Gavin Klein after apparently being filmed in Florida, where a young boy could be seen holding the telling sign above his head while two people who appear to be his parents sat in deck chairs watching over him.

Check it out below:

Advert 10

The person behind the camera could be heard describing the scene as ‘so mean’, before saying they wanted to ‘yell at the parents’ for making the child hold the sign which read: ‘I am a bully. Honk if you hate bullies.’

Of course, with very little context surrounding the video, it’s hard to know exactly what led to the boy being placed at the side of the road, but still, social media users have blasted the parents for ‘publicly humiliating’ their son.

Klein described the dad as a ‘bully’ as he posted the video, while another responded to say that ‘publicly embarrassing your child isnt [sic] the way to fix the problem.’

A third responded: ‘discipline is okay. Public discipline is not going to teach them anything.’

@userkvwohn43eu/TikTok

Other TikTokers, however, have positioned themselves on the parents’ side, arguing that ‘If you disagree with this as a form of punishment, you’re soft.’

One comment reads: ‘That’s parenting [clap emoji]. Discipline, embarrassment to make them never do it again. That def [sic] ain’t mean.’

At the time of writing, December 24, the clip of the young boy has racked up more than five million views.

One. ,https://www.popsugar.com/family/How-Many-Nannies-Does-Kate-Middleton-Have-44772269,"Kate Middleton is officially a mom of three! The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William welcomed their third child, a baby boy named Louis, on April 23, and the world is officially in royal baby frenzy (that is, until Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot). While most people are celebrating the newest member of the royal family, public figures as well-known as Kate aren't strangers to having a few haters.

Who cares if she doesn't have a ""regular"" job? By having a nanny, she's helping herself be a better mother.

While Kate doesn't have a traditional 9-to-5 job that keeps her away from her kids most days, she is extremely busy. In addition to working with numerous charities, including her Heads Together initiative with William and Harry, Kate makes official appearances at locations all around England to raise awareness for issues affecting its people. She also goes on royal tours with her family, attends official dinners and galas, and, most importantly, is mom to her kids, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. And since starting their family in 2013, Kate and Will have used the care of a nanny, Maria Teresa. Naturally, plenty of people feel the need to judge their decision to have extra help when they already live at Kensington Palace, which has a full staff. My response? Leave her alone.

People can raise their children how they want to and that includes royals. Gone are the days from the 1950s when almost every suburban family chose to raise their children in the same cookie-cutter way. No mother should ever shame another mother for how they choose to raise their kids, or for having a little extra help with the everyday grind. Kate is simply giving her children a little extra love from another human being, and I don't see anything wrong with that. Those children are lucky enough to be born into royalty, but they're extra blessed that they have another person or two in their home keeping them safe, teaching them lessons, and making them feel special.

If I could afford a nanny to come into my home and play with my kids while I worked out or showered alone, then hell yes, I'd do it. Why not? Mothers, even duchesses, deserve some alone time, too. Who cares if she doesn't have a ""regular"" job? By having a nanny, she's helping herself be a better mother by simply giving herself a break. And motherhood can be lonely at times, too. Maybe she and her nanny have formed a little camaraderie. I bet having a nanny by her side helps her from going insane due to all of the mundane activities and messes that come with being a mother. We see Kate all dressed up and looking gorgeous in public, but she probably has messy hair and sweatpants days, too (man, I'd love to see that).

And Kate is usually always with her kids whenever she can be. She and Will have been praised in the past for paving the way to a more modern monarchy, and that includes putting family ahead of their royal duties. They bring their children on royal tours, are open and honest about how they raise them, put them in traditional schools with other children, and yes, have play dates in the park with a nanny. Kate is a hands-on mother who's utilizing her resources. Let's not shame her for that but instead applaud her for doing a damn good job. She may be part of the royal family, but she's a mother, just like us, so we all have the same title and are doing our best at the hardest job in the world.

"""Not close"" - Tom Cruise ",https://uproxx.com/hitfix/tom-cruise-marvel-iron-man/,"As Avengers: Infinity War hits theaters, one fun exercise is to ponder what Marvel’s colossal MCU enveloping blockbuster would be like if the MCU’s first star was someone radically different. Legend had it that Tom Cruise and his jumbo-sized smile came close to going underneath Tony Stark’s armor in Iron Mano. In a new interview, Cruise clarified how near we came.

Chatting with ComicBook.com as part of Mission: Impossible — Fallout promo, Cruise shared that he wasn’t as close to playing Iron Man as Marvel lore would suggest. Not that he had an unkind word for the person who did take on the role.

“Not close,” Cruise explained. “Not close, and I love Robert Downey Jr. I can’t imagine anyone else in that role, and I think it’s perfect for him.”

As for a superhero role that might be perfect for Cruise, the stunt enthusiast said that he’s not opposed to doing the comic book thing if the project’s right.

“I don’t rule anything out,” he said. “It’s, ‘What’s the story? Does it interest me? Do I feel this is where the audience would like to see me in? What can I learn?’ And ‘What can I contribute?’ That’s how I choose my movies.”

Prince Louis Arthur Charles. ,https://time.com/5254883/royal-baby-name-reactions/,"Following nearly three days of rampant speculation, Prince William and Kate Middleton have finally revealed the name of the third royal baby: Prince Louis Arthur Charles.

The highly-anticipated announcement of the new royal baby name was made via Kensington Palace’s official Twitter account on Thursday, prompting an outpouring of emotion from royals fans around the world. As the odds on Louis had previously been 33/1, many expressed surprised at the choice.

Some were quick to comment on the historical significance behind the name, while others opted to share strong opinions.

After arriving at St. Mary’s Hospital in London on Monday, Kate Middleton gave birth to her third child with Prince William at 6 a.m. EST. The couple then introduced Prince Louis to the world outside the hospital’s private Lindo Wing just as they did with their first two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte.

"""Hey...do I know you from somewhere?"" ",https://lifehacker.com/how-to-greet-someone-if-youre-not-sure-if-you-know-them-1796917511,"Some of us just aren’t great at remembering faces, which can result in an awkward moment when we think we’re meeting someone for the first time and they say we’ve met before. Or even worse, we think we’ve met someone before and greet them that way, only to find out they have no idea who we are. Here’s a one sentence trick to avoiding these embarrassing moments.

On NPR’s Hidden Brain podcast, they share a simple way to find out if the person you’re greeting is a stranger or someone you should know. Aim to say this in a light or neutral tone so it comes off as natural. As you shake their hand or give a quick wave, say, “Hey, do I know you from somewhere...?”

If they say no, play it off with, “Oh, you just looked a little familiar. Wonderful to meet you!”

If they say yes and mention how you know each other, follow up with, “Yes, that’s right. So good to see you again!” Of course, this only works one or two times with the same person, so if you have a strong feeling you’ve met them before (and maybe used this trick), go for something more general like, “Hey, how are you?”

As with any type of warm greeting, the key to making this work is to send signals that you’re pleased to meet this new person (or see them again if it turns out you know each other). Give a genuine smile, use a light inflection when greeting them, and be an active listener.",How to Greet Someone If You're Not Sure If You Know Them
Mutes automatically played videos. ,https://mashable.com/article/google-chrome-66-mutes-autoplay-video,"Google just gave us a very long overdue gift: the ability to browse in silence.

That's because Google Chrome will finally mute annoying autoplaying videos by default. The update, part of Google Chrome 66, launched today for the browser's desktop and mobile apps.

With the update, you'll no longer have to manually mute sites that autoplay videos with sound. Instead, Chrome will block the videos from playing altogether (note that videos set to autoplay without sound will still play).

The only exception will be sites where you've ""previously shown an interest in media on the site."" So expect sites like YouTube, where you've likely engaged with a lot of video in the past, to still play as they normally would. (Gizmodo also has a good breakdown on how Google determines what sites you're ""interested"" in.)

This also applies to mobile browsing (unless you have a website saved to your home screen), which is nice because it can be much more difficult to spot and manually mute the offending site in a mobile browser.

Garlic bread is one of the most delicious snacks around, but what happens to the taste when it’s been sent to the edge of space?

YouTuber Tom Scott sent half a loaf of garlic bread to the edge of space, then taste-tested it against bread that had stayed on Earth.

The video sees the bread float 35km up to the stratosphere – the second major layer of Earth’s atmosphere – on a weather balloon. The bread is then sent back down and tasted by a group.

The amazing video has over 973,000 views and shows Scott with a group, including maker of the bread Barry Lewis, and Steve Randall from Random Aerospace, launching the snack into the stratosphere.

The group tracked the balloon with a GPS to find the garlic bread’s predicted landing spot.

Scott said it’s rare that space-sent food actually gets eaten, and when the group tested the bread, they found it had an icy middle due to the stratosphere’s freezing temperatures.

To keep your car smelling fresh, open a box of dryer sheets and set it under a seat. If the scent is too strong, use one sheet at a time and change as needed. Dryer sheets are less expensive than air fresheners, and often smell much better.

If dampness is a problem in your car, fill a sock half-full with kitty litter crystals. Place the sock on your dash or on the floor -- the crystals will absorb the moisture.

Tight fit in your garage? Protect your car and your home by providing yourself a guidance system and cushioning. Attach a tennis ball to a string and suspend it from the garage's roof; it should be positioned so that, when the car is parked perfectly, the ball will rest on your windshield at the rearview mirror. For protective cushioning, split a pool noodle in half longways and attach to the garage wall -- the car doors should smash harmlessly against the noodle instead of the wall.

They don't eat bulk items fast enough before they spoil. ,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/costco-deals-produce-2018-4,"Costco deals are all over the places. They can range from cheap, tasty meals at the food court to the rewards that come with the chain’s executive membership

And many of Costco’s deals are fan favourites with customers and employees.

But when Business Insider recently asked 46 Costco employees from around the country to share what items they wouldn’t buy at the store, several of them said they didn’t buy produce at the store.

And the reason wasn’t quality.

The issue was the chain’s penchant for bulk sizes.

“While our produce department is one of the best in the business, I personally don’t eat veggies fast enough to buy in bulk, so two thirds of it will spoil before I eat it,” a Minnesota-based Costco worker told Business Insider.

A Costco manager that’s worked all around the US said that buying produce was a “waste of money” for them, as they couldn’t “eat the huge quantity fast enough.”

Three additional employees from Utah, Idaho, and Hawaii agreed that they steered clear of buying produce from Costco for the same reason.

An employee from Florida added that Costco has to work hard to keep its fruits and vegetables fresh within the store, noting that quality control is hard but essential when dealing with such large quantities.",Costco employees explain why they don’t buy produce there

"He only got salad bowls and worked out regularly, so he stayed fit. Saved you 13 clicks. ",https://time.com/4417999/fit-guy-eats-chipotle-every-day/,"Devin Cunningham, 25, has great abs. But his secret might surprise you. He says his steady diet of Chipotle, which he’s been been eating every single day for a year straight, has helped him get in prime shape. In fact, he plans to keep eating Chipotle daily for an unspecified period of time.

“I just really like Chipotle,” he says.

The Washington state resident, who works in communications and marketing, wasn’t always this obsessed with the fast-casual burrito chain, but he had seen a story about a guy who ate Chipotle straight for 186 days — and knew he could do it even longer. After all, he was already eating there three to five times a week.

There was a surprising second reason to take on the 366-day Chipotle challenge: getting fit. Two years ago he discovered the “if it fits your macros” diet, which essentially prescribes the specific amounts of carbs, protein and fat you should consume in a day. Soon after, he doubled down on working out more effectively and learning to lift weights correctly. He decided that embarking on the year of eating Chipotle would actually be a good complement to his new fitness and diet habits.

Chipotle turned out to be a good place to experiment, as it’s “pretty spot-on with portions,” he says. At one point during the challenge, when he was being so stringent about what he ate that he even had the Chipotle servers package the components of his burrito bowls separately so he could weigh everything himself.

His biggest challenge came last fall, when all his local Chipotles shut down for two weeks because of an E. Coli scare. Luckily, Cunningham lives close to the border with Canada, so he was able to drive up north twice to pick up a necessary two-week supply of burritos from Vancouver, which he kept fresh by freezing them.

And about that E. Coli issue: “That didn’t worry me at all,” he says of the potential for contamination.

Beyond the Chipotle obsession, the rest of his diet is actually pretty normal: in the morning, it’s a blueberry bagel and protein shake or parfait with nonfat Greek yogurt. For lunch, he’ll hit up Chipotle; lately he’s been going for a chicken bowl with rice and cheese on the side. And in the evening, he’ll build a protein-rich meal around chicken or a turkey burger. He says he works out about six days a week, putting in 15 to 20 minutes of cardio a few days a week, with the rest of his workouts focused on weight lifting.

He has meticulously kept track of his progress and Chipotle purchases on Instagram, where his pics seem to support his claim that yes, it’s possible to get fit on a (partially) fast food diet.

The fast-casual chain took notice of his challenge, tweeting a special acknowledgement of his accomplishment.

And even after over a whole year of dedication to the challenge, he says he has no plans to let up.

“I want to inspire people to be fit,” Cunningham explains. “When people ask me advice on what foods to eat or what workouts to do, it makes me feel awesome and it makes me feel even better when I see them follow through with their goals.”

The takeaway? Even the burrito diet is real. Now we really have no excuses. (And maybe, if you’re as dedicated as Cunningham, you’ll even get a few free meals for your efforts.)

She's a fox. ,https://www.thedodo.com/in-the-wild/rescued-kitten-mistaken-identity,"Last week, Martine Vos was called out on a rescue mission she likely won't soon forget. Vos is a volunteer with Cat Shelter Limburg, a Belgium-based group that specializes in caring for homeless felines. So, naturally, when she received word about one such animal in need, she didn't hesitate to help. ""A man called our rescue number because he found a very little black kitten, only a few days old,"" Vos told The Dodo. ""He asked us to come and pick up this little baby."" Little did she or anyone know at the time, however, that things weren't exactly how they seemed.

Martine Vos

A search of the area where the little animal had been found turned up no signs of her mom, or any possible siblings, so Vos planned to take the orphan to a foster family who could care for her. It was around this time that Vos noticed that something was off about the supposed kitten. ""When I took the baby in my hands, she seemed really big and it felt totally different how a kitten should feel,"" Vos said. A closer inspection revealed that her face really wasn't so kitten-like either.

Her curiosity piqued, Vos and a colleague visited a veterinarian in hopes of confirming just what sort of animal this little baby actually was. But the vet was stumped, too. ""The one thing she was sure of is that it was a baby girl,"" Vos said. Next, Vos decided to consult a nearby wildlife rescue center — and with that, the mystery was solved. ""They recognized it as a baby fox,"" Vos said. Turns out, fox pups are often a darker shade very early on in life, and they do have a vaguely cat-like look.

Vos was thrilled to learn the rescued baby's true identity: ""Firstly, because I am really interested in the native wild animals,"" she said. ""And because of my surname 'Vos', which means 'fox' in Dutch. It was my dream to meet a fox in real life. So holding this little baby fox in my hands and preventing it from a certain death was a dream that came true!"" The baby fox has since been placed with wildlife experts to be raised until she's old enough to return to the wild.

Caring for his family. ,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/conor-mcgregor-makes-first-instagram-statement-since-bus-attack-2018-4,"Conor McGregor just said he has the best job in the world – and he isn’t talking about fighting.

The Irish UFC star was arrested last week for an alleged attack on a UFC team bus.

However, his latest statement on Instagram indicates that life is still good.

He said he has the “best job in the world” looking after his family.

Frequent Instagrammer Conor McGregor has made his first statement on the platform since getting arrested last week – and it’s to say he has the best job in the world.

However, the UFC fighter, a former two-weight world champion, was not talking about life in an octagon, but life as a family man.

McGregor, 29, has been a full-time professional mixed martial artist since 2008. In those 10 years he has won featherweight and lightweight titles in Cage Warriors, featherweight and lightweight titles in UFC, and has become the biggest pay-per-view attraction in the whole of MMA.

By his side with every step of his ascent to the top of the combat sports mountain has been Dee Devlin, his partner of 10 years. The Irish couple had their first child, Jack McGregor Jr, on May 5 2017 – just a few months before McGregor’s landmark boxing rules bout against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas.

McGregor regularly posts family photos on his official Instagram account. And, despite the global fallout from his well publicised arrest earlier this month, that trend continued on Thursday.

“I have the best job in the world looking after my family,” he said. “If we all look after our own, we are all looked after.”

McGregor is yet to make a comment since he was recorded on video attacking a UFC bus, throwing a guard rail, and starting a confrontation that led to two athletes requiring hospital treatment.

He turned himself in to police last week, was charged with three counts of assault and one of criminal mischief, but reportedly told his boss – UFC president Dana White – that the alleged attack “had to be done.”

McGregor was released on a $US50,000 bail after appearing in a New York City court on Friday. He was granted permission to travel outside the United States but has another court appearance on June 14.",Conor McGregor said he has the best job in the world — and he isn’t talking about fighting
It was a large raccoon. ,https://abcnews.go.com/US/called-911-report-tiger-york-city-wasnt/story?id=54422500,"A New Yorker’s daily exposure to the animal kingdom consists of mainly pigeons and rats, so perhaps a mistake like Thursday’s can be forgiven.

It was just before 8 a.m. when police said several callers to 911 reported spotting a tiger in the street near West 162 Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in the Washington Heights neighborhood.

The NYPD’s Emergency Service Unit was called but the animal that police safely caught turned out to be a large raccoon.

Animal Care Centers of New York City took custody of the raccoon from the NYPD and put it down. The law requires it.

“The raccoon was brought into our facility and was euthanized as required by law for all vector species animals brought into the shelter,” ACC said in a statement. “Raccoons, bats and skunks are classified as a rabies vector species, which means it's an animal that can carry and transmit rabies.”

Use multiple 100 ml bottles and put them in a clear plastic bag. ,https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-bring-and-drink-your-own-booze-on-a-flight-2018-1,"There are ways of legally bringing — and drinking — your own booze on a flight, according to frequent flier Gilbert Ott.

On his blog God Save the Points, Ott provides the do's and don'ts of making it happen.

Whatever you do, never try and serve yourself.



Unless you're flying first class, chances are you're used to only getting one or two complimentary drinks on a flight — or at least having to pay for alcohol, even if it is just those mini bottles of wine available.

But, according to frequent traveller and air miles guru Gilbert Ott of God Save the Points, it's actually possible to legally bring – and drink — your own booze on board. Here's what you need to know:

You can make good use of the 100ml bottle rule...

While an entire bottle of whiskey won't make it through security, there's an easy way to get a smaller amount of your favourite tipple through.

""You’re probably aware that liquid containers may not exceed 100ml,"" Ott writes. ""Same goes for perfume, cosmetics, etc.

""Fortunately, mini alcohol bottles fit into the sizing requirements, and you can bring multiple mini bottles through security. It’s absolutely fine. Just put them in a clear plastic bag, just as you would any other liquid items.""

...or go shopping at duty-free.

Your second option is shopping for booze once you get into the airport lounge — as long as you're flying direct.

""If you’re travelling internationally, you could absolutely buy a bottle of wine or Champagne (anything you’ll consume entirely on the plane) on your next flight,"" Ott writes, warning: ""Don’t buy from duty-free if you have a connection where you’ll need to re-clear security before consuming. You’ll lose it!""

Whatever you do, don't try to serve yourself

""You CANNOT serve yourself on the plane. Any plane. No. You can’t,"" Ott stresses. ""You CAN however politely ask a member of the cabin crew if they would not mind serving you the liquor you brought on board.

""JetBlue famously made light of this policy last year — and we know many have successfully done this on other airlines around the world. There are no guarantees a crew will say YES — but this is real — and this happens.""

Be prepared to drink the whole bottle

While you might get a nice flight attendant willing to open your own bottle for you, you better be ready to drink the whole thing.

""Don’t ask the crew to open anything which will not be finished on board. And please, be discrete,"" Ott writes. ""The crew must dispose of anything open and unconsumed at the end of the flight. For that reason, it’s best to keep things simple.""

Don't overdo it

According to Ott, the crew have final say on your ability to consume alcohol — so be wise in your consumption.

""If they decide you look far too ready for midnight karaoke — they have full right to cut you off,"" he writes. ""In each and every circumstance — arguing with them is going to go poorly for you, so just don’t. Just sit back relax, enjoy the flight and politely persuade someone to pour you a lovely drink. You’ll be on the ground before you know it.""",This is how you can legally bring — and drink — your own booze on a flight
A doctor used his own sperm to impregnate her mom. ,https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/woman-discovers-father-parents-fertility-doctor-through-ancestry-dna-test/,"Notwithstanding the controversies over their reported inaccurate health risk assessments, it’s worth remembering that consumer genetic testing kits aren’t entirely erroneous. They do provide the user with some basic genetic curiosities – and in one case, it appears the revelation was a little more shocking than the customer bargained for.

As reported by BBC News, an American woman who sent a DNA sample to genealogy site Ancestry.com back in 2017 was shocked to find out that the results suggested she wasn’t related to her father. Although she initially expected that this was an error – telling her now-divorced parents as much – it transpired that Kelli Rowlette was related to the doctor who delivered her at birth, 36 years ago.

Gizmodo notes that, upon receipt of the results of the ancestry test, Ms Rowlette was baffled by the inclusion of Gerald Mortimer, but she didn’t know who he was right off the bat. That was only revealed when she stumbled across her birth certificate, which included the name of the doctor that delivered her. Until this point, her parents kept their shock at the news to themselves.

Her lawsuit is now seeking to prosecute the Idaho Falls obstetrician gynecologist, with whom her mother and her supposed father, Sally Ashby and Howard Fowler, respectively, consulted prior to birth. He’s up for fraud, medical negligence, battery, emotional distress, and breach of contract.

The plaintiffs also name the Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates of Idaho Falls in the lawsuit, whose members, they claim, knew about Dr Mortimer’s behavior.

According to the lawsuit, the married couple had trouble conceiving, due to a low sperm count and a uterine condition. The Washington Post explains that she had a retroverted uterus, in which the uterus is angled spinewards. It’s unclear how this affects fertility, though.

Consequently, the couple decided to be artificially inseminated using sperm from both her husband (85 percent) and a donor (15 percent), who was requested to be a university student with fairly specific physical characteristics. The idea was that by doubling up the sperm donors, there would be a better chance of successful insemination, although the science surrounding this method shows decidedly mixed results.

In any case, it seems that at some point, Dr Mortimer used his own sperm instead, without the knowledge of the parents. Ms Rowlette was born in 1981, and later, the couple had a son without any additional medical assistance.

According to Courthouse News, the lawsuit mentions that Ms Ashby, Mr Fowler, and their two children eventually moved away from Idaho Falls to Washington State.

“Dr. Mortimer cried when Ms. Ashby informed him they were moving. Dr. Mortimer knew Kelli Rowlette was his biological daughter but did not disclose this to Ms. Ashby or Mr. Fowler,” the 14-page complaint noted.",Woman Makes Horrifying Discovery Through Ancestry DNA Test
Paper towels. ,https://www.businessinsider.in/Scientists-compared-bathroom-hand-dryers-and-paper-towels-to-see-which-is-really-cleaner-and-the-winner-is-clear/articleshow/63718414.cms,"Advertisement

The air in a typical public restroom can be full of drug-resistant bacteria, and open-flush toilets help it fly up into the air.

Hand dryers can blow more potentially-pathogenic bathroom air around, and onto our hands, a new, independently-funded study shows.

One Connecticut health center is trading its hand dryers for paper towels, worried patients with compromised immune systems may be more at risk of catching something dangerous if they blow-dry their hands instead of wiping them dry.



Scientists have known for a while that bathroom air isn't exactly the most pristine stuff.

Public toilets can harbor handfuls of different drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus, and scientists have also shown that restrooms are teeming with a wide variety of microbes, many from other people's pee, skin, and certain, ahem... body parts.

But when it comes to the question of whether to dry one's hands on a paper towel, or blow them dry under a hand dryer, scientists have struggled to find a definitive answer to which is better for your health. Until now.

A new, independently-funded study of 36 men's and women's bathrooms at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine found that bathroom hand dryers blow tons of bacterial spores around. Researchers holding up test plates to hand dryer air found as many as 60 different bacterial colonies could be blown onto them during a 30-second air dry. Turns out, even though the air coming out of hand dryers is almost perfectly clean, it ends up pushing more nasty bathroom air around than a paper towel.

Lead study author Peter Setlow says his research find is not a shock.

""The more air ya move? The more bacteria stick,"" he told Business Insider. ""And there are a lot of bacteria in bathrooms.""

In fact, other scientists have discovered that ""toilet plumes"" from inside the bowl of a toilet can spray aerosolized feces as high as 15 feet into the air. And blowing more of that pooey air with a dryer around could cause some serious harm, especially for vulnerable populations like the old and the sick.

Setlow himself, a septuagenarian researcher, says he's stopped using hand dryers altogether after completing his independently-funded study. And he's not the only one. The University of Connecticut School of Medicine where the study was done has also started stocking paper towels in all its facilities.

Still, the general public may not need to be so concerned with how they dry their hands, Setlow says.

""If I'm a person whose immune system is suppressed, I wanna minimize my exposure to bacteria,"" he says, stressing that his own tactic may be most important to keep in mind for seniors and people with compromised immune systems, people who might struggle bouncing back from being exposed to bacteria that, in a healthy person, might not do much harm.

The truth is that most bacteria aren't bad for us. Microbes are essential to life on Earth. They were some of the earliest life-forms, before us oxygen-sniffing creatures even set foot on the planet. Today, they're an essential part of our own immunity. They even interact with and, at times, control our genes, feeding our brains and our nervous system. One New York City geneticist even suggests new parents roll their kids on the floor of the grimy New York subway, because there's some evidence suggesting exposure to a wide array of crawly microbes early-on helps our immune systems grow up strong and healthy.

And besides, just because bathroom air is grosser than other air, doesn't mean you need to be more squeamish about popping a squat than you are about picking up a call. Microbiologists routinely argue that toilet seats are time and again tested and found to be much cleaner surfaces than our cell phones, office desks and restaurant menus.

Given that around 20% percent of us don't even bother to wash our hands at all after we do our business in a public restroom, hand drying may not be the most serious issue in the bathroom, anyway.

Regular, thorough handwashing, especially before eating and after using the washroom is still the number one way to ensure we stay healthy and illness-free, no matter how you may choose to dry off your mitts afterwards.

“All of the negative energy from your room will be cleaned.” ,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-lemon-health-benefits,"Lemons are high in vitamin C, fiber, and various beneficial plant compounds. These nutrients are responsible for several health benefits. In fact, lemons may support heart health, weight control, and digestive health. Here are 6 evidence-based health benefits of lemons. Share on Pinterest

1. Support Heart Health Lemons are a good source of vitamin C. One lemon provides about 31 mg of vitamin C, which is 51% of the reference daily intake (RDI). Research shows that eating fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C reduces your risk of heart disease and stroke ( 1 , 2 , 3 ). However, it’s not only the vitamin C that is thought to be good for your heart. The fiber and plant compounds in lemons could also significantly lower some risk factors for heart disease ( 4 , 5 ). For instance, one study revealed that eating 24 grams of citrus fiber extract daily for a month reduced total blood cholesterol levels (6). Plant compounds found in lemons — namely hesperidin and diosmin — have also been found to lower cholesterol ( 7 , 8 , 9). SUMMARY

Lemons are high in heart-healthy vitamin C

and several beneficial plant compounds that may lower cholesterol.

2. Help Control Weight Lemons are often promoted as a weight loss food, and there are a few theories as to why this is. One common theory is that the soluble pectin fiber in them expands in your stomach, helping you feel full for longer. That said, not many people eat lemons whole. And because lemon juice contains no pectin, lemon juice drinks will not promote fullness in the same way. Another theory suggests that drinking hot water with lemon will help you lose weight. However, drinking water is known to temporarily increase the number of calories you burn, so it may be the water itself that is helping with weight loss — not the lemon ( 10 , 11 ). Other theories suggest that the plant compounds in lemons may aid weight loss. Research shows that plant compounds in lemon extracts may help prevent or reduce weight gain in a number of ways ( 12 , 13 ). In one study, mice on a fattening diet were given lemon polyphenols extracted from the peel. They gained less weight and body fat than other mice ( 14 ). However, no studies confirm the weight loss effects of lemon compounds in humans. SUMMARY

Animal studies show that lemon extract and

plant compounds may promote weight loss, but the effects in humans are unknown.

3. Prevent Kidney Stones Kidney stones are small lumps that form when waste products crystallize and build up in your kidneys. They are quite common, and people who get them often get them repeatedly. Citric acid may help prevent kidney stones by increasing urine volume and increasing urine pH, creating a less favorable environment for kidney stone formation ( 15 , 16 ). Just a 1/2-cup (4 ounces or 125 ml) of lemon juice per day may provide enough citric acid to help prevent stone formation in people who have already had them ( 17 , 18 ). Some studies also found that lemonade effectively prevented kidney stones, but the results have been mixed. Other studies have shown no effect ( 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ). Therefore, more well-conducted studies need to examine whether lemon juice affects kidney stone formation ( 23 , 24 , 25 ). SUMMARY

Lemon juice may help prevent

kidney stones. However, more quality research is needed.

4. Protect Against Anemia Iron deficiency anemia is quite common. It occurs when you don’t get enough iron from the foods you eat. Lemons contain some iron, but they primarily prevent anemia by improving your absorption of iron from plant foods ( 26 , 27 ). Your gut absorbs iron from meat, chicken, and fish (known as heme iron) very easily, while iron from plant sources (non-heme iron) not as easily. However, this absorption can be improved by consuming vitamin C and citric acid. Because lemons contain both vitamin C and citric acid, they may protect against anemia by ensuring that you absorb as much iron as possible from your diet. SUMMARY

Lemons contain vitamin C and

citric acid, which help you absorb non-heme iron from plants. This may prevent

anemia.

5. Reduce Cancer Risk A healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables may help prevent some cancers ( 28 ). Some observational studies have found that people who eat the most citrus fruit have a lower risk of cancer, while other studies have found no effects ( 29 , 30 , 31 ). In test-tube studies, many compounds from lemons have killed cancer cells. However, they may not have the same effect on the human body ( 32 , 33 , 34 ). Some researchers think that plant compounds found in lemons — such as limonene and naringenin — could have anticancer effects, but this hypothesis needs further investigation ( 5 , 35 , 36 , 37 ). Animal studies indicate that D-limonene, a compound found in lemon oil, does have anticancer properties ( 38 , 39 ). Another study used pulp from mandarins that contained the plant compounds beta-cryptoxanthin and hesperidin, which are also found in lemons. The study discovered that these compounds prevented malignant tumors from developing in the tongues, lungs, and colons of rodents ( 40 ). However, it should be noted that the research team used a very high dose of the chemicals — far more than you would get by eating lemons or oranges. While some plant compounds from lemons and other citrus fruits may have anticancer potential, no quality evidence suggests that lemons can fight cancer in humans. SUMMARY

Some plant chemicals found in

lemons have been shown to prevent cancer in animal studies. However, human

studies are needed.

6. Improve Digestive Health Lemons are made up of about 10% carbs, mostly in the form of soluble fiber and simple sugars. The main fiber in lemons is pectin, a form of soluble fiber linked to multiple health benefits. Soluble fiber can improve gut health and slow the digestion of sugars and starches. These effects may result in reduced blood sugar levels ( 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ). However, to get the benefits of fiber from lemons, you need to eat the pulp. People who drink lemon juice, without the fiber found in the pulp, will miss out on the benefits of the fiber. SUMMARY The soluble fiber in lemons could help improve digestive

health. However,

you need to eat the pulp of the lemon, not just the juice.",6 Evidence-Based Health Benefits of Lemons
"Apply an antihistamine cream to the area, or take an antihistamine pill. ",https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-the-best-way-to-stop-a-mosquito-bite-from-itching,"For many of us, mozzie bites are an unavoidable part of life if we want the luxury of having our balcony door open on a summer's night or evening drinks on the harbour.

But apart from not scratching them at all - and come on now, let's not get too crazy - what's the most effective way of minimising the itch?

The key is in how our immune system responds to a mosquito bite in the first place.

When you're bitten, a mosquito will use its sharp, tubular proboscis to deliver saliva that's full of anticoagulants to the blood, which thins it out for quick and easy siphoning.

As researchers discovered back in 2012, these mouthparts are so small, they actually pierce individual blood cells and suck them dry.

The first ever time you get bitten by a mosquito in your life, you won't feel a thing, because your immune system hasn't had a chance to develop a coordinated response.

But once it does, it will know to deliver an unrelenting burst of histamines to the dried-up, shrunken blood cells, and these are what turns the bite wound into a red, swollen, and itchy disaster area.

This is one of those cases where your immune system ends up causing more harm than good, so the best solution to combat a histamine-related itch is to douse it in antihistamines, as Rebecca Harrington explains over at Business Insider:

""If the itch is too much to bear, apply an antihistamine cream or gel to the area, or take an antihistamine pill, recommends the US Food and Drug Administration. Look for ""Diphenhydramine"" in the ingredients list - Benadryl has it. Both the cream and the pills can be found over the counter and are pretty inexpensive.""

Those pills can even be taken as a precaution beforehand, to deal with the inflammation as soon as you are bitten.

While antihistamines are the most widely accepted treatment for mosquito bites, there have been questions over just how effective they are.

In 2012, a study published in the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin reviewed the available evidence for how over-the-counter treatments dealt with the itch of bug bites, and found ""little direct evidence for the efficacy of treatments for simple insect bites, and, in general, recommendations for treatment are based on expert opinion and clinical experience.""

They added that with ointments containing antiseptics, antihistamines, or numbing agents such as lidocaine and benzocaine only appeared to help ""sometimes"".

That said, ""sometimes"" is better than nothing, the researchers concluded, and having reviewed all available options, came to this recommendation:

""For mild local reactions, the area should be cleaned and a cold compress applied. Oral analgesics can be given for pain, and a mild corticosteroid cream applied to reduce inflammation and itching. Large local reactions can be treated with an oral antihistamine. Non-sedating antihistamines are preferred during the day, but a sedating antihistamine can be of use at night if sleep is disturbed. Antibacterial treatment is not required for simple insect bites, but secondary infections should be treated with an oral antibacterial agent in accordance with local guidelines.""

And here's some rather confronting footage of a mosquito's flexible proboscis probing a blood cell. Know your enemy, I say.

Because they instinctually want to follow their family. ,https://be.chewy.com/is-this-normal-why-do-dogs-follow-you-into-the-bathroom/,"Much like parents of human children, all pet parents know that having a dog means you rarely go to the bathroom alone. For some strange reason, dogs love to follow us to the porcelain palace, where they sustain the most uncomfortable kind of eye contact ever. (Well, maybe the second most-uncomfortable, right behind that time you accidentally locked eyes with your mother while you all watched “Superbad.”)

That’s certainly the case for dog mom Leigh, a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based marketing and PR professional whose roughly 10-year-old rescue Chihuahua, El Vez, has been following her into the bathroom ever since she first brought him home.

“We have excellent conversations and brainstorming in the bathroom,” she says.

The morning chats are nice and all, but why do dogs follow you into the bathroom, taking a seat right beside the toilet every time we do our business? It's apparently not because they're returning the favor, after watching us stand beside them while they do their own thing outside.

In fact, it’s kind of our fault.

“We’ve bred them for hundreds of years, if not thousands, to want to be near us,” says Kayla Fratt, an International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC)-certified dog behavior consultant and the owner of Journey Dog Training in Missoula, Montana. ""It absolutely makes sense for them to follow us from room to room, and there’s no real reason for them not to follow us into the bathroom.""

So, it’s not because they’re being little creeps who like to watch us poop. Actually, Fratt says there's ""no indication"" that they even know what a bathroom is—or what we're doing in there.

""Even if they 'know' what you’re doing, why would it matter to them?"" she says. ""It’s certainly reading too much into things to assume that your dog is being gross or weird. He just wants to be near you. It’s really that simple.""

The same goes for whether they’re watching us relieve ourselves or take a shower or do our makeup. The fact that SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS can happen in the bathroom just might be part of the reason why our dogs are so curious about it.

""Sometimes you go in there for a minute or two, and sometimes when you take a bath, it might be for an hour,"" says Paul Sheinberg, CPDT-KA, founder and primary dog trainer of Pawsitive Paul's Dog Training in Baltimore, Maryland. ""Because of that uncertainty, dogs tend to follow you when you’re going toward that direction, if you have that type of dog that sticks by you or gets nervous when you leave.""

On the flip side, if your dog doesn't follow you into the bathroom (or anywhere else in the house), that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with them—or with you.

""Some dogs are just more Velcro-y than others. They follow and shadow their people more,"" Fratt says. “It’s more common in some shepherding breeds than in some more aloof breeds, but it’s not abnormal dog behavior at all.""

If you'd prefer to have a few minutes to yourself, it's not difficult to train your dog to let you walk down the hall and into the bathroom without them.

""By far, the easiest way is to teach them a basic ‘stay’ and when you’re done with your business, give them a treat or some praise for being so brave on their own,"" Sheinberg says. She suggests teaching the stay command without the use of the bathroom, first, just to get your dog used to it. Then, once they’ve mastered the command, transition to the bathroom area for small durations throughout the day to practice. “It should be rectified in a positive and fun way within days.""

So, there you have it. It’s perfectly normal for dogs to follow you into the bathroom—and perfectly normal if they don’t. The only cause for concern would be if your dog gets seriously anxious about being alone while you’re in the bathroom, even for a few minutes. It could be a sign of separation anxiety in dogs.

""If not following you into the bathroom makes your dog distressed, it’s time to get help,"" Fratt advises. She suggests calling a certified dog behavior consultant or another behavior expert—rather than an obedience trainer—to work through the issue.

Back in Pittsburgh, Leigh says El Vez has actually been giving her a little more space lately. ""I will say, since quarantine, I've noticed that it's happening less and less,"" she says. ""He actually seems to be actively trying to find time to socially distance himself from us humans.""",Why Do Dogs Follow You Into the Bathroom?

A Chicago dad was seriously injured and his 7-year-old daughter killed by gunshots while they were sitting in a drive-thru at a McDonald’s Sunday afternoon.

Police have identified the father as 29-year-old Jontae Adams and his daughter as Jaslyn.

The shooting happened around 4:18 p.m. local time in the Windy City’s Homan Square neighborhood, in the 3200 block of W. Roosevelt, Chicago police told Fox News.

A McDonald's employee who asked not to be named told the Chicago Sun-Times that two people got out of a gray car in the drive-thru and started shooting at Adams' car.

Police said the two victims were inside a vehicle near a parking lot ""when they heard gunshots and felt pain.""

The girl, who has three siblings, was struck ""multiple times"" to the body, and the dad was struck to the torso, police said.

A video shot by a bystander at the scene shows officers pulling the victims out of the car. The moment officers pull the 7-year-old girl from the passenger side, a person off-camera can be heard shouting: ""Oh s---! They killed a baby!""

Have a growth mindset. Make an effort to be happy. Help others. Have deep conversations. Get enough sleep. Stay positive. Surround themselves with the right people. Spend money on other people. Exercise. Slow down to appreciate life’s little pleasures. Saved you 13 clicks. ,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ten-habits-incredibly-happy-people-paul-zobel,"By Travis Bradberry - author of the best-selling book Emotional Intelligence 2.0

We’re always chasing something—be it a promotion, a new car, or a significant other. This leads to the belief that, “When (blank) happens, I’ll finally be happy.”

While these major events do make us happy at first, research shows this happiness doesn’t last. A study from Northwestern University measured the happiness levels of regular people against those who had won large lottery prizes the year prior. The researchers were surprised to discover that the happiness ratings of both groups were practically identical.

The mistaken notion that major life events dictate your happiness and sadness is so prevalent that psychologists have a name for it: impact bias. The reality is, event-based happiness is fleeting.

Happiness is synthetic—you either create it, or you don’t. Happiness that lasts is earned through your habits. Supremely happy people have honed habits that maintain their happiness day in, day out. Try out their habits, and see what they do for you:

1. They slow down to appreciate life’s little pleasures. By nature, we fall into routines. In some ways, this is a good thing. It saves precious brainpower and creates comfort. However, sometimes you get so caught up in your routine that you fail to appreciate the little things in life. Happy people know how important it is to savor the taste of their meal, revel in the amazing conversation they just had, or even just step outside to take a deep breath of fresh air.

2. They exercise. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a neurotransmitter that makes your brain feel soothed and keeps you in control of your impulses. Happy people schedule regular exercise and follow through on it because they know it pays huge dividends for their mood.

3. They spend money on other people. Research shows that spending money on other people makes you much happier than spending it on yourself. This is especially true of small things that demonstrate effort, such as going out of your way to buy your friend a book that you know they will like.

4. They surround themselves with the right people. Happiness spreads through people. Surrounding yourself with happy people builds confidence, stimulates creativity, and it’s flat-out fun. Hanging around negative people has the opposite effect. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. Think of it this way: If a person were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You’d distance yourself, and you should do the same with negative people.

5. They stay positive. Bad things happen to everyone, including happy people. Instead of complaining about how things could have been or should have been, happy people reflect on everything they’re grateful for. Then they find the best solution available to the problem, tackle it, and move on. Nothing fuels unhappiness quite like pessimism. The problem with a pessimistic attitude, apart from the damage it does to your mood, is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you expect bad things, you’re more likely to experience negative events. Pessimistic thoughts are hard to shake off until you recognize how illogical they are. Force yourself to look at the facts, and you’ll see that things are not nearly as bad as they seem.

6. They get enough sleep. I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep to improving your mood, focus, and self-control. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, removing toxic proteins that accumulate during the day as byproducts of normal neuronal activity. This ensures that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your energy, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough quality sleep. Sleep deprivation also raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. Happy people make sleep a priority, because it makes them feel great and they know how lousy they feel when they’re sleep deprived.

7. They have deep conversations. Happy people know that happiness and substance go hand-in-hand. They avoid gossip, small talk, and judging others. Instead they focus on meaningful interactions. They engage with other people on a deeper level, because they know that doing so feels good, builds an emotional connection, and is an interesting way to learn.

8. They help others. Taking the time to help people not only makes them happy, but it also makes you happy. Helping other people gives you a surge of oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine, all of which create good feelings. In a Harvard study, employees who helped others were 10 times more likely to be focused at work and 40% more likely to get a promotion. The same study showed that people who consistently provided social support were the most likely to be happy during times of high stress. As long as you make certain that you aren’t over committing yourself, helping others is sure to have a positive influence on your mood.

9. They make an effort to be happy. No one wakes up feeling happy every day and supremely happy people are no exception. They just work at it harder than everyone else. They know how easy it is to get sucked into a routine where you don’t monitor your emotions or actively try to be happy and positive. Happy people constantly evaluate their moods and make decisions with their happiness in mind.

10. They have a growth mindset. People’s core attitudes fall into one of two categories: a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. With a fixed mindset, you believe you are who you are and you cannot change. This creates problems when you’re challenged, because anything that appears to be more than you can handle is bound to make you feel hopeless and overwhelmed. People with a growth mindset believe that they can improve with effort. This makes them happier because they are better at handling difficulties. They also outperform those with a fixed mindset because they embrace challenges, treating them as opportunities to learn something new.

Bringing It All Together

Happiness can be tough to maintain, but investing in the right habits pays off. Adopting even a few of the habits from this list will make a big difference in your mood.

Some French baguette sellers are describing it as ‘fake news’, but recent statistics show that the burger is outselling the traditional ham baguette. Zut alors! Is it true?

France has fallen in love with burgers

No matter which French city you are in, it is now much easier to find a hamburger than ever before. What used to be a niche food, reserved for fast food American outlets, has undoubtedly become mainstream. While the French used to be a bit snooty about American food, they have made the burger their own – go to any major town in France and you’ll trip over home-made burger restaurants selling top-notch meat in achingly hip buns. It is said that 85% of French restaurants now serve burgers à la carte.

Chris Evan's butt. Picture in comments. ,https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/4/17200010/avengers-infinity-war-captain-america-butt-poster,"Marvel Entertainment released a veritable blitz of character posters for Avengers: Infinity War today, 22 in all, but there’s only one that’s taken Twitter by storm.

It’s the poster for Chris Evans’ Captain America, featuring the superhero in three-quarters profile with his back to the camera, a Wakandan shield strapped to his arm. But the attention isn’t on Evans’ beautiful blue peepers — though they do pop quite nicely from the dark tones of the poster, don’t they?

No, it’s all about another of his considerable ... assets.

The effect of the poster may have been enhanced slightly by the way Twitter algorithmically crops its thumbnail images to be weighted toward text, which makes the whole situation a little difficult to ignore.

In the replies to Evans’ own tweet of the poster, which is cropped in the same way when it appears in the main Twitter timeline, the response is strong and consistent:

OF COURSE Captain America's butt has to be on the poster. The sexualization of our star-spangled hero has become outright disgusting... LMAO who am I kidding my guy @ChrisEvans is killing that pose, I ain't even mad ‍♂️ https://t.co/MxPX9lS71T — chamo (@jcaruci_) April 4, 2018

For other users, there was a bit of a victory in equal butt-rights in the poster. The three-quarters pose, shot from behind, is a common trope of action movie posters — at least when it comes to female leads. This Captain America poster isn’t the first time the butt-pose trope has been flipped to use with a male lead, but it’s still a notable exception to the rule.

"United accepts higher-risk, short-nosed dog breeds that other airlines don't. ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2018/04/04/more-dogs-die-on-united-than-on-any-other-airline-heres-why/,"Of the 506,994 animals that flew on U.S. commercial air carriers last year, 24 died in transit. And 18 of those deaths — 75 percent — occurred on United Airlines.

Turns out that not only does #United kill puppies because of poorly educated stewardesses, but 18 of the 24 dogs that died on planes last year were on United planes. If you are a dog lover, avoid #United. — Tom Eggert (@madisonthom) March 14, 2018

For context, United transports more animals in the United States than any other airline: Last year, the airline transported about 27 percent of all animals flown as air cargo. Even so, people saw these disproportionately high numbers from 2017 as evidence that United has a history of mistreating animals, and that the airline is inherently less safe for transporting animals than any other major U.S. carrier.

Story continues below advertisement

And United’s steep numbers aren’t new. Going back further, United also reported the highest numbers of animal deaths in 2015 and 2016, especially when compared with other major U.S. carriers such as Delta and American. (Spirit, Southwest, JetBlue and Virgin America do not transport animals on their planes as cargo, though some small pets are allowed as carry-ons.)

But it turns out that United’s sky-high numbers of recent pet deaths may be more complicated than they appear at first glance.

While United does carry a disproportionate number of the animals who die on planes, the airline says the disparity results from one simple variable: United accepts higher-risk dog breeds that other major U.S. carriers do not allow.

These types of dogs are known as brachycephalic, or “short-nosed” or “snub-nosed,” breeds. Their airways are more compact, which tends to lead to respiratory issues. The short-nosed breeds include bulldogs, boxers, pugs, Boston terriers, Pekingese, mastiffs, shih tzus and others.

Story continues below advertisement

For years, American and Delta have refused to ship these types of dogs, arguing that the risk of death or injury (and liability to the airline) was too high.

Up until last month, United continued to accept “snub-nosed” breeds for cargo shipments.

The airline’s rationale: For people who needed to travel with a boxer or a bulldog, United was often the only way their dog could travel by air. United says they consistently alerted customers to the heightened danger of putting their higher-risk dog on a plane. But ultimately, they say, airline representatives left it to customers to decide whether their pet could handle the trip.

That explanation for the disparity is borne out, at least somewhat, by data on animal deaths that is kept by the U.S. Transportation Department.

We looked at the recorded animal deaths from 2015 to 2017. In those three years, 85 animals died while in the care of a U.S. air carrier. Of those deaths, 41 occurred on United.

Nearly 40 percent of those deaths occurred to a dog that was identified as a higher-risk breed — a breed that is barred on American or Delta Air Lines. In many of those cases, post-mortem examinations of the animal led the airline to conclude that there was nothing they could have done to prevent the animal’s death.

The deaths of these higher-risk dogs made up half of all dog deaths; there were also a handful of cats, reptiles and birds that died while in United’s care during those three years.

Of the three largest airlines that accommodate animals — United, Delta and American — the type of dog that died most frequently from 2015 to 2017 was the American bully, a breed known for its big jowls and squashed nose.

Five of the six American bully deaths occurred on United because the dog is banned by Delta and American Airlines. (Apparently, Delta made an exception for one such dog in 2015; that dog died en route from Savannah, Ga., to Atlanta, the first leg of a longer trip.)

Of the nine dog breeds with the highest incidence of death on these three major airlines, four are brachycephalic breeds that are allowed only on United.

So, why not ban those breeds altogether?

That’s something that United may consider. The airline has temporarily suspended its animal shipping program, at least until May, as company officials conduct a top-to-bottom assessment of its own animal cargo practices.

They may decide that those animals are too high-risk and that the financial opportunity cornering the market on transporting America’s population of pugs and bulldogs may not worth the legal liability.

Still, an all-out ban could be onerous for the owners.

Charles Hobart, a spokesman for United, pointed out that United accommodates 3,000 pet-owning military families per year. When those families own a brachycephalic dog, and they are reassigned to an overseas military posting, United is sometimes their only means to ship their pet. Otherwise, they would have to give their dog away.

“Our goal is to help keep families together, and dogs are part of the family,” Hobart said. “A lot of times, families just don’t have an option.”

Kitty Block, acting president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, said that’s no excuse for the higher rate of death on United’s flights. She doesn’t want to see an all-out ban on the snub-nosed dogs, she said. Instead, she wants United to find ways to accommodate the special needs of those high-risk breeds.

“The fact is that while there is some risk with traveling with a brachycephalic breed on a plane, traveling with them in the cabin can be done safely if the right measures are taken by both the owner and the airline,” Block said. “And that is what we’re asking for — that airlines take steps to reduce the risk of flying with pets, regardless of breed, as much as possible.”

In the meantime, Hobart said, United is taking other steps to improve the quality of service for people transporting their pets by air — particularly in light of another high-profile incident, in which a German shepherd was accidentally sent to Japan instead of its intended destination of Kansas City, Mo.

The Kansas-bound German shepherd that United Airlines mistakenly shipped to Japan reunited with its family on March 15. (Kara Swindle)

Hobart said the company has instituted new procedures to ensure that animals are loaded onto the correct airplane and that animals are not accidentally left behind or sent to the wrong destination.

From now on, Hobart said, “a member of management will be on the ramp to confirm that the loading and offloading is taking place in compliance with the planned route of flight and manifest.” The new procedures require another manager to follow up with the data provided by the ramp supervisor “to cross-check and verify before an animal can be released for departure,” he said.

Additionally, United will now automatically send daily reports to airport managers around the country, alerting them about what animals to expect to arrive and depart from their airport.",More dogs die on United than on any other airline. Here’s why.
They're underpaid. ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/west-virginia-teachers-strike-deal.html,"“It appears the strike will end,” Mr. Lee said after the deal was announced.

The pay raise was the main point of contention in the final days of the strike, but the teachers have also demanded some relief from sharply rising health insurance costs. The governor has promised to address that issue through a state task force. Both union leaders and rank-and-file teachers have welcomed that move.

“I think it’s a step in the right direction,” said Kerry Guerini, a teacher from Fayette County, who stood in the Capitol on Tuesday with a sign that said, “Will teach for insurance.”

“A 5 percent raise isn’t going to feel like very much when we have so much coming out for insurance,” Ms. Guerini said. Nevertheless, she added, “I’m ready to go back.”

Mr. Carmichael, whose resistance to the raises had made him a key antagonist for the striking teachers, insisted on Tuesday that he did not want to pass anything “just to appease a special-interest group.” The deal came about, he said, because lawmakers decided to offset the cost of the raises with budget cuts, rather than rely on optimistic revenue estimates the governor had offered.

The raises for state workers were expected to cost the state treasury a total of about $110 million a year. Some of the money for the raises would be redirected from amounts the governor had requested for tourism promotion and the state Department of Commerce, but lawmakers in the Senate said additional spending cuts would probably be required. Mr. Blair, the Republican who heads the Senate’s Finance Committee, said in a meeting that some of the money could be taken from Medicaid.

Mr. Carmichael told reporters that the scale of Medicaid cuts was “not absolutely determined,” because lawmakers were still “scouring the budget” for more places to cut.",West Virginia Raises Teachers’ Pay to End Statewide Strike
She thought she felt a spider on her (but it was her hair) and freaked out causing her to slip. ,https://www.allure.com/story/suave-bs-hair-ads-tricks,"Suave is all about keeping it real. The personal care brand, known for its affordable and effective hair and body products, is calling B.S. on the crazy tricks used in typical hair commercials. You know, the ones that you see, give the side-eye and think, ""there's no way that's real.""

Research shows that 74 percent of millennial women think hair shown in ads is unachievable. Turns out, it’s sad but true. “We know hair-care brands often use exaggerated claims and show some ridiculous situations in their ads and we can admit, Suave has had its own share of fancy hair flips in the past,” Jennifer Bremner, director of marketing for Suave, tells Allure. “But we also know that we don’t need to rely on advertising tricks and decided to have some fun while showing women everywhere how crazy those practices look when you really see it up close.”

So, Suave created a video to show just how ridiculous and unrealistic some of these commercials are. The video starts off with a model against a green screen with rods — yes, rods — going through her hair to make it appear flowy and wind-blown. Next, another model is shown laying down with seemingly long perfect waves, but when she gets up, you can see the hair extensions glued to the platform. And as for the volume?

Altruism (selfless concern for the well-being of others.) ,https://www.businessinsider.in/One-quality-in-men-might-be-even-more-attractive-than-good-looks-and-a-sense-of-humor/articleshow/53726873.cms,"Advertisement

Most people would think if it's not good looks that make a man most attractive to women, then it's definitely a sense of humor.

But studies consistently show that altruism is a top quality women are drawn to when they are looking for a relationship.

And a new study in the British Journal of Psychology found altruistic men may have more sex, too.

The researchers asked unmarried Canadian adults how much they did good deeds like giving money to charity, or helping someone get their car out of the snow. They then asked the participants how often they had sex and how many partners they've had.

Men who reported more altruistic acts had more sex - and more partners. For those who were in relationships, good-hearted men were more likely to have had more sex in the last 30 days, too.

Advertisement

In the second experiment of the study, the researchers had undergraduate students say whether they would like to donate money they might receive for participating to charity. Those who said they would also tended to have more casual sex, more sex in relationships, and more lifetime sex partners overall.

Another study, published in January 2016 in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, presented 202 women with different men to choose from. The different combinations of choices were either attractive or not, and they either did a good deed or didn't.

The women chose the selfish, attractive men for a one-night stand. But for a long-term relationship, they chose the altruistic man whether he was attractive or not.

A slightly older study, published in The Journal of Social Psychology in 2013, really drives this home. That study found that women valued altruism above other traits as a measure of whether a potential mate would make a good parent. The women also said that altruism was important for short-term relationships, but significantly more women said the trait mattered for the long-term.

Yet another study, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in July 2015, analyzed Germans' responses to a large annual survey.

Single people who reported doing good deeds were much more likely to say they were in a relationship the next year. They also took less time to find a partner than their non-altruistic peers.

All of this is not to say other traits don't matter. Humor is also important to women selecting a mate, researchers have found. It makes women assume a man is more intelligent.

A sense of humor is a good indicator of sexual activity, too. In one study, men who women rated as funnier reported having more sex with more partners.

For building long-term relationships, though, researchers find over and over again that altruism is a crucial and highly desirable trait.

Advertisement

Psychologists have yet to pit humor head-to-head against altruism. It's also important to keep in mind that many of these studies are small, and that people often behave differently in real life than they do in a lab setting, or when responding to a survey. Especially when reporting positive experiences like charity work or sex, men may be more likely to overestimate how much they actually do those things. And due to the way these kinds of studies are designed, they can't say conclusively that it's altruism specifically that's attractive; it might be other traits associated with altruism, or that men attractive for other reasons might also happen to be altruistic.

But the large number of studies and the consistent findings in favor of altruism are building a pretty solid case that there are some side benefits to doing good deeds. No matter what, if you're a man seeking a woman - especially for a long-term partnership - helping others can't hurt.",One quality in men might be even more attractive than good looks and a sense of humor

New Zealand Keeps Being Left off World Maps – and Here's Why

World Map Without New Zealand | © Pixabay

Thalita Alves 12 April 2018 View

Where in the world is New Zealand? That question might be a no-brainer for a wanderlusting traveller plotting out their bucket list – but it appears mapmakers from all corners of the globe aren’t finding the Antipodean country quite as memorable.

Play a game of Risk and you won’t find any trace of New Zealand. Watch a popular TV series like Star Trek and, yep, there’s another map without it. Video games, t-shirt designs, wall decor, Christmas cards, in-flight magazines and even institutions that should have known better (we’re looking at you, United Nations) occasionally forget about that little country in the corner of the Pacific.

And naturally, New Zealanders aren’t all that happy about it.

This woeful omission inspired a community of sharp-eyed, social-media-savvy Kiwis to document what seems like an endless existential battle. In recent years, the subreddit MapsWithoutNZ and the Tumblr World Maps Without New Zealand have made it their mission to remind the world that, hey, this country still exists. More than 28,000 Redditors are subscribed to MapsWithoutNZ, which is updated on a daily basis.

But why does this innocent nation keep on getting the geographical cold shoulder?

Some, like the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, default to the classic excuse that they simply ‘ran out of room’. Others will say that the country accidentally got swallowed by some pesky clouds. And, to be fair, you can’t really expect a show like The Simpsons to be preoccupied with the intricate details of cartography.

Ask a handful of people on the street to look at a map without New Zealand, as the BBC recently did, and you might get a mixed reaction – some will be quick to spot the missing piece of the puzzle, while others will simply overlook it because ‘it’s so tiny, nobody notices.’

Despite their dismay at being ignored time and again, New Zealanders remain in good spirits about the whole ordeal. In fact, even the country’s government is in on the joke – its 404 Error page pays a fitting tribute to the country’s continuous battle for recognition.",New Zealand Keeps Being Left off World Maps – and Here's Why
Wear cotton and wash them. ,https://lifehacker.com/how-to-keep-your-workout-clothes-from-stinking-1824073531,"Sweaty clothes stink, but sweaty workout clothes stink worst of all. Like those synthetic-fiber leggings, those sweat-wicking socks, those “technical” tees? Phew. These fabrics are especially prone to harboring the smelliest bacteria.



Advertisement

You see, our sweat doesn’t stink on its own; bacteria that live on our skin digest our sweat and oils, and they’re the ones stinking up the place.

Polyester clothing provides an especially good home to Micrococcus bacteria after a sweaty workout, according to a 2014 study published in Applied Environmental Microbiology. The authors note that airy mesh and wicking fabrics also help the bacteria get plenty of oxygen, and that once the clothing is off our skin, our immune systems don’t keep their numbers in check.

Cotton doesn’t grow bacteria as well, and it also tends to trap some of the stink inside its fibers, where we can’t smell it. Another bonus for cotton: detergents work pretty well to remove the stink, the sweat, and the bacteria responsible. Synthetic fibers, on the other hand, are smooth and slightly oily. Detergents have a hard time getting the bacteria off.

So what can you do? Based on the science and my personal experience, I can recommend two things:

Wear cotton . It may feel sweatier when you’re wearing it, but if you don’t mind (and aren’t doing winter workouts in a situation where hypothermia is an issue), it will de-stink in the laundry just fine.



. It may feel sweatier when you’re wearing it, but if you don’t mind (and aren’t doing winter workouts in a situation where hypothermia is an issue), it will de-stink in the laundry just fine. Rinse your workout gear right away. I toss any synthetic clothes onto the floor of my shower before I hop in. Either before or after I wash myself, I rinse my clothes and squeeze them out. This removes a lot of the sweat and bacteria before they can combine to cause a big stink.

I find that after prompt rinsing, I can hang my gear up in the shower (I have hooks in there for exactly this reason) and it’s stink-free once it’s dry. Every couple wearings, I rinse it and then toss it in the regular laundry. But if you want to be really thorough, consider washing your stuff with detergent immediately after your workout.",How to Keep Your Workout Clothes From Stinking

70 days in advance. ,https://lifehacker.com/the-best-time-to-buy-fights-based-on-917-million-airfa-1824233023,"Anyone who has ever purchased a plane ticket can tell you there’s a “right” and “wrong” time to buy.

Plane ticket prices fluctuate, and when you purchase your ticket can mean a difference of literally hundreds of dollars, depending on where you’re traveling to.

Travel booking site CheapAir.com recently revealed the results of its 2018 Airfare study, a study where it looked at 917 million different flights listed on its site to determine where the perfect time to buy is. The results are pretty interesting.

The big question: How far in advance should you buy?

Everyone knows a last-minute plane ticket is probably expensive, but how far in advance do you need to purchase a ticket is a little less known.

According to the study, the best window of time to purchase a ticket in 2017 was 70 days in advance, a bit higher than the sweet spot in 2016 which was 54 days. However, that 70 was an average. The “best” time to buy actually depends on the season when you plan to travel.

In winter you want to try for 62 days in advance, spring 90 days in advance, summer 47 days in advance, and fall 69 days in advance, on average.

And as for that theory that there’s a best day of the week to buy—CheapAir says that’s not really true. Airfare during the week traditionally doesn’t fluctuate more than $2 from day to day, so you’re fine buying a ticket any day you want.

When it comes to when you fly, there is a difference. The cheapest days to fly are Tuesday and Wednesday, while Sunday is the most expensive.

Setting goals

It's a good thing we live in happy times when just several lines of code can make your wish come true. Let's check what we can do with a regular Android phone.

Today we're going to write a short program that will work in background mode, gathering various data we need and then send it to a specified server.

We already created a similar nice application in one of our previous articles, but it was not able to run in the background. The reason lies in the app’s activity lifecycle. You are welcome to study this subject in detail. I'll give you just a brief description: once the system registers that the user stopped using an application, it goes to the queue for unloading from the memory to clear it for other tasks. So if we want the phone to collect the data throughout the day (and night) we should see to it.

We want our application to launch every now and then to take a photo with its front camera, record a short sound sample and send it all to a certain server. To make it flexible and adjustable let’s make it download a config file to check against once in a while.

Go!

Let's first create the XML configuration file. It will be downloaded once a day and parsed with XMLPullParser. In our case we should check for opening audio and photo tags. Clearly this class allow more opportunities, so creating flexible preferences will not be a problem. The preferences proper will be saved to Shared Preferences.

XmlPullParserFactory factory = XmlPullParserFactory.newInstance(); factory.setNamespaceAware(true); XmlPullParser parser = factory.newPullParser(); // Downloading XML-file from the specified address by GET and read it using InputStream HttpURLConnection urlConnection = null; URL url = new URL(""http://cc.server/config.xml""); urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); urlConnection.setRequestMethod(""GET""); urlConnection.connect(); InputStream input = urlConnection.getInputStream(); parser.setInput(input, null); int eventType = parser.getEventType(); // Checking the XML-file for opening tags while(eventType != XmlPullParser.END_DOCUMENT) { if(eventType == XmlPullParser.START_TAG) { if (parser.getName().contains(""photo"")) {ConfigUpdater.isPhoto=true;} else if (parser.getName().contains(""audio"")) {ConfigUpdater.isAudio=true;} eventType = parser.next(); } }

AsyncTask class allows to perform a resource-intensive task in the background mode. For example we can download files in the background without causing lags in the main application used at that moment.

public class LoadConfig extends AsyncTask<String, Void,Boolean> { private Exception exception; @Override protected Boolean doInBackground(String... urls) { try { // running a separate process for downloading and reading the config file parseXml(); } catch (Exception e) { this.exception = e; return null; } return null; } }

BroadcastReceiver class allows to sign up for receiving notifications on upcoming events in the OS. Upon receiving such notification the application will run the list of commands assigned by the developer. So after the OS registers the application as a recipient of certain notifications, it will run onReceive in appropriate class once the indicated event takes place. This works even if the phone's screen is locked or another demanding application is in use.

public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) { // We use AsyncTask to download and process the config file new LoadConfig().execute(); // The results are put in SharedPreferences sp = context.getSharedPreferences(""Config"", context.MODE_PRIVATE); sp.edit().putBoolean(""isAudio"", isAudio).commit(); sp.edit().putBoolean(""isPhoto"", isPhoto).commit(); }

The camera in Android can be accessed via graphical Intent or without user taking any actions. The latter makes it possible to take photos absolutely imperceptibly. We only need to determine the camera ID and use onPictureTaken method in PictureCallBack class.

private int findFrontFacingCamera() { int cameraId = -1; int numberOfCameras = Camera.getNumberOfCameras(); for (int i = 0; i < numberOfCameras; i++) { CameraInfo info = new CameraInfo(); Camera.getCameraInfo(i, info); // Looking through all the cameras to select the front camera if (info.facing == CameraInfo.CAMERA_FACING_FRONT) { cameraId = i; break; } } return cameraId; } cameraId = findFrontFacingCamera(); // Creating a new instance of the PhotoHandler class. We need it for saving a photo PhotoHandler phHandler = new PhotoHandler(camera); phHandler.setFile(file); camera.reconnect(); camera.startPreview(); camera.takePicture(null, null,phHandler);

Here is how the PhotoHandler is carried out. When creating a photo the OS will call the onPictureTaken method. It will receive a byte array containing the photo as its argument.

public class PhotoHandler implements PictureCallback { @Override public void onPictureTaken(byte[] data, Camera camera) { // Writing the byte array in the file FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pictureFile); fos.write(data); fos.close(); ourCamera.release(); ... } }

Recording the mic input will be just as easy. We will use MediaRecorder to do it. This class allows to record sound and video depending on the parameters we set. We will work only with sound this time.

MediaRecorder myAudioRecorder; String outputFile = audioFile.toString(); myAudioRecorder=new MediaRecorder(); // The sound should be recorded from the mic to 3GP format, sound processing algorithm AMR_NB myAudioRecorder.setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC); myAudioRecorder.setOutputFormat(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.THREE_GPP); myAudioRecorder.setAudioEncoder(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.AMR_NB);

According to the manual, the method (onReceive) called by BroadcastReceived will be terminated after 10 seconds. To record a longer sample we will create a separate thread using the Service class.

Intent audioIntent = new Intent(context, AudioService.class); context.startService(audioIntent);

When the service is started, the mic sound will be recorded by the onHandleIntent method.

public class AudioService extends IntentService { @Override protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) { recordAudio(); } ... }

The easiest way to upload the data is an ordinary POST request. We will use the HttpUrlConnection class for it.

FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(new File(myFile) ); URL myUrl = new URL(""http://cc.server/upload.php""); HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) myUrl.openConnection(); connection.setDoInput(true); connection.setDoOutput(true); connection.setUseCaches(false); // Initializing the POST request connection.setRequestMethod(""POST""); connection.setRequestProperty(""Connection"", ""Keep-Alive""); connection.setRequestProperty(""Content-Type"", ""multipart/form-data;boundary=""+boundary); // Opening a connection with the server and sending the file outputStream = new DataOutputStream( connection.getOutputStream() ); outputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + lineEnd); // Describing the request content according to RFC 1806 outputStream.writeBytes(""Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\""uploadedfile\"";filename=\"""" + myFile +""\"""" + lineEnd); outputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd); bytesAvailable = fileInputStream.available(); bufferSize = Math.min(bytesAvailable, maxBufferSize); buffer = new byte[bufferSize]; // Reading the file into buffer at the same time fixing its size bytesRead = fileInputStream.read(buffer, 0, bufferSize); while (bytesRead > 0) { outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bufferSize); bytesAvailable = fileInputStream.available(); bufferSize = Math.min(bytesAvailable, maxBufferSize); bytesRead = fileInputStream.read(buffer, 0, bufferSize); } outputStream.writeBytes(lineEnd); outputStream.writeBytes(twoHyphens + boundary + twoHyphens + lineEnd);

Now to make it all work we will enable our application to get system events notifications. The AlarmManager class allows us to schedule the launch of our application, let's make it every two hours. You are welcome to read the manual for more information.

Intent intentConfig = new Intent(this, ConfigUpdater.class); PendingIntent pIConfig = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this.getApplicationContext(), 31337, intentConfig, 0); AlarmManager aMConfig = (AlarmManager) getSystemService(ALARM_SERVICE); // From now on the app will start every two hours aMConfig.setRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, System.currentTimeMillis(), 7200000, pIConfig);

We also need to modify the AndroidManifest file so that our application could get permissions from the OS for creating files, Internet access, taking photographs, sound recording and reacting upon system events. During the installation of the app the system will notify the user about all the above (except for the system events). This is why it is important to pay attention to what permissions you give to an application. If a solitaire app requests permission to use the camera, it might be a malware solitaire.

You put money in the slot machine, pull the lever (or press the button, on most modern machines), and watch the symbols come up. You see one cherry, two cherries, then…

Suddenly, you realize what you’re looking at. You’ve won the jackpot, and you’re about to walk out of the casino a winner. Depending on the size of the jackpot, your life might change from this point forward.

We’re happy for you, but before you count your winnings, there are a few things you should know.

1. You’re going to have to fill out a tax form.

We’re going to assume that you won more than $1,200. Bad news: The IRS gets a cut.

You’re going to have to pay tax on all of your winnings, and the casino will issue you a W-2G form, a special IRS document designed specifically for “certain gambling winnings.” The good news is that if you’re a frequent gambler, you can deduct the money you spent while chasing that jackpot—provided, of course, that you kept records of both your wins and your losses.

2. A casino worker will quickly home in on you.

Expect a quick visit from one of the casino workers. Your jackpot win just sent a signal back to the casino’s monitoring room, so an attendant will rush over to verify your win. They’ll ask to see your identification, and you won’t get a cent until you show a valid government-issued I.D.

That applies to nonresident aliens, too; they’re eligible to win jackpots, but they’re also taxed, albeit at a different rate from U.S. residents. If you don’t have any identification, the casino will hold the money in safekeeping until you can provide some. Some casinos keep millions in their safekeeping accounts for years—by law, they’re not allowed to spend it.

Provided that you’ve got identification, however, the casino might just hand you your cash. Casinos take pride in fast “hand pays,” so don’t be surprised if the attendant has a bundle of $100 bills.

3. If you win more than $5,000, you’ll probably receive a check.

Probably, but not necessarily. In some states, casinos will hand out incredibly large sums of cash, and while they’ll happily get their security teams to escort you to your car, you’re on your own after that.

Casinos prefer to pay cash whenever possible, since it increases the chances that you’ll keep playing. Hey, they’re running a business, here.

Some state laws can complicate the payout. Before they hand you anything, they’ll have to verify that you’re not on the state’s exclusion list, and if you are, you’re not getting a cent (otherwise, the casino could face a hefty fine). This is meant to deter addicted gamblers from relapsing. Hey, why play if you’ll never win?

Generally, you’ll receive the full amount that you won, because most states don’t require casinos to take out withholding taxes from gambling wins. You can ask the casino to withhold taxes, though, and usually they’ll comply.

4. By the way, you might not get anything.

When the attendant comes over to issue you your check or a hefty wad of cash, the first thing they’ll do is to check the machine. They need to verify that the slots are functioning properly and that your win wasn’t the result of a machine malfunction.

But wait—if it is a machine malfunction, that’s on the casino, right? You still get your money, don’t you?

Nope. In October 2016, a New York woman thought she’d won $43 million from a slot machine, but a casino attendant told her that the machine had malfunctioned. To compensate for the error, the casino offered her…a free steak dinner. Most slot machines have labeling that says, “Malfunctions void all pays and plays,” which protects casinos against these sorts of losses.

Unfortunately, the New York State Gaming Commission agreed with the casino that the woman was only entitled to her actual winnings, a whopping $2.25.

5. If you win more than a million dollars, you’ll only get part of the money.

You can decide to have the rest of the amount paid in full, but that’s not your only option. Most casinos will also let you take an annual fixed sum.

If you’re trying to get the biggest payout possible, the annuity is usually the smarter choice. It will make money management significantly easier and reduce your tax bill in some circumstances. Don’t worry, you don’t have to decide right away; the casino will give you 90 days to make your choice.

During that time, the casino will try its best to make you part of its marketing campaign. You’ll be invited to casino events, presented with massive checks, and interviewed by the local media. Of course you don’t have to take part in any of that if you don’t want to, but most winners get swept up in the experience.

6. If you continue to gamble, the casino will be watching you.

Make no mistake about it: When you’re gambling, you’re being intensely monitored by professionals. If you luck out and take the house for a boatload of cash, they’ll be keeping an extra close eye on you for the rest of your stay. For more on the way casinos treat you—before and after a big win—give our video below a look:

﻿

7. The casino might make you wait for a while.

Expect to wait awhile if you’ve won a massive jackpot. The casino will need to verify your win, inform managers, collect tax forms, check that you’re not on the state’s restricted list, and handle a bunch of accounting paperwork before you see a dime.

For some jackpots, payout can take hours, although the casino will work to handle it as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, in some cases, it’s out of their hands; some payouts are actually handled by game manufacturers, so you may wait days or weeks for your money.

If you’ve only won a few thousand dollars, you’ll probably get the money within minutes, but don’t stress out if it takes longer. The casino’s not trying to get out of paying. Your best bet is to go grab a meal at the casino’s restaurant and start calling banks to find a good rate on a CD.

8. If you’re a big winner, you’re incredibly lucky.

That depends on the slot machine, of course, but all of them pay out on a relatively infrequent basis. Otherwise the casinos wouldn’t make any money.

Let’s say that your slot machine has 64 stops on each reel. Your chances of getting a jackpot would be roughly 1 in 262,144 , and many machines have far more than 64 stops per reel.

If you’re looking for some good news, the law is on your side, to some degree. In most states, the slot machine must pay back at least 75 percent of the money it takes in. Percentages vary quite a bit, and casinos don’t have direct control over those percentages.

You might also be a cheater, of course, but your chances of successfully cheating a slot machine are even lower. To get away with cheating, you’d need to directly alter the erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) chip on the inside of the machine—something that the staff would certainly detect. You can’t “hack in,” either, since that part of the machine has no network access.",This Is What Really Happens When You Hit A Casino Jackpot
They are negotiating for a better contract. ,https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/rick-morty-season-4-delayed-dan-harmon/,"Rick and Morty fans have been freaking out over the recent reveal that season 4 isn't officially happening yet. Series co-creator Dan Harmon said as much in response to a fan lambasting the creators for doing things like Rick and Morty-themed music videos, and now he's having to walk back those statements a bit.

Here's what Harmon had to say about why Rick and Morty season 4 isn't confirmed yet, while talking to Kevin Smith during a recent episode of his ""Smodcast"" show:

""....I don't want any 'Rick and Morty' fan hearing that and going like 'Harmon's on Smith's podcast and he's talking about how it's great how he takes as much time off as he wants.' The reason why we we're not working on 'Rick and Morty' right now ain't because I figured out that I don't need to impress you (laughs). It's a little something called contract negotiations, and it's gotten complicated this time around.""

That explanation reveals a lot of about where things stand with Rick and Morty right now. Here are the big dots to connect:

Rick and Morty saw a big expansion in viewership during season 3, growing from a cult-hit wonder to the No. 1 comedy on cable TV. The show's popularity grew beyond the viewing audience, spilling into mainstream pop-culture, thanks in large part to the McDonald's Szechuan sauce debacle. With the show's breakout hit status, creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland are no doubt in negotiation for bigger payouts from the show - which Cartoon Network / Adult Swim may be resisting.

At this point, it would seem like the leverage is mostly in Harmon and Roiland's corner. Rick and Morty was a huge draw for Adult Swim in 2017, even helping to lift other adult swim programming. The show served as a lead-in to the increasingly popular Toonami anime block on Saturday nights, with the specific block of Rick and Morty / Dragon Ball Super giving the network a solid boost in both ratings and branding. It wouldn't seem smart for Adult Swim to lose Rick and Morty just as the big advertising and publicity dollars are starting to sprout up - especially since a streaming service like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon TV would almost surely scoop the show up - if cable networks like FX, Comedy Central or TBS didn't do it first.

However, the other side of this equation is Harmon and Roiland's devil-may-care approach to making the show. Rick and Morty is infamous for its long delays between seasons, with even some of the show's crew members having been quoted as complaining about the snail pace of production. If Cartoon Network is only willing to give the showrunners more money in exchange for firmer deadlines and structure, it's not hard imagining them (Harmon in particular) pushing back against that corporate mandating with claims that 'getting it right' outweighs 'getting it soon.'

"Sheila Minor Huff, a museum technician who later achieved one of the highest possible designations at the Department of the Interior. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/twitter-mystery-photo.html,"Last week, hundreds of people were engaged in a search for a woman named Sheila.

It began when an illustrator’s investigation into the archives of marine legislation turned into a very different kind of historical deep dive.

Candace Jean Andersen wanted to write a picture book about the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, so she asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for some information.

It sent her an article on the subject. There, buried in dozens of pages of dense text, was a photograph of attendees at the 1971 International Conference on the Biology of Whales in Virginia, a gathering of some of the most prominent experts in marine biology. The 38 people pictured appeared to be mostly white and all men, except for one: a young black woman wearing a bright headband, her face partly obscured by the man in front of her.

Ms. Andersen said the men were named in a caption but the woman was not. “My curiosity nagged at me, not knowing who the woman in the photo was, or perhaps what she may have contributed to the conference,” she said.","She Was the Only Woman in a Photo of 38 Scientists, and Now She’s Been Identified"
Red hair and blue eyes (0.017% of people.) ,https://www.simplemost.com/rarest-hair-eye-color-combination/,"You're more likely to be struck by lightning than to meet someone with this striking look!

Brown eyes, hazel eyes, green eyes, blue eyes — these are the standard shades for the windows to our soul. But what hair color most typically accompanies each eye color? We’ve all heard of the blonde-hair-and-blue-eyed combo, as well as the brown hair and hazel eyes.

But, what’s the rarest combination to actually see together?

According to Medical Daily, the most unlikely pairing is red hair and blue eyes. The traits for both red hair and blue eyes are recessive, so the chances of these two coming together are very rare.

Only 1 to 2 percent of the population has red hair and only 17 percent have blue eyes. Now, we’re not mathematicians, but the odds of both occurring simultaneously do seem pretty darn slim!

Adobe

To put it in perspective, you’re more likely to get struck by lightning — .03 percent chance — than you are to meet a person with red hair and blue eyes (coming in at .017 percent). How crazy is that?

Adobe

So, if not blue, what is the most common eye color for those with auburn locks? Redheads most typically have brown, hazel or green eyes.

Interested in learning some other fun facts about redheads? Here are just a few:

1. Redheads Go Gray Slowly

Red strands hold their pigment a lot longer than other colors, so redheads don’t have to be concerned with graying. Their ginger locks will simply turn more rose gold with age and eventually they’ll eventually turn completely white.

Talk about getting better with age!

Adobe

2. Red-Haired Emojis Have Arrived

Redheads are unique, and therefore, probably used to feeling a little excluded (those with blue eyes even more so). But red-haired emojis recently hit smartphones everywhere, so your texting’s about to get even more inclusive!

Adobe

3. Redheads Produce Their Own Vitamin D

According to a study by ScotlandsDNAproject, those with red hair can create more vitamin D in low-light conditions than those who have darker skin or hair. So, there’s less worry of a vitamin D deficiency for redheads.

4. Red Hair Is Thicker

Redheads have fewer strands of hair on their heads.

On average, they have 90,000 strands, while blondes have 110,000 and brunettes have 140,000. But the strands that they do have are thicker, and therefore make up for the lower volume.

5. Gingers Are More Sensitive To Temperature

The gene redheads carry, MC1R, may cause the body’s temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated more quickly, making those with red manes more sensitive to cold temperatures, according to a study. If you have red hair and find yourself getting cold easier than most, now you know why!

She doesn't like her location being revealed on social media. ,https://mashable.com/article/emma-watson-selfies-fans,"Emma Watson is no stranger to celebrity. The actress has been in the public eye ever since she scored the role of Hermione Granger at age 10. While the spotlight has given the actress more roles and a social justice platform, it has also made her more vulnerable.

In an interview with Vanity Fair, Watson revealed why she opts out of selfies with fans -- it's a matter of being tracked.

""For me, it's the difference between being able to have a life and not,"" she said. ""If someone takes a photograph of me and posts it, within two seconds they've created a marker of exactly where I am within 10 meters. They can see what I'm wearing and who I'm with. I just can't give that tracking data.""

Instead of a photograph, Watson prefers to offer fans an autograph or a conversation.

""I’ll say, 'I will sit here and answer every single Harry Potter fandom question you have but I just can’t do a picture.'""

Watson's concern is completely understandable considering the intensity of the Harry Potter fandom -- which often borders on obsession.

""I have met fans that have my face tattooed on their body. I’ve met people who used the Harry Potter books to get through cancer. I don’t know how to explain it, but the Harry Potter phenomenon steps into a different zone,"" she said. ""A big part of me coming to terms with it was accepting that this is not your average circumstances.""

Through living and learning, Watson has crafted a carefully maintained balance between her private and public lives, and has learned to be discerning of when and how to connect with fans.

""I have to carefully pick and choose my moment to interact. When am I a celebrity sighting versus when am I going to make someone’s freakin’ week? Children I don’t say no to, for example.""",This is why Emma Watson avoids taking selfies with her fans
"""Go."" This gave permission to attempt the landing. ",https://www.iflscience.com/space/this-single-word-saved-the-first-moon-landing-from-disaster-at-the-final-moment/,"A couple of years ago, a man named Jack Garman passed away. You might not have heard of him, but he had a pivotal role to play in the Apollo 11 lunar landing. And it culminated in a single word that meant the landing could go ahead.

Back in 1969, John “Jack” Garman was working at NASA’s Mission Control Center at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. He was a computer engineer, involved in making sure the computer that ran the spacecraft worked as intended.

This computer was called the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC). It was used by the astronauts to navigate and control the spacecraft, using a rudimentary number display and keyboard called a DSKY. They would input controls on this and the spacecraft would respond. Hey presto.

But during the landing attempt on July 20, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on board the lunar lander, something went wrong. An error mode flashed up on the AGC, called a 1202 alarm, as they were descending to the surface. For a few seconds, no one knew what to do, putting the mission in jeopardy.

Jack Garman, pictured right, worked at NASA from 1966 to 2000. NASA

“It was very Rube Goldberg but it worked,” Jack Garman told me back in 2013, when I interviewed him for All About History magazine. “It was strange, different, to have a system, a vehicle, that was run by computer. I mean today even our cars are run by computers, but back then almost all the systems were analogue.”

The AGC was designed to display an alarm when the computers got overloaded. The 1202 was one of those alarms, one of many. It basically meant that mission’s guidance computers were struggling with the amount of data they were receiving, caused by a switch being in the wrong position. Amy Shira Teitel has a good description of it over at Vintage Space if you want to learn more.

But when the astronauts reported that it kept popping up during the descent, nerves started to fray, as no one was quite sure what it meant.

“I tell you, my heart hit the floor,” Charlie Duke, who was responsible for talking between the crew and mission control at NASA, told the New York Times in 2016.

Well, it turns out someone did know the cause of the alarm. Jack Garman, on the advice of Gene Kranz – one of the flight directors for the mission, famed for his role in Apollo 13 – had fastidiously studied all the different error codes.

During a simulated landing, a 1202 alarm had caused the mission to be aborted. Kranz had been furious, and asked Garman to study every single possible program alarm that could happen. “I went and studied up on all the alarms, every one of them, and I wrote a little cheat sheet,” said Garman.",This Single Word Saved The First Moon Landing From Disaster At The Final Moment

"""You don't have to eat it."" ",https://snotty-noses.com/blog/hidden-dangers-one-bite-rule-and-what-do-instead,"Picky eaters, whether they are toddlers or older children can be SO frustrating, especially when it comes to trying new foods. Introducing your fussy eater to new foods can be particularly challenging. Many people use the ""one bite rule for picky eaters"" (aka the ""one polite bite"" or ""one bite rule for fussy eaters"") but feeding professionals are increasingly aware that it has negative side effects. So what can we do to help our kids try new foods instead?

I remember a meal a few years ago. I had spent ages cooking something “new and exciting” that the whole family would love. It contained only accepted ingredients, what could go wrong? Surely my children would try one tiny little bite? Actually, I was banking on the kids trying the new food and loving it first time off. How foolish!

It was a pleasant summer evening and we were eating outside in the dappled shade.

I put the dinner down. Triumphant. Expecting.

I waited for the round of applause, the cheers of “hooray! This looks yummy! Something new and tasty!”

And that’s when it happened.

Nothing.

Nope.

Nada.

Worse.

“Yuck! What’s that?” they wailed. (OK, obviously not my husband who was doing his best to encourage them.)

“You’ll love it!” I cried. “It’s got ALL your favourites in.”

They didn’t want to try it.

It was new.

It was unknown.

By now, I was getting frustrated. I’d just spent ages, toiling love sweat and tears and I was met with this response.

They wouldn’t even try it.

Not even one tiny little bite.

How did they know they didn’t like it if they wouldn’t try it? If they didn’t eat it, there wasn’t anything else for dinner. I was going to have 4 ravenous children who would be waking up in the middle of the night looking for food.

Help!

I wanted to scream.

I wanted to shout.

I wanted to command them to eat it.

But I didn’t.

And that’s when I wondered about the One Polite Bite Rule in which you tell your children that they have to try just a teeny tiny bite of the food before they decide not to eat it.

I understand the temptation. I understand the frustration. I get it. Seriously. How do children know they don’t like something when they won’t even try it?

Surely they need to try “just one tiny little bite”? Then they’ll understand that it’s not so bad. Actually it’s quite good.

Or perhaps they’ll just leave it at that and we’ll try again another day.

Rethinking the One Bite Rule for Picky Eaters

The problem with the one bite rule for fussy eaters is that it’s a slippery slope. It’s a slippery slope to pressurising your children to eat their food.

In fact, let’s be honest. It IS pressuring your children to eat, even if it’s only “gentle pressure”.

And we all know that pressuring your children to eat is bad don’t we? We know that it doesn’t work. Well, perhaps you don’t, but there is a mountain of evidence that shows that pressuring your children to eat has long term negative consequences. At best, you make the object in question more undesired. At worse, you contribute to a bad relationship with food, emotional eating, possibly even bulimia.

Yes. Seriously. Pressuring your children to eat, even one tiny little bite can have negative side effects.

But the one bite rule for picky eaters isn’t pressuring your child, you’re just encouraging right?

Well, where do you draw the line? Are you letting them choose freely to eat or not eat that food? If not, you’re pressuring them, however well intentioned.

You create a bad food experience and your child will dig in their heels and in their mind a wall will go up. “I don’t like that food”, the wall will say.

You have now created an even bigger hurdle than before. You never know, that dislike for food may last a lifetime.

What you WANT to do is to create a “safe tasting experience”.

You want to make it pleasant.

You want your child to feel safe.

You want them to feel happy trying the new food.

You want them to feel in control of the food that they put in their mouth. After all, it’s their mouth.

Let them refuse.

If they want to, let them smell, touch and see the food.

Let them JUST put it in their mouth. (Yep, let them spit it out if they don’t want to eat it.)

Present them with a teeny tiny bit.

Let them make their own choices. That’s what we’re aiming for in the long term. We want our children to grow up and choose a healthy diet.

How to Present New Food to Children

I have since learnt my lesson about presenting my children with new food.

I never make it the whole meal.

make it the whole meal. I give them options (not their favourite food but other things they can eat if they want to. Please note ""options"" doesn't mean your kids get to pick out of the cupboard, they don't get to choose chocolate biscuits in they don't eat dinner. It means instead of just peas, offer carrots and peas and they get to choose which they want.)

(not their favourite food but other things they can eat if they want to. Please note ""options"" doesn't mean your kids get to pick out of the cupboard, they don't get to choose chocolate biscuits in they don't eat dinner. It means instead of just peas, offer carrots and peas and they get to choose which they want.) I use my poker face . I don’t want them to know that I desperately want them to try it. When they do try it, I do a silent happy dance (in my mind).

. I don’t want them to know that I desperately want them to try it. When they do try it, I do a happy dance (in my mind). I give them a tiny bit so they are not overwhelmed. (My favourite is to present soup in an espresso cup. So cute!)

so they are not overwhelmed. (My favourite is to present soup in an espresso cup. So cute!) I prepare myself for the fact that they probably won’t eat it, they probably won’t even touch it. That’s fine. It is up to them to choose what they want to eat.

It is really tough learning to trust your children. It’s really tough not to pressure them to eat. And sometimes I find myself saying “just try a little bit”.

But then I stop and I remind myself.

It takes patience and persistence to teach your children to love healthy food.

Every time I present my children with new food or food that they claim they don’t like, I remind myself that it takes around 15 times of actual trying a new food to decide whether you like it or not. It takes 15 times of willingly choosing to try that food. I am teach my children to have a good relationship with food and I am teaching them to love healthy food.

I remind myself of this frequently. I remind myself that as tempting as it may be, the One Bite Rule is NOT allowing them to make that choice of their own free will.

Halloween is one of the funnest times of the year, especially when you work in a funeral home. After all, what’s Halloween without an exchange of spooky funeral home stories?

I have to admit I read these stories for the first time while sitting home alone, and I’m still pretty spooked about them.

So gather around, my fellow funeral professionals, and let the scary funeral home tales begin:

#1: Gone in the blink of an eye

“We had a younger man a few weeks ago who passed suddenly. One night, after closing up and hitting the lights, we walked towards the back hallway. As I looked down the hall before heading out the door, I saw a man with dark hair and a dark suit at the end, just standing there. I thought it was a director. When I blinked, he was gone. The director with me that day was in a light gray suit, and had blonde hair.

The next day, I went to close the casket in the chapel. Lo and behold, it was the same gentleman that was in the hallway the day before. Two of my co-workers said they experienced similar events, such as when walking past his casket, they felt like they bumped into someone, but no one was there.”

#2: Turn the light on

“At least once a week we had to turn off the attic light at our funeral home. We never would turn it on, but we would always have to turn if off. We were then only ones that had access to the attic…”

#3: An encounter too scary for even a ghost hunter

“ …As I sat alone in the kitchen…I heard something. It was only a little sound at first and so I ignored it. But then it came again, louder this time. There was a steep spiral staircase that lead to the second floor, winding up from the corner of the small kitchen, and it was where the noise seemed to be coming from. Assuming it was simply one of the homeowners restless after dropping their son off in an institution, I glanced up.

It was coming down the stairs. I can’t say walking, because that wasn’t the case. It was just… floating isn’t even the right word. Just coming. Coming down the stairs, straight at me.

It had no eyes. It had no face. And yet somehow I knew it was looking at me, right at me, into the very depths of my soul. Then it spoke. I’m not sure how it spoke — I don’t think I actually heard anything, so perhaps it used some sort of telepathy? Either way I can recall the words to this very day: ‘You know what he did to us.’”

#4: The hands of the dead

“There aren’t many options in Atchison for funeral homes so almost everyone in town has been to all of them at some point in their lives for a service. I remember as a child sitting on a chair in the lobby of one of the more prominent funeral homes bored out of my mind during a visitation for a distant relative. A kid I knew from school walks up and says ‘hi’ and we start to chat when something catches my eye. Far down the hallway going into a closed off area of the funeral home I see the hands of an old man come around the corner and grasp onto the wall. Slowly the old man peeks his head around the corner and just stares blankly down the hallway into the visitation room. I’m thoroughly weirded out and look over at my friend who is staring down the hall, he turns to me and says ‘what is he doing?’. When we looked back the man is gone.

We didn’t ever really talk about it again until 20 years later, when I got a call from my old friend out of the blue. He says ‘this is going to sound crazy but do you remember the old man at the funeral home?’. I was a little hazy on it but I did remember. He continues to say, ‘well I was just there and my daughter saw him! During the viewing for my Uncle Bill she came over and asked my wife why the creepy man down the hallway was staring around the corner at Uncle Bill…. there wasn’t anyone there man.’

I could hear the fear in his voice and I instantly got chills. I have been back to that funeral home many times now and I have not seen anything else but I still get uneasy anytime I walk past that hallway..

#5: Graham cracker mystery

“I came home from school one typical day, and I always get home first before anybody does. I was in middle school at the time, so it wasn’t a big deal for me to be home by myself for a while. My dad was working since 6am and hasn’t been home yet. My mom was gone since 7ish. I was the only child at the time too. Anyways, I went to get a snack and brought it upstairs to play in my room. I had this old recliner chair in the corner of the room. I always sit in it when i eat my snack and watch TV or listen to music. I leaned over to the side to flip the foot rest and i felt an empty box of graham crackers. There wasn’t any plastic inside it to hold the crackers… I was like ‘hmm where did the hell did this come from?’. NOBODY in my family including myself liked graham crackers in the first place. By the way, I didn’t see it in the morning before I left for school. The house was locked up tight as a safe too!

So I asked my mom and dad about it and they said we never even buy that stuff. I’ve seen shadows lurking around in my newly remodeled room on the first floor. An interesting finding, while tearing out the floors/walls in the room upstairs… we found little toys for a boy to play with. And I assume it was that little boy’s toys who died in the fire :(. Here is the most creepiest thing about the house ever: my parents told me this like a year after we finally moved out of the haunted house. They told that my room on the first floor was a funeral showing room! The house used to be a funeral home..ugh. I know they were telling the truth because my dad reminded me that when we were remodeling the room, we found an old screen door on the right side of the room and another screen door on the left side of the room. It was set up for people to walk in and see the casket and then walk out. That’s how they ran things in older style funeral homes back then.”

#7: An old man and his cane

“There was an elderly man who came in to pick out his own casket. He told my father that he was terminally ill and that he had about a month to live. The man was very easy to please, he wanted a simple casket, simple sermon, a few songs and a few loved ones. He did how ever have one very strange request, he wanted to be buried with his cane on top of the casket. He explained to my dad that the men in his family that have died before him all were buried with their cane outside their casket. He made the joke that it was because he would need it when he woke up out of the casket and would go on a walk with Jesus. My father promised the man his wishes and the man left happy.

Sure enough about a month later the gentleman passed and his funeral went perfectly as planned. He had a sweet, simple service, with about 20 close friends and family, a few songs he picked out and his daughter sang a song to him. Fast forward about an hour after the funeral, and to the burial site. It was a nice little area with a handsome gravestone with an angel carved on it. My father gave very strict instructions to the grave digger that after the casket was put in the cane was to be placed on top, then the dirt is to be added. The man said he understood and my father left because he had to prepare for another funeral.

The next day a man from the cemetery came to the funeral home saying that he thinks someone left an item by the grave. It was the man’s cane! My father was so upset because he gave very strict instructions to the digger about the placement of the cane and told him the importance of it to the man. My father was very distraught because he felt like he failed the mans last wishes. My father took the cane to his office and was going to call the family and ask if they wanted to have it. And this is when it started. The cane was everywhere.

The cane would show up in all of the different rooms around the funeral home. We would see it hanging on door knobs, on chairs, leaning against walls, in the bathrooms, ON MY BED! We knew for a fact that the cane was haunted by the old man and he did not seem too pleased that he didn’t have his cane in his grave. (To be continued)

#8: Scared of the living, not the dead

“As I was pulling my charge out of the back of the removal van at about 2 in the morning, I saw three large men round the corner from the side of our mortuary building. I was working alone (in heels and a pencil skirt). The way our mortuary building, funeral home, garage, and prep area were set up, I was cornered. I left the body half in/ half out of the van, ran into our prep room, locked the door, and called the cops. I’m sure those guys were probably more scared than I was, once they got close enough to see what I had been doing! People ask if I’m scared of picking up dead bodies. I always tell them that it’s the living people that’ll hurt you, not the dead ones.”

#9: Playing with fire

This is an excerpt from the new homeowner of the formed Jacobs Funeral Home in Kokomo, Indiana who purchased the property in 2000:

“Many people that have worked here or rented have told me about hearing sounds and seeing black shadows during all hours. One of the things that has turned me to wonder about all this even more is the children saying things about a “black fog” in different rooms during the night.

It’s apparent that something is causing all this. Whispers in the hallways, lights going out and coming back on, leaving rooms with the lights off and seeing them turn on. Even water turns on and off. Finally when the people remodeling came to me and said something about a high pitch drilling noise from the basement one afternoon I told myself and my wife I’d humor everyone and speak with a local psychic. I did so the same afternoon of the drilling.

The psychic was a nice little lady but, I was frustrated that all she kept saying and insisting to me was that I shouldn’t remodel and stir up the spirits in the building and I’m causing nothing but problems some people in the community would choose to forget. It was a creepy thing to say I thought and it really wasn’t what I wanted to hear from her. She didn’t help and what she told me, I didn’t feel was what I was calling her about but, either way she refused to come over and answer questions about black figures in this building for me and she kept on and on about stopping what I was doing to the building. Before the phone call ended I remember very well the last thing she said, “You sir are playing with fire”. Whatever that means but, it stuck with me.

So after a few days I called a local Christian preacher who prayed for me and claimed I was involved in a demonic process and should come to church Sunday morning before it’s too late. He did finally come over to the building and did some water sprinkles of whatever it’s called around the place but, when he left everything started freaking out. Lights would turn off and on and we started getting light headed sometimes when we walked through areas of the building. So now every since that day my wife won’t stay in a room alone when we are here. We still really don’t have any clear answers on the building, the items inside, or it’s terrible history but, after we finish remodeling we hopefully clean and rid ourselves of the spirits of Jacob’s Funeral Home. We hope by getting rid of the items we are unearthing that the spirits will go with them to people who can help them. If you’d like to be involved you can look for all the items we find here at the funeral home to be placed on eBay for auction.”

#10: The other occupants

“Most nights as we were returning to quarters from a run, my partner and I would scope the parking lot for vagrants or people that shouldn’t be there before we opened the bay doors. While looking on more than one occasion, we would see a light on in the adjacent building on the top floor. There should have been no lights on. Figuring someone had gotten inside, we would watch the building for more lights. No other lights ever came on, but on every occasion a young woman in a dress would come to the window and stare at us.

One night, after seeing the figure, we got brave and called some law enforcement friends from the area to help us search the building. We went to the room that had the light on expecting to find a vagrant camped out there. The only thing we found was a room that had untouched dust on the floor and no light bulbs in the sockets. We got the willies and split. We never went back into that building at night.”

"Drugstore brands tend to use less expensive, synthetic ingredients. Further down they also mention that high-end brands usually have a wider range of classic colors. ",https://www.healthyway.com/content/the-differences-between-drugstore-makeup-and-high-end-makeup/,"If you love makeup or other beauty products, you probably have your go-to brands that routinely fill your makeup bag—and some are probably expensive. But with that higher price tag, are you automatically getting a better product? High-end makeup aficionados often claim their products have better quality ingredients than their drugstore counterparts. Nevertheless, a quick scroll through your Instagram feed shows makeup fans everywhere achieving incredible looks with drugstore brands as well. In the battle of makeup types, which type reigns supreme? Here’s my personal makeup confession: I buy almost all of my beauty products from department stores or high-end retailers. The extra cost is justifiable because I work from home, I mostly reserve my pricey makeup for special occasions, and the products last for months. As I’m darting out of the department store, the highly saturated pigments of lipsticks and blushes capture my attention. Plus, I’m lured in by the promise of a mascara that won’t flake or a high-shine lip gloss that creates the perfect pout. At different times in my life, though, I’ve used my fair share of drugstore cosmetics. In my college years, the price point of drugstore brands was more affordable to me, and I loved experimenting with the newest products on the market. If I had any issues with an item I’d purchased, I could easily exchange or return it. But somewhere along the line, I stopped using drugstore makeup altogether, and I began to believe the best cosmetics came from high-end retailers. In my search to find quality beauty products, was it necessary for me to switch from drugstore makeup to high-end cosmetics? Or could I have found great products at both price points? To compare these two makeup categories, I spoke to several experts—a cosmetic chemist, a geneticist, a pharmacist, and a makeup artist—to gather insights across a variety of cosmetic specialties and find out the differences between drugstore makeup and high-end makeup. Suffice to say, it might be worth revisiting the products you’ve been using—after all, you may find some items are worth the splurge and others are worth the save.

All ingredients aren’t created equal.

Soraya Ali-Hope has some knowledge about the cosmetics industry; she’s worked in it for 34 years. “All ingredients are not created equal,” says the president, founder, and cosmetic chemist for the Octagon Marketing Group, which helps producers formulate cosmetics. “Raw materials can be sourced from different countries and may be extracted from natural sources or synthesized in the laboratory.” In general, the mass-market brands like CoverGirl or Revlon incorporate more synthetic and less expensive ingredients into their products. On the other hand, high-end products, like MAC or Bobbi Brown, often have premium formulations, higher quality ingredients, more pigment, and include more costly technologies in the creation of those products. Ali-Hope says high-end makeup brands regularly utilize “advanced chemistry for both liquids and dry powders.” Frequently, high-end makeup has cleaner ingredients, fewer fillers, and a range of shades to suit your skin’s individual needs, and they may have a performance advantage over their drugstore “dupes” (less-expensive products that are similar to high-end versions). Additionally, many drugstore lines have professional makeup artists test and promote their products after they have launched in store. With high-end cosmetics, it’s not uncommon for them to have artists involved in the formulation of each collection from start to finish.

The quantity of the ingredients varies.

Do two products that purportedly contain the same active ingredients perform the same? Not necessarily. Consumers may not be aware that companies will promote their products as containing particular ingredients…while the quantity of those special ingredients vary among brands. Therefore, you might not get the same beneficial results from one product to another. “There are definitely differences in ingredients and formulations for high-end brands over drugstore brands, particularly in the clinical quantity used in the formulations,” explains Neal Kitchen, chief geneticist and COO at makeup brand HydroPeptide. “Peptides (short chains of amino acids) are a great example of ingredients where the type of peptide and the quantity of the peptide are both essential for how effective the ingredient will be on your skin.” Two brands could market the same ingredient but have significantly different results on the skin, explains Kitchen, if one brand is using it for marketing purposes rather than the clinical impact.

It’s a case of convenience versus performance.

Peter Matravers, PharmD, chief scientific officer for makeup seller Arbonne, explains the uses for high-end and drugstore brand makeup. “For daily maintenance, functionality, and simple needs, I would say stick to mass-market brands if budget is an issue. Not all of your products need to be premium,” he says. “Beyond general maintenance,” he continues, “you want to be aware of your specific needs that would benefit from premium, more performance-based formulas that deliver better results.” Don’t go running off to high-end retailers just yet! At the end of the day, there seems to be a place for both drugstore and high-end cosmetics in your makeup bag. Drugstore brands formulate their products with affordability in mind. High-end products, on the other hand, are formulated to better suit an individual’s preference and goals, meaning the products serve more specific functions in your beauty routine.

What does the makeup artist have to say?

Chicago-based makeup artist, Vanessa Valliant from Valliant Beauty, says, that high-end products “tend to have a better range of classic colors for customers. While they may showcase a certain collection each season, they aren’t solely focused on trends. However, drugstore makeup brands love to pour out every trendy color that hits the market each season.” Valliant—whose customer base includes celebrities, brides, fashion models, and everyday women—primarily favors high-end makeup brands due to their consistent formulations and wide range of pigments for each skin tone. Drugstore brands, though, have the advantage when it comes to price point and experimentation. They can also be helpful when trying out new products (like the latest matte lipstick or a metallic eyeshadow you’ve been curious about) without committing to a higher cost. Although not all ingredients are created equal, Vaillant says it’s all about the application of the makeup that can make or break your look. “Anyone can take drugstore or high-end makeup and blend them to perfection on the skin, achieving an overall, amazing makeup look,” she says. “There are a few high-end makeup lines that have more longevity due to their waterproof ingredients. But for the most part, with the proper application, you can achieve longevity out of both drugstore and high-end cosmetics.” Valliant tells her clients that there are some products worth the extra investment; additionally, she tells them there are drugstore items that work well and won’t cost them a small fortune. Ultimately, the choice as to which makeup is right for you depends on your skin’s needs, the goals you have for the product, your likes and dislikes when it comes to specific cosmetics brands, and your budget.

So, when should you splurge? When should you save?

Splurge

Valliant recommends buying skincare products, foundation, a well-made set of brushes, and lipstick from high-end brands. “Beautiful makeup begins with healthy skin. I love a good skincare line like Kiehl’s because your skin is the largest organ, and it must be hydrated daily. Plus, they have a wide range of products to fit your skin type,” she says. “Also, it’s important to spend a little extra money on foundation … because it tends to perform better on the skin, and it’s created to mimic the look of real skin. My personal choices for foundations and concealers are by Tom Ford and Dior.” For brushes,” she continues, “I like NARS. Well-crafted brushes last longer; they’re softer on the skin and are more tailored to specific areas of the face. Lastly, purchase your lipsticks from a high-end brand like Bobbi Brown. There are many colors and textures to choose from, and they’re designed for a variety of skin tones. You can’t go wrong with a lipstick like that!”

Save

Valliant suggests purchasing mascara, eyeshadow palettes, blushers, highlighters, and eye pencils at the drugstore. “Maybelline mascara is hands down the best mascara on the market—you’ll find one in every professional makeup artist’s kit,” she says. “If you’re looking for the latest trends, NYX carries the latest eyeshadow palettes, blushes, highlighters, and eye pencils. Nowadays, you can find a wide range of products to fit your budget and needs at most drugstores.”

What’s our takeaway: Drug Store or High-End Makeup?

Regardless of whether you prefer drugstore cosmetics or high-end makeup brands, it’s important to focus on what best suits your skin’s needs, from the price point to the wearability of the product. In the long run, the makeup brands that are right for you are the ones that nurture your skin and help you look and feel your best—regardless of the differences in how they’re made or where you bought them.",The Differences Between Drugstore Makeup And High-End Makeup

The soda doesn't explode everywhere when you shake it due to the pressurization within the submarine. Video in comments. ,https://www.wired.com/story/how-escape-sunken-submarine/,"Ever since human beings created the first submarines, there have been other, more claustrophobic people who have stared at the devices and thought: “Nope.” For many, the thought of the pipe- and equipment-filled narrow metal confines is enough to trigger a fear of drowning—even when they’re standing on dry land. But everyone who has ever looked at a sub, even those of us so enamored with the underwater beasts that we sleep in custom-sewn adult-sized submarine pajamas, has at some point wondered: If the boat goes down, is there any way out?

Yes! Escape plans and tools are almost as old as submarine technology itself. Although the odds may always be stacked in favor of the merciless, cold depths of the sea, a few dozen lucky people have taken that unintentional ride down to the ocean floor and lived to see daylight again. Their stories teach us how to get out.

Adapted from In the Waves: My Quest to Solve the Mystery of A\a Civil War Submarine, by Rachel Lance. Buy on Amazon. Courtesy of Dutton

In 1851, German submarine inventor Wilhelm Bauer looked at two of his panting countrymen, slumped inside the hull of his creation. The boxy, 26-foot-long, human-powered early sub model was supposed to help win the ongoing war with Denmark, Germany’s neighbor to the north, but the odds of its successful use were looking grim. The crew of three had been trapped inside the submarine for hours, sitting and waiting for rescue.

The test day in Germany’s Port of Kiel had started normally. The men had crawled, as usual, through the hatch in the angular conning tower above the bow and taken their places: Bauer at the controls, and Witt and Thomsen each standing at one of the two massive hamster wheels that powered the boat’s propeller. Bauer gave the command. Witt and Thomsen lifted their legs and began to step on the spokes of the wheels, spinning them slowly like a giant human-powered waterwheel. The submarine began to move forward.

Bauer expected a graceful and smooth disappearance beneath the surface of the water, like an elegant metal seal. Instead the Brandtaucher (“Fire Diver”) plummeted unexpectedly, caroming wildly in an awkward, unstoppable, and rapid descent into a depression in the harbor floor that was 16 meters deep. As she crashed into the seafloor and shuddered to a final stop, the three men were hurtled unceremoniously into the bow of the boat. They pieced themselves together, shaken but uninjured. However, Bauer, Witt, and Thomsen slowly came to the realization that they couldn’t get the boat out of the hole. They were stuck.

At first, they just waited. And waited. For at least five hours, according to them, they sat, wondering when rescue would come. Their dive had been witnessed by onlookers; they figured it was just a matter of time until the German Navy hauled them back up to safety and fresh air. Someone had in fact noticed, and eventually the clanking of chains and anchors on the hull indicated that boats and divers were poking around the wreck site. But Bauer was growing concerned about the air … and the anchors.",How to Escape From a Sunken Submarine

When he shakes your hand, you feel it. Arnie is still a giant man, even at 70. He's big in stature and huge in personality.

The former Governor of California and star of — well, you know all his films — touched down in Melbourne on Friday for a charity fun run, a sports festival named after him and ... a spot of chess, apparently.

""When you're playing chess, you cannot think about anything else otherwise you get beaten,"" he says.

""You have to stay focused every second. It's a really great form of disconnection from everything else.""

It's part of his routine and it keeps him sharp mentally. But you don't still look like The Terminator in your eighth decade on the planet without shifting a bit of tin.

""I lift all the time, I go every day to the gym,"" he told news.com.au on the first day of the Arnold Sports Festival at the Melbourne Convention and Entertainment Centre.

""I bicycle, I lift, I ski, I do everything else.""

The surprising thing isn't that he still works out, it's the sheer amount he gets done before most of our alarms go off — and before we snooze them three or four times.

""I work out every day, I get up at 5am and I ride the bike to the gym. I work out there for an hour then I ride home and have breakfast. My day starts like that. Before I ever get to the office, I've already done my workout for the day. I've done something.""

He knows staying in shape isn't easy, but there's a trick to it. ""Don't think"". Simple, right? Arnie explains: ""(Working out) is not just difficult to do in the beginning. It's always going to be difficult. I say to people, 'don't think'.

'Just get up, get on your bicycle, ride the bike, then start thinking. Because as soon as you start thinking, you will have 5000 reasons why you shouldn't do it.'

""I'm in such a routine now that I don't even ask myself, 'should I or shouldn't I'.""

If you've ever watched Pumping Iron, the 1977 documentary about Schwarzenegger's quest for a sixth consecutive Mr Olympia title, you'll know lifting for him was never a chore. He loved it. He loved the pain and he chased ""the pump"" fanatically.

(He'd go on to win seven Mr Olympia titles, a feat only bettered by behemoths Lee Haney and Ronnie Coleman, who won eight apiece).

These days Schwarzenegger still finds ways to compete, even if his body can't do what it once could.

""I'm kind of competing all the time but it's in different things,"" he said on Friday.

""I left body building, then it was competing in the box office with my movies, then you compete when you run for governor ... it's always a competition one way or the other, I thrive on that.

""The key thing is you have a very clear vision of where you want to get then you just follow through with the whole thing.""

They will never connect to real people. ,https://www.businessinsider.com/555-phone-number-tv-movies-telephone-exchange-names-ghostbusters-2018-3,"When TV shows and movies need to use a phone number as part of the story, they typically use one that starts with 555. We spoke with an official historian at AT&T to find out why these three numbers were chosen.

It turns out that the answer has a lot to do with the way telephone numbers evolved over time. Following is a transcript of the video.



""Pick up your phone and call the professionals: Ghostbusters.""



Narrator: Did you ever wonder why phone numbers in TV shows and movies always start with the numbers 555?

555-1125.



It's 555-3455.



555-2401.



Narrator: The short answer is that most 555 numbers are not working numbers, so real people won't be harassed if diehard fans try to call them. 555 was an exchange combination that was not used very often in the American telephone system.



You may get a wrong number, or no number at all.



Narrator: An FCC contractor called the NANPA, or North American Numbering Plan Administration, is tasked with assigning numbers for use. 555-1212 is still used for directory assistance and 555-4334 is reserved for assigned national use. But a set of 100 555 numbers have been officially designated for use in Hollywood, 555-0100 through 555-0199.



Cory Gillis, 555-0176.



Narrator: Back in the early '90s, 555 numbers outside that range could be reserved for information service providers, but this program was shut down by the NANPA in 2015. While those other numbers might one day be put back in circulation, the 100 reserved for TV and movies will not, so they will always be safe for use.

So, how specifically did 555 become the famous number that it is today?



Decades ago, phone numbers used to look a lot different. They consisted of a word and a five-digit numerical code. The word was a telephone exchange name, and the number was assigned to a specific phone in that area.



Sheldon Hochheiser: Up until 1919, all telephone calls were manual. You had to start by speaking to an operator.



This is WY 5-2240.



Narrator: References to this system can be seen in the names of movies, like ""BUtterfield 8."" And songs like the Glenn Miller Orchestra's ""PEnnsylvania 6-5000,"" which calls hotel Pennsylvania in New York.



Hochheiser: These were based on names that could be easily understood verbally.

Narrator: Eventually, phone companies switched to a system where customers had to dial themselves.



We are changing your telephone service over to dial. Take up your receiver, and always listen for the dial tone.



Narrator: Phone numbers were reached using numbers corresponding to the first two letters of the exchange name. So if you wanted to call Pennsylvania 6-5000, you would dial 73-6-5000. Since seven corresponds with PQRS on the keypad, and three corresponds to DEF. For Butterfield, you would start with 28.

So, with this in mind, let's take another look at 555.



Hochheiser: Now, some combinations for the first two letters of a word worked better than others. One of the combinations that were very difficult to correlate to useful exchange names was 55.



Narrator: On the keypad 5 has the letters JKL. Letters, which when placed next to each other, don't make many words or exchange names. So there were not many real phone numbers starting with 55.



Hochheiser: Klondike, which has become well known, is about the only one.



Klondike 4-2106, Los Angeles, please.



Then call Klondike 5-3226.



Narrator: These numbers were often shortened to just the first two letters plus the five-digit code. Since Klondike 5 was not frequently assigned, it found other uses. Bell systems noted in an official guide that the 55X exchange was reserved for ""radiotelephone.""



The portable transmitting and receiving radio unit that makes it possible to combine radio and wire telephony for communication purposes.



Narrator: This was actually a very small group of numbers used in early mobile phones. Klondike 5 was also a sample number used in old phone-company advertisements, and it began to be used in old movies and TV shows. Eventually, area codes were introduced allowing for more available phone numbers, and the exchange names were abolished, but the 555 trope is still used today in Hollywood.



What's the phone number of this store?

555-2310.

So, when the trailer for Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald was released, the fans got out their monocle to INSPECT.

The beginning of the trailer shows Hogwarts, something we're all familiar with. However, it also shows what could be a massive mistake. Wizards are shown apparating into the grounds, something we all know is impossible.

Apparition is a form of teleportation that could lose you a limb here and there (casually). In the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione tells Ron and Harry that you can't apparate into Hogwarts because it's protected by ""more than walls.""

We know, Dumbledore does it further down the track but he's Dumbledore and he can (don't @ us).

Anyway, fans were quick to notice to flaw and took to Twitter to let the world know how knowledgable they were in the subject of Harry Potter.

However, one fan pointed out an interesting thought. ""What if events in this movie ARE the reason you can't Apparate onto the Hogwarts grounds HMMM.""

Well damn.

Honesty. ,https://www.simplemost.com/swear-lot-probably-also-great-quality/,"If you have a little bit (or a lot of bits) of a problem with swearing, you may be in luck. Research suggests people who curse more are likely to be more honest. Really, we swear.

A small study conducted by the University of Cambridge in England surveyed 276 people about their foul-mouthed habits. People were asked about their favorite swear words and how often they use them. They were later asked questions about how often they attempt to shift blame to others, cheat at games or “try to take advantage” of others.

According to the data the scientists collected, those who swore the most tended to also lie the least. Co-author of the study David Stillwell says it comes down to socialization.

“There are two ways of looking at it. You might think if someone is swearing a lot, this is a negative social behavior,” Stillwell told The Daily Mail in an interview. “On the other hand, they are not filtering their language so they are probably also not putting their stories about what is going on through similar filters which might turn them into untruths.”

A second, much larger study that was accepted for publication in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science garnered similar results.

Studying 74,000 Facebook users, researchers compared curse words to language that typically accompanies truth-telling. Researchers compared how often people used profanity and words such as first-person pronouns like “me” and “worried.” In the end, their research showed that people who edited their language online also attempted to look cooler, despite having to bend the truth to do so.

So should you go ahead and drop that f-bomb? Well, we can’t actually advocate for that. But if anyone tries to wash your mouth out with soap, you can feel free to tell them that you—honestly—don’t want to change a damn thing.","If You Swear A Lot, You Probably Also Have This Great Quality"

Because only 5% of ALS sufferers live 20 years or longer after diagnosis. #StopClickbait,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinekee/what-is-als-neurodegenerative-disease-stephen-hawking,"Rare and often fatal, it’s also called Lou Gehrig’s disease after the famed baseball player who was diagnosed with it in 1939, and ultimately died of the disease. In the UK, where Hawking was born, it’s called motor neurone disease (MND).

ALS attacks the nerves that carry impulses from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles throughout your body, causing them to degenerate and die. This affects the ability of these muscles to perform the voluntary movements needed for walking, talking, chewing, lifting objects, and more. When the muscles no longer receive the messages to move, they begin to weaken, twitch, and waste away (atrophy), according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

""The disease robs the whole body of all active movements we make to do daily tasks,"" Lucie Bruijn, chief scientist at the ALS Association, told BuzzFeed News. In some cases there may also be cognitive impairment or dementia, Bruijn said, but many people with ALS (like Hawking) do not have changes in their ability to think.

Most people who get ALS are between the ages of 40 and 70, and it can affect anyone regardless of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Doctors do not know what causes ALS and there is currently no cure, although some treatments and technologies may help manage symptoms.",Stephen Hawking Lived For Over 50 Years With ALS.

It's Rachel. Meghan is her middle name. ,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/meghan-markle-apos-real-name-144327968.html,"“Meghan Markle” is the kind of charming, alliterative name that befits a storybook character or an A-list celebrity — which is probably why the Suits actress-turned-future royal chose it.

Queen Elizabeth gave her formal consent for Prince Harry to marry Markle on Thursday, March 15th, in the process reminding the world of both Harry and Meghan’s real names. As we often forget, Prince Harry’s given name is actually Henry, and Meghan Markle’s real name is…Rachel?

“My Lords, I declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between My Most Dearly Beloved Grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales and Rachel Meghan Markle,” Queen Elizabeth wrote via a letter from Buckingham Palace, “which Consent I am causing to be signified under the Great Seal and to be entered in the Books of the Privy Council.”

No, the queen is not misremembering Meghan’s name. She’s just being as formal as the situation requires. As fifth in line to the throne, Harry needs official permission from his grandmother, ruler of the Commonwealth, to marry under the Succession to the Crown Act, and it’s only natural Queen Elizabeth granted that permission using both parties’ full legal names.

Though the world knows the future royal as Meghan, it’s actually her middle name. Markle traded it for her first name, like many actors and actresses in Hollywood (Karen Lucille Hale, David Jude Law, and Christopher Ashton Kutcher come to mind). And, as Suits fans will remember gleefully, Markle’s real first name matches her Suits character’s name, Rachel Zane.

If you had no idea about Meghan — er, Rachel’s — real name, don’t fret: Neither did we. Until further notice, we’re going to go right on calling her Meghan to save us all the confusion.","Meghan Markle's real name isn't actually Meghan, and how did we not know this?!"

"French, due to the large growth of French-speaking African countries. ",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/05/31/ozy-french-language/9781569/,"Is French the language of the future?

Correction: An earlier edition of this story incorrectly spelled the name of a former French colony, and listed a country that is not in Africa.

The French are a proud bunch, especially when it comes to their mother tongue. So it must have been hard for them to take a backseat and watch English become the lingua franca of the 21st century.

But revenge could be on the horizon: The language beloved by Parisian poets, Russian aristocrats and pretentious grad students is set to reclaim its title when it becomes the world's most commonly spoken language by the year 2050, according to a study by Natixis, an investment bank.

The language beloved by Parisian poets, Russian aristocrats and international diplomats is set to reclaim its title.

French is currently ranked sixth among world languages, after Mandarin Chinese, English, Spanish, Hindi and Arabic. But it is gaining speakers quickly and, the study reports, will be spoken by 750 million in 2050, up from 220 million today.

Forgetting to speak Russian

From colonies to creditors

C'est possible? English enjoys an indisputable global popularity, and Mandarin has long been touted as the language of the future, given the size of China's population and its growing economic power, but French has a demographic ace up its sleeve: French-speaking populations are growing faster than English- and Mandarin-speaking ones.

Besides France and its best-known former colonies, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, the language of Molière and Manet is spoken in 28 other states — which happen to be some of world's fastest-growing nations. In Africa, French is the official schooling language of countries with increasingly high fertility rates like Mali in the north, and Guinea, Chad and Democratic Republic of Congo in the sub-Saharan region.

A demographic boom in these African states could bump the world's percentage of French speakers from 3 percent today to 8 percent by 2050.

French-speaking populations are growing faster than English- and Mandarin-speaking ones.

Meanwhile, China and many English-speaking countries are likely to experience a demographic slowdown, which could lead to an expected decline in the number of English speakers — from 8 percent to 3 percent of the world's population. For Mandarin, a drop from 10 percent to 8 percent is anticipated.

While this sounds like cause for celebration for Francophiles who might cringe at the notion of studying Mandarin, it's not time to pop open the Dom Perignon quite yet. Some skeptics think the predictions are overstated.

The study labels all the citizens of the states where French is the official language as ""French speakers,"" which is not strictly true. Countries like Belgium, for example, have more than one official language and, in some African nations, the tongue of the former colonial power is losing ground. Even in Algeria, only a third of the population can write in French.

""The number of people who speak French continues to increase, and the projections are indeed impressive, but they do not take into account the coexistence of languages, which is the reality in many countries,"" says Alexandre Wolff from the Observatory of the French Language.

So while French is on the rise, it may be a while before it can challenge the hegemony of English or the growing appeal of Mandarin Chinese. Which makes it a good time to dust off your old French phrasebook — but don't bid adieu to those Mandarin lessons just yet.

He got a 5 on his AP Art portfolio and got selected for the state’s Studio Art Exhibit. ,https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/teacher-snubs-trans-teens-art-project-happens-next-amazing-jasper-behrends/,"Jasper Behrends is a trans teenager who lives in northern Virginia and just graduated from high school in June.

As part of his art course, he had to devise a specific subject for his work, as well as a theme. His official concentration statement was: ‘How the people in my life relate to their gender and sexuality, especially in regards to body dysphoria.’

But then his art teacher thought it might be a little ‘inappropriate’ and what happened next is amazing. A viral tweet captured the internet’s attention and the rest is history.

Gay Star News asked Jasper to give us a rundown of how exactly it all played out.

How long have you been doing art?

I’ve been doing art for as long as I have been able to hold a crayon.

Ever since I was a kid, art has always been an outlet I use to express myself. It helped me through my parent’s divorce, it helped me through my depression and anxiety, and it’s now helping me through my transition and self exploration.

Your school’s administration told you to stop doing art that plays with gender and sexuality because it’s ‘inappropriate’ – how did this conversation go?

For those who don’t know, the AP Studio Art course is separated into two different segments: the Breadth section and Concentration section.

In the Breadth section, the student must show their range as an artist and mastery of space, shape, form, color, pattern, etc. In the Concentration section, the student gets to pick a specific subject and do an in depth study on it.

Each section contains 12 pieces and a complete portfolio is 24 pieces.

My official concentration statement was ‘How the people in my life relate to their gender and sexuality, especially in regards to body dysphoria.’

After starting my concentration, the school vice principal came to me after my art teacher informed the administration about my ‘potentially sensitive’ concentration subject. He said that although he had ‘no problem’ with the LGBTI theme, there is a ‘time and a place’ for ‘these things’ and that it did not belong in public schools.

He constantly reaffirmed to me that he ‘fully supported’ the LGBTI community, but made it blatantly clear that I could not bring it into the school.

I asked what specifically about it was ‘inappropriate’ because, at this point, I had only made one piece (Disconnection, which can be found on my website).

He told me that it was the nude breasts.

I told him that that was ridiculous because I had drawn tons of boobs in my breadth section and no one had even raised a finger. I also cited portfolios of students in the past who did things with nudity that weren’t forced to change their subject.

He claimed that the reason I couldn’t do my subject was because it ‘didn’t follow the school dress code’ and ‘just like how I can’t let a student walk in shirtless, I can’t let you do this stuff.’

Although I didn’t agree that art and school dress codes should be policed on the same level, I understood that this was obviously a risque topic.

I tried to compromise.

I asked: ‘Okay, so I can’t draw breasts. Can I draw shirtless guys though?’

Again citing the dress code, he said no.

The vice principal said that if I could tone it down, if I could make it more metaphorical, if I could make it so that the subject of transgender themes were ‘inferred’ and not so blatant, that I could continue.

‘But if I do that,’ I retaliated, ‘the entire theme of body dysphoria would be lost. This might make you feel uncomfortable, but it’s the everyday life of a transgender person. The point of this study is to show the raw, intense feelings of dysphoria.’

Why didn’t you stop and why do you think it was important to continue your art project on gender and sexuality?

After being shot down, I told my art teacher that I would rather just not turn anything in than switch my concentration or ‘make it less intense’ to suit those who might not be accustomed to being exposed to queer art.

My teacher, knowing that I was serious, told me that I should at least TRY to dull it down.

After a lot of arguing, I just decided to ignore everyone and keep doing it.

I just kept making art and didn’t listen to the administration.

I wasn’t able to put my work in any of the school art shows, I wasn’t able to even show my parents, but I was proud of what I was doing.

When you submitted the artwork, you got selected for the state’s Studio Art Exhibit! Can you outline what it’s all about?

Last year, I believe 34 students were chosen to be shown in the exhibit. To be chosen is a great honor considering there are thousands of AP Studio Art students — I asked my teacher how many, she said that there are roughly 15,000 students.

I got a five and that is a perfect score. The AP Art course is scored on the same scale as all other AP tests. For each portfolio, three different officials score each section on a one-five scale and then the scores are averaged together.

This is from the College Board website:

‘This exhibit showcases outstanding artwork created by students who submitted portfolios for the AP Studio Art Exam. Each work exemplifies the extremely high level of rigor, commitment, and accomplishment that AP Studio Art students can achieve. AP Studio Art students work with diverse ideas, materials, and processes to create art.’

What are you planning in the future?

Having graduated high school and Monroe Technology Center — a STEM school where I studied filmmaking — I start college at Virginia Commonwealth University next month where I plan to double major in English and cinema production.

I plan on taking the artistic skills that I have and apply them to my film career.

Will you continue making ‘inappropriate’ art?

I will definitely keep creating queer art. It’s literally the only type of art I truly enjoy doing.

Art is just materialized passion, and my passions stand with the queer community.

As long as any other iPhone. ,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/17/16291132/is-iphone-x-worth-it,"I usually spend about $1,300 on a new computer, and I usually expect it to stay in good shape for about four years — if not more. So if I’m spending over $1,000 on an iPhone, how long should I expect to use it for?

Smartphones have never had the longevity that modern computers have, often staying current for only two or so years. There are a good number of reasons why: For one, smartphones are historically cheaper, so it makes sense that companies would expect them to be replaced a bit sooner. But more importantly, smartphones are evolving at such a rapid pace that there’s frequently a good reason to buy a new phone every couple of years.

Sometimes, this is a good thing: in the last two years, many phones have added second cameras, much better image processing, HDR displays, and the increasingly universal USB-C connection standard — all reasons you might want to buy one. But other times, the continued improvements lead to big issues for people who’d rather not upgrade so often: after a couple of years, apps just tend to get slow. And often, unusably slow.

Phone processors are improving at a rapid pace

Like other smartphone features, processors are improving at an incredible pace — sometimes dramatically from year to year. And with developers routinely targeting the latest and great smartphones in order to make their apps capable of doing more than ever, people who don’t keep buying new smartphones may be left with a sluggish experience after only a couple of years.

The situation hasn’t gotten that much better. My iPhone 4S was getting hard to use after just two years. And while my iPhone 5S was still in relatively good shape after two years, its age was starting to show as I loaded up newer versions of iOS. This problem isn’t exclusive to iPhones either — my current phone, a Nexus 5X made by Google and LG, has become painfully slow when taking photos less than two years on. I haven’t owned newer iPhones, but I’m told they still start to see the same battery life and sluggishness issues past the two year mark. That’s not a huge surprise: we put a ton of wear and tear on these things, while technology is racing ahead.

So will the iPhone X buck all of that and last buyers longer into the future? I’m not so sure that it will. The iPhone X uses the same processor that’s inside of the iPhone 8, and there’s no doubt that Apple will release a new phone next year with an even faster processor, and same with the year after that. Even though the iPhone X has more advanced cameras and a future-facing design, the processor is going to age just as fast as every other iPhone.

There’s almost an implication here that the iPhone X isn’t built to last. At $999, this is a phone for tech enthusiasts and people with large amounts of disposable income, who will buy this in part to have the flashiest phone they can get — its distinctions are not meant to help pros who need more technical capabilities, after all; they’re largely aesthetic improvements and entertaining flourishes. If Apple releases an X2 next year (or maybe an XI?) and the X is no longer cutting edge, I suspect this same group of people will consider buying yet another iPhone.

For a more typical smartphone customer, who might like the idea of splurging on an iPhone X but doesn’t replace their phone every year, that isn’t a tenable proposition. And the idea that a $999 phone might age just as fast as a $699 phone — the price of the iPhone 8 — is to me, at least, quite frustrating. It doesn’t seem unreasonable to expect such an expensive device to last more than a couple of years.

You now have a choice of how much to spend and how often

This rapid aging wasn’t as much of an issue back when we were all (in the US, at least) locked into two-year contracts with our phone carriers, and most of the price of a new smartphone was hidden away — it just made sense to upgrade if you had the means.

In fact, you used to be discouraged from holding onto a phone for longer than two years. Phone carriers like Verizon and AT&T hid a device fee inside their monthly bills, which covered the cost of the subsidized phones they gave out. Keeping a phone for longer than your contract period meant you’d be paying for a new device even as you were using an old one. (This also means that slow upgraders may well have already paid more than $1,000 for a phone, simply by losing the money to hidden fees.)

But carriers have stopped doing that, and you’re now given a clear choice of how much to spend and how often. If you decide to go with an iPhone X, you may be looking at $1,000 every couple years. As long as phones are improving this quickly, it might make sense to spend less and upgrade just as frequently.

Of course, not everyone will see the need to upgrade after just two years. If you add a battery pack, battery life issues go away. If you don’t use a ton of apps, performance issues may not matter as much. And Apple doesn’t actually introduce groundbreaking features all that often. If you haven’t purchased a phone since the iPhone 5S, the biggest features you’d have missed out on were bigger screens, mobile payments, and an optional second camera. I guess you could throw 3D Touch in there, but I’m not convinced that feature has sold a single phone.

It’s processors and battery, not features, that’ll date the iPhone X

From that perspective, iPhones — and smartphones in general — may have a longer lifespan than many of us absorbed in the tech world would let on. I know plenty of people who hang onto phones for far longer than two years, even though I tend to grow impatient with my own two-year-old phones. Chances are, the iPhone X won’t grow dated through the introduction of revolutionary new features within the next two or three years. But that doesn’t guarantee it’ll remain a snappy performer with all-day battery life that far down the road.

And that’s really the problem I worry about. Even if you want to hang onto an iPhone X for three or four years, I think there’s an open question of how well it’ll run at that point. Every phone and computer has to slow down eventually, but when you invest more into one, you usually expect it to hang on somewhat longer. The iPhone X will likely age as quickly as any other iPhone — it’ll just look better while doing it.",How long should a $999 iPhone last?
