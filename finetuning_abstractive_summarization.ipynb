        "In this tutorial we will be fine tuning a transformer model for **Summarization Task**. \n",

        "\n",
        "1. ***Extractive Summary:*** the network calculates the most important sentences from the article and gets them together to provide the most meaningful information from the article.\n",
        "2. ***Abstractive Summary***: The network creates new sentences to encapsulate maximum gist of the article and generates that as output. The sentences in the summary may or may not be contained in the article. \n",

        "* However, unlike the other notebooks, in the tutorial, most of the sections have been created into functions, and they are called from the `main()` in the end of the notebook. \n",
        "* This is done to leverage the [Weights and Biases Service](https://www.wandb.com/) WandB in short.\n",
        "* It is a experiment tracking, parameter optimization and artifact management service. That can be very easily integrated to any of the Deep learning or Machine learning frameworks. \n",

        "    - **Text-2-Text** - According to the graphic taken from the T5 paper. All NLP tasks are converted to a **text-to-text** problem. Tasks such as translation, classification, summarization and question answering, all of them are treated as a text-to-text conversion problem, rather than seen as separate unique problem statements.\n",
        "    - **Unified approach for NLP Deep Learning** - Since the task is reflected purely in the text input and output, you can use the same model, objective, training procedure, and decoding process to ANY task. Above framework can be used for any task - show Q&A, summarization, etc. \n",

The filmmakers along with the Film Distributors Association and the Film Producers Association want to ensure better business for Pakistani films during the Eid holidays. The distributors, producers and filmmakers say they want to protect the interest of Pakistani movies as two big films, \"Yalghaar\" and \"Shor Sharaba\", along with others in the pipeline, are slated for an Eid release. \"If Tubelight also releases on Eid, it will certainly hit the business of these Pakistani films and that will not help our industry,\" actor Mustafa Qureshi said. Those trying to stall the release of the Salman KhaN- starrer are citing a law passed by the Federal Ministry of Information in 2010 which forbids the release of any Indian film on a Muslim holiday. \"If required we can even go to the court,\" producer Altaf Hussain said. Sohail Khan, the producer of \"Shor Sharaba\", said, \"My film is supposed to release on Eid-ul-Fitr and if the government doesnt stall Tubelight, I will not release it as a mark of protest.\" Hussain said the associations are planning to send an official letter to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as well. He confirmed a meeting was held in Lahore at which it was decided that the entire Pakistani film industry will join the planned protest to stop the release of \"Tubelight\" on Eid. \"It has been decided that all those related to the Pakistani film industry will support the Pakistani films that are supposed to release on Eid-ul-Fitr,\" Hussain added.</s><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad>'"

The BJP leader, who was confident of a good show by his party in the MCD polls, the results of which will be declared tomorrow, said the civic bodies needed to be \"revamped\" in order to deliver the services to the people more effectively. The first thing needed was a discussion on the unification of the three municipal corporations and there should also be an end to the practice of sending Delhi government officials to serve in the civic bodies, said the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports. \"Barring one, the two other civic bodies have been incurring losses. It would be more fruitful and efficient if all the three were merged,\" he said, referring to the north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations. The erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated into NDMC, SDMC and EDMC by the then Sheila Dikshit-led Delhi government in 2012. Goel predicted a \"thumping\" victory for the BJP in the MCD polls. He said the newly-elected BJP councillors will be trained on the functioning of the civic bodies and dealing with the bureaucracy. \n",

        "New Delhi, Apr 25 (PTI) The Income Tax department has issued a Rs 24,646 crore tax demand notice to Sahara Groups Aamby Valley Limited (AVL) after conducting a special audit of the company. The department, as part of a special investigation and audit into the account books of AVL, found that an income of over Rs 48,000 crore for a particular assessment year was allegedly not reflected in the record books of the firm and hence it raised a fresh tax demand and penalty amount on it. A Sahara Group spokesperson confirmed the development to PTI. \"Yes, the Income Tax Department has raised Rs 48,085.79 crores to the income of the Aamby Valley Limited with a total demand of income tax of Rs 24,646.96 crores on the Aamby Valley Limited,\" the spokesperson said in a brief statement. Officials said the notice was issued by the taxman in January this year after the special audit of AVLs income for the Assessment Year 2012-13 found that the parent firm had allegedly floated a clutch of Special Purpose Vehicles whose incomes were later accounted on the account of AVL as they were merged with the former in due course of time. The AVL, in its income return filed for AY 2012-13, had reflected a loss of few crores but the special I-T audit brought up the added income, a senior official said. The Supreme Court, last week, had asked the Bombay High Courts official liquidator to sell the Rs 34,000 crore worth of properties of Aamby Valley owned by the Sahara Group and directed its chief Subrata Roy to personally appear before it on April 28.  \n",
